And with the inclusion of the Google Play Movies and TV app for iOS gadgets, Apple loyalists get to enjoy an even wider selection and more options when it comes to choosing films and television shows for their entertainment. Here are some of the benefits of using this app on your iOS device. Google Play is available for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch, so almost anyone with iOS mobile devices can enjoy using the app. Even if the Google Play app doesn’t allow in-app purchases, you can buy content by opening your browser and going to the website of Google Play. Any movie or TV show you purchase on the site will then appear in your Google Play app. The rates for movie rentals are usually cheaper in Google Play than in iTunes. So you get to save more or you get to enjoy more movies and TV shows without emptying your wallet. There are free TV show episodes offered. You need to create a Google Wallet, but no charges will be applied. The free episodes are found at the bottom of the Movies and TV shows page in the app. Google Play is supported by Chromecast and AirPlay, so you can stream your favorite films and TV shows on a computer monitor or a bigger television screen. You can download your film or television show of choice to save it for later to watch offline. To start downloading, you just have to tap the ‘download’ icon on a movie or TV show. With millions of people using iOS devices across the globe, Google made a wise move in tapping into the market of Apple loyalists. If you want to enjoy the many perks of Google Play on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, install the app now.

The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.   This very long blog post is about developing for mobile, untethered VR and some design considerations and pitfalls to look out for when doing so, before moving onto performance optimisation, testing and Oculus Home store submission. But before getting into all that, let’s look at why you should. There are currently two main strands of VR development — tethered and untethered, or PC-based and mobile-based. PC-based, tethered VR utilises the powerful graphics cards within desktops to run high-end VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Mobile, untethered VR utilises a user’s mobile phone device within a plastic, cardboard or foam VR headset, relying solely upon the processing power offered by that particular model, which will vary wildly from handset to handset. Mobile VR Considerations Mobile VR is currently the cheapest way for consumers and enthusiasts to get into Virtual Reality, with a range of mobile handsets supported and low cost headsets available. Whilst this comes with some issues (more on that later) current and future models of mobile handsets are powerful enough to render convincing VR experiences that are comfortable for most (at a solid 60Hz on Samsung Gear VR). Google Cardboard has shipped over 5m+ units whilst Samsung claim over 1m concurrent users are active within the Gear VR ecosystem at any given time. Headsets range from the cheap Google Cardboard v2 (often free at events) to plastic variations that are a bit more durable, or even foam versions like Merge VR, to Samsung Gear VR and a whole range of other mobile device connected options releasing soon. Whilst having range and options is good, to develop VR you ideally need a clear set of known hardware limitations and capabilities to ensure a solid, smooth, comfortable experience for end users. Therefore will concentrate on the current best of class options, Samsung Gear VR and the Google Daydream VR (releasing later in 2016 but you can start developing now, see my previous blog post about it here). Because of the low cost of entry for end users and consumers, the mobile VR market is rapidly growing with hundreds of new apps becoming available each month. 2016 has seen a real increase in general awareness of VR amongst consumers, buoyed by the launches of Oculus Rift and HTC Vive and imminent release of Sony PlayStation VR in October, along with VR appearing at many public facing events and shows. However being based on Android (although iOS does support Cardboard now and vice versa) it means it is easy to publish titles on the Play Store and already we are seeing lots of cheap, poorly designed VR applications that don’t provide great experiences. Therefore the Gear VR and Daydream marketplaces are (or will be when released) curated for quality control. Whilst this means there are additional barriers to publishing your apps, for end users it helps guarantee a level of quality of experience and overall, will boost VR adoption since comfortable experiences see users return, or what to continue to try others. So in the short term, slightly more of a headache for developers, but in the long term, better for everyone as VR is helped towards mass-market adoption. Limitations There are limitations to mobile VR though, which need to be considered before deciding upon which platform you’re going to support. Firstly, as the name suggests, mobile VR content is driven by mobile devices, not high-end powerful PCs. Whilst newer devices are certainly providing more processing power than ever before, there are still limits to how far and how complex a scene can be rendered in 3D (if you choose to go down that route). However that doesn’t mean it’s ineffective since a 3D generated scene doesn’t have to be photorealistic in order to be convincing or immersive for users. Low poly[gon count] worlds can be just as fun and effective within VR that are far easier to generate on mobile with great performance. Another aspect to consider is despite being untethered, allowing the user freedom of movement without being cabled to a PC, currently it’s not possible to track the position of the headset, meaning that no matter how far the user wanders, their viewpoint will only ever update in a 3 directions. This means that a lot of the full VR experiences they may have tried on tethered VR, where they can lean in and get up, close and personal with characters from any angle, or walk around within a room-scale area, are not possible with mobile VR. However there is hardware being worked on that will allow this eventually. So with less processing power available and no positional head tracking currently possible, it’s understandable why mobile VR excels at and is well supported for 360º photos and video applications. Without any form of real interaction though, if you are just looking around looking at or watching something, there is argument that this isn’t proper VR. Others would also state that with the advances being made with mobile VR and available processing power, developers should target full, high-end VR since the gap will only narrow and whatever you develop today for mobile VR will have a limited shelf-life, as the hardware advances rapidly over the next months and years. Setting Up Development Whilst it’s easier to publish apps on the Google Play Store for Android, and a great place to start if you are happy to release free content, I’ll mostly be focussing on developing for the curated content store offered by Oculus for the Samsung Gear VR, which will also be relevant for the Google Daydream VR ecosystem when it releases later this year. Development environment, SDKs and being an Oculus developer To make a 3D VR app, you need a 3D development environment that supports the necessary Software Development Kits (SDKs) for VR, in this case the Oculus Mobile SDK. The best 3D engine to use for this is Unity, which is available for free or via a paid subscription. The free option has some limitations and requirements of usage but the paid subscription now includes everything you need to publish mobile VR on Android devices (i.e. Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream VR) and iOS (which doesn’t really have a strong VR footing yet although iPhone VR apps are now supported by Google Cardboard) rather than having to pay for them separately, as you did with older versions. Once you have Unity, you need to get the Oculus Mobile SDK for Unity and set yourself up as an Oculus developer. This is a simple registration to create an Oculus ID to log into the website with and start an area where you will eventually submit your app for review before publishing. The Mobile SDK has gone through a number of iterations and is now straight forward to work with, being very well documented. Alongside the Mobile SDK, you’ll also want to get the Audio SDK to make best use of the Oculus positional audio offerings that really add immersion for users to your VR apps. Similarly, this is now robust and well documented. Now you have the Oculus ID setup, you can also join the Oculus forums (and the Unity forums are great too) to find answers to any questions, queries or problems you run into and be part of the wider VR development community. Hardware So that’s the software side; to develop professionally and create great apps, you will need the hardware as well, so you can build, test and run your apps locally before submission to the store. If money isn’t an option, get as many of the supported Samsung mobile handsets you can afford, to test your app on to check performance across the range of devices. If money is tight, aim for the lowest common denominator device, the Samsung S6, to ensure that your app runs on at least the minimum specification mobile handset supported. Having the hardware for testing means you can take your app out on the road too before release and have users test it and give you feedback as well. Usability and user comfort are key elements of VR design and it_is_very_important to make sure your VR apps do not make users feel ill! But this is a subject for another blog post another day… Make sure your mobile device is set to both types of developer mode and allows installation of apps from unknown sources. You can do this by going to first Settings > About device > Build number and tapping Build number seven times to enable developer mode for Android. Then go to Settings > Application Manager, select Gear VR Service, then Manage Storage. Tap on VR Service Version a number of times until the Developer Mode toggle shows up. Slide it over to enable Oculus Gear VR Developer Mode. Finally, you want to enable your device to install and run apps from unknown sources, i.e. for when testing and you aren’t downloading from the Oculus or Google Play Stores. To do this, go to Settings > Security and check the option Unknown sources and OK the warning prompt. Now your mobile device is set to launch apps that are in development that you can side load onto it for testing and demoing. NB. If you can’t see Gear VR Service as an option, make sure you have put the device into a Gear VR headset previously to start the installation and setup process of the Oculus Gear VR software, drivers and home app — yes this means you need to buy one! One final element of hardware to software link is getting the OSIG of the Samsung mobile handset to insert into your test builds so that it runs on the Oculus Gear VR system without being a verified app. To do this you will first need to download a Device ID app from the Google Play Store, then run it to get that specific handsets Device ID. Once you have that, go to the Oculus OSIG generator website and enter the Device ID to get your unique OSIG file. Once downloaded, insert into your app package within Unity to allow the built apps to run on your device. That’s the software and the hardware, what to design and develop? Of course, not every app you develop has to be released or destined for public consumption so it’s a good idea, especially with VR, to create a series of prototypes and simple ideas first before committing to the full development effort of a polished experience app. Google spent some time making loads of interaction prototypes for Daydream VR that were simple and effective in helping developers understand the possibilities of what would be possible with the new hardware and input controller. If you’re starting out in VR dev, you will need to do this as well so you understand what does and importantly, doesn’t work in VR, then again to understand the current limitations of mobile VR. If your app performs poorly or is uncomfortable to use, it will not get past submission. Keep it simple Simple ideas and simple interactions work best for mobile VR because of the limited input options available. Yes, bluetooth Android controllers are available and supported by Samsung Gear VR, and the Google Daydream VR ecosystem states that a device must come with the controller to be compliant, but the majority of users presently do not own bluetooth gamepads. Therefore if you design an app (typically a game) that has only works with a bluetooth gamepad, rather than the built-in touchpad on the side of the headset, you will be dramatically reducing the potential market size of your buying audience. The touchpad on the side of the Gear VR (v1 retail edition) is bumpy to make it feel like a gamepad D-pad, so reduces the ease of diagonal swipes and interactions but makes it clearer for new VR users where to swipe forwards, backwards, up, down with a nubbin in the centre to mark a button tap area. The newly announced Gear VR 2, available to pre-order for release later in the year, has reverted back to the flat touchpad that the early Innovator Editions had. This is a good design decision since you can have more complex movements tracked from users fingers. The main downside of the touchpad on the side of the device is that new VR users tend to get headset grabby, holding the headset with their hands as they get used to the sensation of having their senses taken over by VR. This often results in user accidentally quitting or pausing the app, depending how it’s designed to operate, adding to the confusion and makes it tricky if demoing to people as unlike tethered full VR, you can’t see what they’re seeing without the app being mirrored to a display somewhere. Baring in mind most people who try your app could be new to VR, it could be the first VR experience they’ve ever tried, simple input makes it a lot easier for them to accept and adapt to the technology, which can be overwhelming for some in it’s own right. Thankfully as VR adoption is becoming more widespread and more and more people have access to VR, having to keep this fact in mind will reduce over time and hopefully next year, we won’t have to worry about it so much. Rock solid performance In order to pass submission and to make a comfortable experience for users, your app will have to run at a rock, solid 60 frames-per-second (fps) on the Samsung Gear VR. This is necessary as it has been deemed the lowest comfortable framerate for comfortable VR experiences by most users. Any frame drops, even for the briefest instant, can cause users to feel ill as the virtual world is stuttering and jittering, struggling to keep up with their head movements. This can be quite a challenge if you are unused to 3D engine optimisation or geometry simplification. You will only have about 50,000 polys (100,000 tops) to play with at any given frame within your VR scene, so you are going to have to be clever and think about the style and look overall and implement Unity tricks to get it looking the best whilst remaining stable. Thankfully the latest version of Unity 5.4 now supports single pass rendering so you can achieve the same result with less effort required by the hardware, with the VR elements being taken care of by the engine rather than drawing everything twice, albeit slightly different to encompass each eye viewpoint, to achieve the 3D depth effect necessary. Also thanks to John Carmack, original creator of DOOM, is now at Oculus and spends most of his time focused on mobile VR development and tools. As a result, Gear VR has long supported asynchronous timewarp, a technique employed by the SDK to smooth out frame drops and allow developers to get away with the occasional jitter on mobile hardware. But this does not mean you should use it as a crutch and think that you do not need to optimise your codebase! It has limitations and won’t always save you or your users. Oculus states the following targets to aim for, when it comes to limitations to bare in mind when developing for mobile VR with the Gear VR headset: 50–100 draw calls per frame 50,000–100,000 polygons per frame As fewer textures as possible (but they can be large) 1–3 ms in script execution Throttle the CPU and GPU effectively to control heat, battery usage and scene performance NB. All other Android APIs and SDKs (such as Google Cardboard) do not give you access usually to direct control over the CPU and GPU in the mobile device, this is something only Oculus does with specific Samsung devices through their partnership in creating the Gear VR and mobile SDKs. General Best Practice & Design Considerations Now it’s time to look at a series of useful tips and tricks centred around general best practice and VR design, to ensure you are providing a great VR experience for new and expert users alike. General Guidelines The VR marketplace is still fairly small, although it is now possible to sell upwards of 100,000 copies of a VR game app on the Oculus Gear VR store if popular. Don’t expect to become a millionaire overnight, this isn’t Angry Birds level of adoption, yet. The VR developer community is open and welcoming, friendly and helpful. If you get stuck, there are many forums for Unity, Oculus, Gear VR and Android, as well as VR community Slack channels to join. Find a local VR meetup in your area and attend to meet with other VR developers and discuss your findings or problems. Don’t be afraid of the Unity 5 VR tutorials, there are some great, simple and easy to understand examples of VR design from objects, understanding scale, performance, interaction types and pretty much everything else you need to understand of the basics of VR development. Similarly, the Oculus guidelines for VR design and usage of the mobile and audio SDKs are invaluable resources of information, tips and detailed code samples for great VR performance and optimisation. You will need all target hardware available for development and testing before app submission, or at the very least, the baseline minimum specification model, i.e. the Samsung Galaxy S6. (Technically some models of the Gear VR support the Samsung Note 4 mobile handset device but only advanced app developers should look to build and support this with their apps as it takes a lot of performance optimisation in order to maintain stable 60 frames per second in VR with this particular hardware chipsets.) VR Design Consider length of play time for new-to-VR users; design around keeping it to shorter play periods (15 min periods) and comfortable. Length of gameplay segments can also help users look after potential battery drain and overheating of their mobile device, allowing them to recharge and cool off if necessary without fear of losing progress in-game. If you’re going to make a horror title, clearly label it as so, especially when user testing, so that users can choose whether to continue with it or not. VR immersion feels very real and sudden surprises and shocks have a much more profound effect on users. A scale of interaction, offering initially simple controls allows newbies to enjoy the experience without being overwhelmed by figuring out what to do; they are already pretty overwhelmed by their first VR experience. Advanced or additional controls that can be unlocked later through design, progress within the experience allows a user to feel powerful and skilled as they master the finer controls. The scene should respond to user head movement at all times, even in menus and cut-scenes to ensure the user has a comfortable experience. Similarly, do not take control of the user’s viewpoint and move their head for them, this is incredibly uncomfortable to experience. Depending upon your app theme, avoid moving a user through the environment unless it is at a constant smooth velocity without acceleration or deceleration. If you have to move the user, place them in a cockpit of some description if possible to ground them and give them something in to foreground to focus on. Avoid changing user perspective. Do not pull the camera from first-person to third as the user will feel like the world has been dragged from beneath them. Allow users to adjust the comfort level if possible so that those prone to motion sickness can enable features designed to reduce discomfort, whereas more advanced users can disable them. Features that help reduce discomfort include: Stepped-turning of user avatar Look and teleport fade to a new location for movement Tunnelling to darken and fade out the peripheral visual data when turning User Interface Remember you are developing a stereoscopic app! Everything has to be rendered twice and to maintain immersion, should be embedded within the 3D world rather than floating over the top as would a traditional UI. If you have to use traditional UI then project onto a surface rather than directly onto the screen, so that it has a sense of depth within the environment. Typically, setting it to appear 1–3m from the user is considered most comfortable. Where possible, design UI into a logical, fitting 3D object within the world, i.e. onto a book, a scroll, a mobile phone or wrist display, so that the user is able to interact with it naturally. Design your UI layout so that it fits naturally within a comfortable viewing area of the user’s vision, so that they do not have to move their head around a great deal to see all the menu options or to navigate; they can move their head to select items but straining to see items to their far left or right causes neck strain. As mentioned previously, input is typically limited to the touchpad interactions as most owners will not have a bluetooth gamepad available with buttons to select menu items. Therefore you will have to consider alternative input mechanisms that utilise the nature of VR offered. Gaze interactions are commonplace with mobile VR apps, where a virtual cursor is shown that follows the movements of the user’s head position. When enabled, the user just has to look at a menu item to interact with it. Typically there will be a radial progress bar that will fill up after a period of time where the user remains focused on one item, that will then be selected. Whilst gaze interactions are easy to use, consider adding a tap to select override for advanced or impatient users since multi-layer UI menus can be tiresome and slow to navigate using gaze progress wait and fill option only. If your UI appears over the application running, make it clear to the user that they are in the menus and not in the world. Depending upon purpose, you may want to pause the action when showing a menu, or at the very least adjust the lighting and focus to be on the menu. Having a static icon in one corner that follows the user’s head movements provides a constant reminder they are in the menus if they were to look further to the left, right or behind them and lose sight of the panel. Even better, have the whole menu follow their head movements so they can never lose sight of it. Use the physical [BACK] button on the Gear VR headset to allow users to navigate back up a level if you have multi-layer menus, or even front-to-back swipes on the touchpad, although this can get confusing if you have a library menu design where they can scroll through a lot of content cells i.e. a photo or video catalogue. Performance Optimisation & Testing If you have already read to this point, where we have looked at considerations as to why you should design mobile VR apps for Samsung Gear VR (& to a degree prepare for Google Daydream VR), how to get your development environment setup and general VR design considerations, and you’re still here, then you must be pretty interested! Therefore it is assumed from this point onwards that you have at least a basic knowledge and understanding of 3D asset creation and app development, since I’m switching to a more specific set of technical terminology in order to relate to key aspects of design and development appropriately. You have been warned… Performance Optimisation Optimising the performance of your mobile VR app is key, since it ensures that the user has a comfortable experience (horror titles aside) and it passes the submission review as part of the curated store process. There are a couple of areas to performance; overall app performance, 3D optimisation and battery lifetime. These all play a part to ensure that users can enjoy your app for as long as possible, give great reviews and tell their friends and associates about it to help spread the word. Optimise for 60 frames per second. You can not drop a frame, although Asynchronous TimeWarp will hide and smooth some more complex scenes but do not rely upon it. Don’t rely on the frame rate counter in the Unity editor since it is doing everything twice when you play a scene on your computer. Whilst it can give you a good indication of where your performance levels are at, build out and test on the target hardware to ensure smooth experiences. Users often can’t tell beyond around a virtual distance of 20m whether the image or scene they are looking at is stereoscopic or monoscopic. Use this to your advantage to swap out skyboxes for far off environments to save rendering load on a mobile device. Use the tools built into Unity to help you: The Profiler and Frame Debugger. These will show you were your app is lagging or overloading a scene, allowing you to go through frame by frame to examine how the scene is constructed by stepping through the draw calls. You will likely find objects you don’t need to render, reducing your overall draw call amount. Furthermore, batch your draw calls wherever possible using the UnityStatic Batching and Dynamic Batching tools built into the editor. Cull the faces from your 3D models geometry that will never be seen to remove wasteful polys. Similarly, use occlusion culling to ensure you are not rendering things that cannot be seen yet, i.e. the geometry of a room beyond a door that hasn’t been opened yet. Simplify your 3D meshes as much as possible to ensure you have the lowest level of detail for objects without losing finer information. Reduce overdraw as much as possible to ensure fewer objects are drawn over the top of one another. The Unity Scene View Control Bar will give you a understanding of what can be optimised. Whilst there, use lightmapping to bake your shadows onto objects and scenes rather than using expensive dynamic shadows. Beyond skyboxes, if you have to render an object in 3D in the distance then use lower levels of detail (LOD) in your model with fewer triangles and swap out to higher LOD models as they get closer to the users viewpoint. Make sure CPU and GPU throttling is enabled since failing to initialise these values will result in your app running in a downwards clocked environment by default. Gear VR apps are typically CPU bound so favouring this over the GPU will often get the best performance. However if your app is optimised well, you might be able to downclock both the CPU and GPU increasing battery life and therefore session playtime. Testing The key to a great app is to test regularly and iterate upon after each session, including relevant suggestions and improvements to user flow, interface, process and design as you go, rather than storing all the effort up until the last minute when you think it is 100% done. This way, you will be able to make continuous small adjustments that will overall require less effort than suddenly discovering a major flaw in your design not apparent to you until too late, requiring a huge amount of effort to rework and fix. As a developer you will be too close and involved with the app to see the issues and bugs, so user testing early on and throughout the development process is critical to ensure you aren’t missing something obvious that a first-time user can spot straight away. However there are still a number of tests that you can and should carry out yourself before unleashing it upon others. The main types of testing you will be carrying out are functionality and performance related, to ensure that it operates as it should do, at a basic level, in a means that will make for comfortable usage by users. You could write unit tests for aspects of functionality but sometimes you’re just going to have to carry out manual testing and spot any issues yourself. If you have decided to manage the development process using Agile methodology, then you can create a series of test cases from your epics and user stories to ensure that the app functions and includes the features as intended. Otherwise you will need to think of a series of test cases that effectively test and capture all possible conditions and uses, not just for the expected behaviour and user journey but also what a user could do to disrupt this and potentially end up in a locked state, i.e. not accepting a checkbox or not meeting the score to progress to the next level without an option to try again. Testing VR for functionality is harder than testing a normal flat app since you are best running it on the device in the VR headset, but this means you cannot quickly switch over to a spreadsheet or notepad to detail issues you spot. So testing in pairs is recommended so one can interact and carry out the tests whilst the other is annotating issues verbally described. Before you get to this stage though, you can run the app directly in the Unity Editor to check functionality and performance without having to make a build and deploy to a mobile device. As referenced above in the performance optimisation section, the Unity Profiler, Frame Debugger and Scene Viewer will provide a good starting point to test for performance, as well as in the Editor itself throwing up any edge case exceptions and code errors. User Testing User testing requires more preparation and time to get right to ensure you are getting valid feedback about your app and not the technology. As mentioned in an earlier blog post, roughly 9 out of 10 people still haven’t tried VR before and so, using them as fresh test subjects, whilst necessary, needs management to make them useful to you. When arranging a user testing session, have each tester carry out a period of VR familiarisation and acclimatisation before asking them to try out and test your app. If they are new to VR, then this will give them a chance to be wowed by the technology and the experience of being immersed in another world without that excitement affecting the usefulness of their feedback specifically about your VR app. Once they are aware of what VR can do and how it works at a basic level, they will be ready to test your app with a clearer understanding of how it should work, feel and sensations provided. Some good examples of familiarisation apps on Gear VR are the Samsung Introduction to Virtual Reality (free) and Welcome to Virtual Reality by SliceVR (paid). Prepare a set of questions to ask them after their test session with your app to gather useful feedback and information about how they felt, how easy they understood what to do, where they struggled or got stuck, or aspects that made them feel uncomfortable (from a performance perspective not a content, scary horror angle). Remember, it’s harder to mirror the content shown on a mobile VR device and so you likely won’t be able to see in real time what they are looking at (and likely pointing at in thin air). Have a set of printouts with you with key screens and menus on from your app so after their test session, they can refer to them and help them describe certain screens or panels that they’ve seen and are highlighting but may not necessarily know or use the same names as you do for them. If you have the budget available, there are companies now offering VR testing services to take some of the time effort and strain off you. Testronic Labs now offer a paired VR testing service for functionality and compatibility, whereas Player Research are leaders in user research and user testing, both creating and providing comprehensive reports post-test for you to take on-board as part of the service. So by now, your app should be running smoothly at a solid 60 frames and is bug free (as ever a piece of software can be), has been tested and verified comfortable and easy-to-use by a range of intended end users. Therefore it’s time to submit your app to the Oculus Store and get ready for launch! Store Submission Store Submission Process In order to be able to sell your app on the Oculus Store for Gear VR titles, you will need to have the app reviewed by the Oculus Store team for comfort, performance and general suitability before they will give the green light for it to be released. This is a relatively straight-forward process but does require a bit of legwork on your behalf to get everything setup in the backend first. The amount of effort required to setup your app depends upon the features included with your app i.e. whether or not you have IAP, matchmaking for multiplayer, achievements, leaderboards and so on. Many elements you will have to setup APIs and IDs for in the backend, then go back into your app project in Unity to ensure that the appropriate values are used for each achievement unlock, IAP etc. You should have already setup an Oculus ID, as covered in part 2 of this blog series, but if not, it’s quick to do over on oculus.com. Under ‘Developers > Dashboard’ you’ll need to ‘Create new organisation’ before you can create an app profile. Ensure that all the important information is correct for your organisation, such as address, financial banking information so that you can receive hardware but crucially, monthly revenue payments for your app once it’s on sale. Basics Once you have setup your organisation you can then setup your app, by going to ‘My Apps > Create New App’ and start to enter the information. IMPORTANT! Currently, there is no way to delete an app entry as a whole once you have created it so ensure all details are correct at time of creation — you can go back and edit app information at any time but if you like a clean dashboard like me, get it right first time! The first stage is to select the platform — we’re submitting a mobile VR app so select ‘Gear VR’ and enter the full app name to create the initial entry. Once you have the initial app profile created with name and platform, Oculus will generate you a unique app ID which you will need to use within your Unity project to initialise any Oculus APIs, especially those that relate to IAP or licence ownership checks for the final version. Similarly, once you have setup financial information, you can then create any IAP tokens and IDs to then call from the Unity project for each appropriate action via ‘Edit Details > Platform > IAP’. App Store Info The main information that will appear on the Oculus Store for your app is under ‘Edit Details > Submission Info’. Here you will enter the full and short description, set the genre, features, peripherals supported, any age ratings and price. Some of these elements are up to you, some like age rating might need an external body to review, or as with price, the Oculus Store team to work with you to agree on a value that is deemed appropriate. Be aware that all apps are set to ‘Free’ by default so if you want to charge for it, be sure to change this before submission! One time consuming element, as with any store submission, is the art assets you need to create and provide to go along with the listing. There are a few different shapes and sizes of images required, depending upon where and how the listing will be displayed within the store but the guidelines are easy to follow with advice of where to place the logo, or not, to ensure dynamic banners for sales etc don’t cover it when enabled. One cool asset that you can provide for Gear VR titles (that isn’t yet supported for Rift titles) is a cube map image, so potential customers can view a still from your title in 360º on their Gear VR whilst in the store listing. Builds Of course, information is all very well but you need to upload a build to be reviewed and ultimately, available for download post-purchase. It is wise to run the Oculus Submission Validator tool against your app APK file before you submit and ensure you have done the following: Set the XML manifest file and install location correctly — Gear VR apps have to be set to install on the device not external storage. A version code set — typically if this is your first submission, 1.0 or incremented if uploading a new build post-review from a previous submission A signed APK so that once reviewed and confirmed ready for release, it can go live without further uploads necessary. The build management section allows you to upload builds to a variety of different channels: Alpha, Beta, Release Candidate and Live. Note that a number of journalists have access to the Release Candidate channel and so, if you haven’t done any PR or marketing around your app before launch, be prepared for them to potentially stumble across it and release a preview article without warning. So it’s best to reach out before setting a build to this channel, so that you can preempt any issues if it’s not 100% ready for release yet! Ready to Submit Once you think you have everything entered, you can submit the information via ‘Submission Info > Submit’ where a handy checklist is shown with current status of each section needed. Once you have a nice row of green ticks, you have a final chance to review the full listing and details below before clicking that [SUBMIT FOR REVIEW] button. Once submitted, the Oculus Store Gear VR team will review your app information, play test it and get back in touch with any suggested amends before it will be confirmed ready for release. THAT’S IT! You’ve reached the end — well done and good luck with mobile VR development, be sure to share apps you create below in the comments.

Matthew Dunnnews.com.au@mattydunn11 Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend HOPE you didn’t have to send any important emails this morning because you could be one of the millions of people affected by a global Gmail outage. At 1:16am AEST, Google posted a service disruption notice advising it was investigating reports of an issue. “The users are redirected to a page with ‘Service not available, contact your administrator’,” Google wrote on its Apps Status Dashboard. Gmail is currently experiencing a service-wide outage. Please stay tuned for updates or follow here: https://t.co/2SGW3X1cQn.— Google for Work (@GoogleforWork) September 14, 2016 Another update came at 1:58am when Google advised it had “identified the root cause of the issue” and a potential fix was being implemented. Two more updates at 2:40am and 4:10am claimed Gmail had been restored for some users, with a full fix expected not soon after. The latest update was posted at 5:40am, which reiterated the previous two posts. “Gmail service has already been restored for some users, and we expect a resolution for all users in the near future. Please note this time frame is an estimate and may change,” it wrote. “Delivery of messages sent to affected users during the issue may be delayed.” Despite claiming many services had been restored, social media has been lit with people complaining of the outage.

The European Union today proposed new copyright rules that would require Youtube, Dailymotion and other websites to receive permission before publishing any copyrighted content their users upload. The EU wants websites to use technology that can automatically identify whether or not the owners of an audio or video clip have authorized their work to be uploaded. In a statement, EU commissioner Günther Oettinger said that the proposed rules would "ensure that more content will be available." "Europe's creative content should not be locked-up, but it should also be highly protected, in particular to improve the remuneration possibilities for our creators," he said. But Google, which owns YouTube, criticized the proposal, suggesting in a blog post that it would "turn the Internet into a place where everything uploaded to the web must be cleared by lawyers before it can find an audience." Google noted that it already has technology in place that can detect copyrighted content uploaded to Youtube, but that making such detection mandatory would be impractical. //Related Articles Google Yanks Content From German Publishers in Search Spat "Platforms are not obliged proactively to monitor what users upload—but must act when notified of an infringement," Google said. "Through Content ID, YouTube blocks or monetizes content that has been claimed by a copyright owner according to their instructions. This is an important distinction, without which many hosting services simply could not exist." The EU proposal also modifies copyright protection laws to allow publishers to require that websites linking to their content pay a fee. It's intended to help publishers boost the revenue from the stories they post online, which the EU says is "essential for citizens' access to knowledge in our democratic societies." Critics of this "snippet tax" include the Mozilla Foundation, which said it would "limit the free flow of knowledge, cripple competition, and hinder start-ups and small- and medium-sized businesses."

Calling all budding artists: Google needs your help! The Web giant on Wednesday kicked off its annual Doodle 4 Google art contest, inviting K-12 students across the US, Guam, and Puerto Rick to create their own version of the Google logo. The winning masterpiece will be showcased on the Google homepage for a day, ensuring that millions of people will see it. The winner will also receive $30,000 towards a college scholarship, and the opportunity to work with the Google Doodle team in Mountain View, Calif. Plus, the winning kid's school will get to spend $50,000 on technology. The theme of this year's competition is "what I see for the future," and Google is asking kids to "imagine what awaits them in the years to come and represent that vision" in their doodle. Kids can use any materials to bring their vision to life—crayons, clay, graphic design, even food—just be sure to incorporate the letters G-o-o-g-l-e in your doodle. "Yes, that means anything they see—even if it includes flying dogs, living on a shooting star, the trip of their dreams, or for the true Futurists out there—perhaps a distant world filled with dazzling new technology of all shapes and sizes," Google Doodle Team Lead Ryan Germick wrote in a blog post. Submissions are open now through Dec. 2; head here to enter a doodle. Once the entry period closes, Google's judges (who have yet to be named) will narrow the field to the 53 best doodles, then the public will be invited to vote for their favorite online. "This year's contest is going to be one for the record books; the future and the ways to depict it are limitless," Germick wrote. Google has been hosting this contest every year since 2008. During the 2015-16 contest, a sophomore from Washington D.C. named Akilah Johnson took home the top prize. Her winning doodle is pictured above.

Evernote Corp. said it plans to move its entire IT infrastructure to Google Cloud Platform by the end of this year. The popular web-based app for storing and synchronizing files across devices is the latest to brush off concerns about cloud lock-in, as it embraces Google's higher-level resources to expand its own offerings. Evernote's assets are located in two data centers, which house a combined 3.2 PB of data between its 200 million users' notes and attachments. The company's aggressive migration plan ultimately calls for putting its entire data footprint on Google Cloud Platform by the end of 2016. Two primary categories drove Evernote's interest in Google, according to Anirban Kundu, Evernote's CTO: the infrastructure components for storage, pub/sub and queuing mechanisms; and Google Machine Learning tools for language processing -- in particular, Natural Language API and Translate API. The initial migration won't involve rearchitecting, but that is planned for the early part of 2017 to utilize the higher-level services. Evernote plans to build a level of abstraction for data storage, but it acknowledged that's not really possible with services such as Machine Learning, and that's OK, Kundu said. "The problems you run into are the APIs are not homogenous congruent in any form, and that means we'd have to write for multiple cloud providers, which defeats the speed and the agility of why we did this in the first place," Kundu said. Evernote's decision wasn't based solely on bottom-tier compute or networking resources, for which it could have spread resources across multiple providers. The company did look at other cloud providers, though it didn't specifically cite which ones. It's yet another example of how deals in the public cloud are less about cheap servers and more about finding the most innovative services to improve products and gain customers. "It's about value -- the added value of leveraging Google's machine learning services to improve the product," said Dave Bartoletti, principal analyst with Forrester Research.  "This is what will drive the next wave of cloud adoption -- the search to provide a reason for companies to move operations to a cloud platform beyond cheaper servers or storage." The cloud lock-in boogeyman Avoiding lock-in is a common concern among IT customers and vendors -- but some say that's a blanket characterization, with overly negative connotations. There are punitive or predatory types of lock-in, where contracts are written to make it hard to do anything else, or with some kind of penalty for leaving, said Andrew Reichman, research director with 451 Research. But there is also a lock-in with positive benefits -- where users go deep with a service, cloud or otherwise, because it offers something unique or fits well with staff skills and isn't worth the effort to migrate away from, Reichman said. In those instances, over-prioritizing concerns about cloud lock-in can be shortsighted. "If the solution isn't a commodity, if it's not the same as everyone else's, then there's some amount of lock-in," Reichman said. "That doesn't have to be a bad thing -- you choose the solution you think is best, and you don't limit it and say you're only going to use some of it." Of course, not every company is so eager to move all its assets to one platform, especially those that aren't born in the cloud. Some large enterprises continue to pursue OpenStack as a means to avoid cloud lock-in. Others hedge bets by spreading resources across providers, or have different business units building applications across the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. Another notable example is Dropbox, which earlier this year said it moved more than 90% of its data off AWS and onto custom-built infrastructure. There are scenarios where public cloud becomes more expensive and less advantageous than building tailored infrastructure, but that typically involves a certain level of scale. Dropbox, for example, handles more than 500 PB of data, compared to Evernote's 3.2 PB. "We didn't see any tremendous benefit in terms of innovation or speed to deployment in us managing the infrastructure," Kundu said. Google and Evernote already partner through Google Drive, though that relationship had nothing to do with selecting which public cloud it moved to, Kundu said. He also downplayed the importance of price, saying the highest priorities were security and reliability, as well as the accuracy with those higher-level services. For Google, another enterprise IT feather The deal also represents another win for Google as it tries to catch AWS and Azure and prove it's capable of handling enterprise workloads. In the past year, prominent companies, such as Disney and Coca-Cola, have disclosed their use of the platform for certain projects, while other popular web-based companies, such as Spotify, have said they plan to move the majority of their workloads on Google Cloud Platform. Software companies such as Evernote are akin to the types of customers AWS was highlighting several years ago, but Google still has some work to do to get those larger enterprises onboard, Reichman said. Building that portfolio of customers is a slow process, but it's these types of moves that will continue to build momentum, he added. "References are really powerful," he said. "Buyers want to feel like they're not the first one using it." Trevor Jones is a news writer with TechTarget's data center and virtualization media group. Contact him at tjones@techtarget.com.

Oldest  Newest  [-] Trevor Jones - 14 Sep 2016 12:26 PM How do you weigh concerns about lock-in against the value of higher-level services available on public clouds? Add My Comment Cancel   [-] mcorum - 16 Sep 2016 10:02 AM It’s a fairly straight-forward decision on the surface - does the value of the services provided outweigh the costs associate with lock-in. If you’re thinking cloud, then you’re already thinking about value and cost (or at least you should be), so it’s just another variable in the equation. Add My Comment Cancel   [-] mcorum - 16 Sep 2016 9:59 AM It’s good to see someone emphasize value over lock-in. Lock-in is going to be there, no matter who you go with, so you can’t let the fear of lock-in paralyze the organization.

Violent winds of up to 370 kilometres per hour and torrential rain brought parts of eastern and southern Taiwan to a standstill as Meranti skirted past the island’s southern tip, where Hengchun’s observation station recorded the strongest gusts in its 120-year history, according to Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau. Meranti made landfall in China early Thursday near Xiamen in Fujian Province, with gusts of up to 280km/h, according to CNN meteorologists. Heavy rainfall, flash flooding and dangerous winds will continue for the next 48 hours, with possible mudslides in eastern China. Meranti has been downgraded from a super typhoon to typhoon status — the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said late Wednesday. — AP Read the full story here. media_cameraTyphoon Meranti lashed Taiwan with its biggest storm in 21 years last night. 9.30am Di Natale slams Hanson’s maiden speech Greens leader Richard Di Natale has this morning addressed Pauline Hanson’s maiden speech, slamming it as ‘overtly racist’, ‘bigoted’ and ‘divisive’. “She’s been elected as a member of parliament, she’s got a platform, but that doesn’t mean we have to stay and listen to that garbage,” he told Sky News.

Credit: Caltech Engineers from Caltech have developed a method that uses data from satellite and street-level images, such as the ones that you can see in Google maps, to create automatically an inventory of street trees that cities may use to better manage urban forests. Their work is described in the proceedings of the 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, which was held in Las Vegas this summer. “Cities have been surveying their tree populations for decades, but the process is very labor intensive. It usually involves hiring arborists to go out with GPS units to mark the location of each individual tree and identify its species,” says senior author Pietro Perona, the Allen E. Puckett Professor of Electrical Engineering in the Division of Engineering and Applied Science. “For this reason, tree surveys are usually only done every 20 to 30 years, and a lot can change in that time.” Perona and his team are not expert arborists. Rather, they are leaders in the field of computer vision: they specialize in creating visual recognition algorithms—computer programs capable of “learning” to recognize objects in images—that can see and understand images much like a human would. These algorithms, by replicating the abilities of experts, can sometimes even understand images better than the average person. As part of an ongoing project called “Visipedia,” a collaboration with Serge Belongie (BS ’95) of the Joan & Irwin Jacobs Technion–Cornell Institute and Cornell University and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the engineers have developed algorithms that can recognize the species of a North American bird from a single picture (http://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/photo-id/). The team eventually hopes to develop Visipedia’s capabilities until it can accurately recognize nearly all living things. But they were inspired to turn their attention toward trees when Perona noticed the effects of the years-long California drought on the trees near the Caltech campus in Pasadena. “I happened to notice that many people in Pasadena were putting drought-resistant plants in their yards to save water, but when they took out the lawns and stopped watering, many trees started dying, and that seemed like a shame,” Perona says. “I realized that computer vision might be able to help. By analyzing automatically satellite and street-level images that are routinely collected, maybe we could carry out an inventory of all the trees and we could see over time how Pasadena is changing, whether the trees that are dying are just a few birch trees, which are not native to California and require frequent watering, or whether it’s truly a massive change.” To begin their survey of the Pasadena urban tree population, the team developed a method to automatically “look” at any specific location in the city using aerial and street-level images from Google Maps (Google agreed to let Caltech use the images for research free of charge). They then created an algorithm that detects objects within these images and calculates their geographic location. Although a human could easily look at these photographs, spot an object, and ascertain whether or not that object is a tree, the task is not so simple for a computer. Perona’s research group uses artificial neural networks—algorithms inspired by the brain that allow a computer to “learn” to recognize objects in images. These networks must first receive training from humans. “We train an algorithm the way you would teach a child—by showing it lots of examples,” Perona says. “The more examples of trees the algorithm sees, the better it becomes at detecting trees. I must say that a child would learn rather more quickly than our algorithms—right now we need hundreds of examples for each type of tree.” To provide those examples, the team enlisted some human help via a crowdsourcing service called Amazon Mechanical Turk, in which hundreds of workers worldwide can be quickly recruited to complete simple tasks that require human intelligence. In this case, the so-called “turkers” were asked to look at aerial and street-level images of Pasadena and label the trees in each photo. This information was used to train the algorithm to determine which objects were trees. The engineers next wanted to train the algorithm to identify the species of each tree in the photos—something that the average person cannot do. Fortuitously, the city of Pasadena had partnered in 2013 with a commercial tree management company called Davey Resource Group (DRG) to complete a tree inventory. The survey included species identification, measurements, and the geographical locations of each of the approximately 80,000 trees in the city. Using this information, the engineers trained the algorithm to identify 18 of the more than 200 species of trees in Pasadena. From Google Maps aerial and street view images, the engineers obtained four different photographs of each tree in Pasadena, taken from different viewpoints and at different distances from the tree. These photos were then analyzed by the algorithm’s “brain”—the artificial neural network. The network then produced a list of a few possible tree species and a score of the certainty of each guess. After comparing the algorithm’s results with those of the 2013 tree survey, the engineers found that their algorithm could detect and identify a tree’s species from Google Maps images with about 80 percent accuracy. “This was much better than we had expected, and it showed that our method can produce similar results to a tree survey done by humans,” says Steve Branson, a postdoctoral scholar in electrical engineering and coauthor on the paper. “A human tree expert can identify species at a higher accuracy than our algorithm, but when these large city tree surveys are done they can’t be 100 percent accurate either. You need lots of people to spread out around the city and there will be mistakes.” Eventually, cities could use Perona’s computer vision software as part of a long-term technological solution for the management of urban forests. The idea is that the software would continuously collect data about urban street trees from satellite and street level images, which are updated every few months, or from other public images. That information then could be incorporated into software that would help the city understand how its urban forests are evolving, and help in the creation of long-term plans for future street-tree investments. Although perfecting the algorithm is an ongoing process, Perona says the concept could eventually change the way urban forests are managed. The study involving Pasadena street trees was published in a paper titled, “Cataloging Public Objects Using Aerial and Street-Level Images—Urban Trees.” Results may be browsed on-line at http://vision.caltech.edu/registree/. In addition to Perona and Branson, other coauthors include David Hall from Caltech and Jan Wegner and Konrad Schindler from ETH Zurich.

Years in the making, Inbox is by the same people who brought you Gmail, but it?s not Gmail: it?s a completely different type of inbox, built to fit your life. Courtesy: Youtube/Google October 23rd 2014 2 years ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Google introduces its all new 'Inbox' Online Google’s Gmail suffers global outage, millions of users affected Matthew Dunn, news.com.auSeptember 15, 2016 8:30am HOPE you didn’t have to send any important emails this morning because you could be one of the millions of people affected by a global Gmail outage. At 1:16am AEST, Google posted a service disruption notice advising it was investigating reports of an issue. “The users are redirected to a page with ‘Service not available, contact your administrator’,” Google wrote on its Apps Status Dashboard. Gmail is currently experiencing a service-wide outage. Please stay tuned for updates or follow here: https://t.co/2SGW3X1cQn.— Google for Work (@GoogleforWork) September 14, 2016 Another update came at 1:58am when Google advised it had “identified the root cause of the issue” and a potential fix was being implemented. Two more updates at 2:40am and 4:10am claimed Gmail had been restored for some users, with a full fix expected not soon after. The latest update was posted at 5:40am, which reiterated the previous two posts. “Gmail service has already been restored for some users, and we expect a resolution for all users in the near future. Please note this time frame is an estimate and may change,” it wrote. “Delivery of messages sent to affected users during the issue may be delayed.” Despite claiming many services had been restored, social media has been lit with people complaining of the outage.

The legislation — Senate bills 995 and 997 — allow for the regulation and research of self-driving technology within the state. Both bills passed the Senate unanimously as part of a four-bill package Sept. 7 and were presented to the House of Representatives in a hearing Tuesday. Michigan’s debate is being watched closely by the auto industry and Silicon Valley because of its possible future influence on similar laws that could be considered by other states. Longtime auto executive John Krafcik, who heads Google’s car project, wrote in a letter to state Rep. Bradford Jacobsen, chairman of the House Communications and Technology Committee, that language in the legislation could exclude non-automakers from deploying their technology in the state. Under the current legislation, only a “motor vehicle manufacturer” — an entity that has “manufactured and distributed” vehicles in the U.S. — can operate an autonomous ride-hailing network in the state. It also requires that autonomous vehicle fleets must be “supplied or controlled by a motor vehicle manufacturer,” which could potentially bar companies that aren’t automakers from operating other manufacturers’ vehicles retrofitted with their technology. Google and other technology companies may not be subject to the protections of these bills because they don’t sell cars to consumers, Krafcik wrote. “While the current bill coming out of the Senate may be suitable for traditional motor vehicle manufacturers, we are concerned that ambiguities [in the bills] could be read to exclude other innovated [autonomous vehicle] technology,” the letter read. Krafcik also suggested revisions to the bills, including deleting the distribution requirement in the definition of a vehicle manufacturer and adding manufacturers of autonomous technology to entities permitted to deploy automated vehicle fleets. Jacobsen did not respond to Automotive News’ request to comment, however, Michigan Sen. Mike Kowall told The Detroit News that the Legislature is evaluating Google’s revisions and will release an update in time for an hearing expected to take place next week. Should the Legislature take no action on Google’s concerns, the company may have to work with automakers to get its driving systems on Michigan roads. In May, Google partnered with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to manufacture 100 fully autonomous Pacificas.

The Google-owned video giant is working with some 100 creators, who over the next several weeks will produce terror-inducing VR videos for their YouTube channels in a partnership with Jason Blum’s Blumhouse Productions, the studio behind genre films including “The Purge,” “Ouija,” “Insidious” and “Paranormal Activity.” YouTubers including Markiplier, PrankVsPrank, Furious Pete, Vitalyzdtv and KrazyRayRay will be part of the scare-fest. The videos are slated to go live between Oct. 20 and Halloween, on the YouTube Spaces page and on the channels of the participating creators. The videos will be shot using Google’s Jump camera rigs at YouTube Spaces in Los Angeles, London, Tokyo, Berlin, Toronto and New York. Additionally, creators from YouTube Spaces in Paris and Sao Paulo will send select creators to shoot at YouTube Space LA. All of the four-walled 360-degree sets at YouTube Spaces resemble a hotel room — dubbed “Room 301” — inspired by Blumhouse’s aesthetic and designed in the style of the cities where the productions are taking place. (YouTube Space LA’s Room 301 set is pictured above.) Inside joke: 301 is the notorious view-count number that videos previously paused on as YouTube’s systems verified authenticity of views. CryptTV, a digital horror network that has a strategic partnership with Blumhouse, also is serving as a production adviser. It’s the fourth year running that YouTube has partnered with Hollywood horror-meisters for Halloween content. The goal: to promote YouTube Spaces as resources for its homegrown talent and expose them to well-known filmmakers and producers (as it did in partnership with Warner Bros. to promote David F. Sandberg’s “Lights Out” horror pic this summer). Previous partners for YouTube Spaces’ horror program included Guillermo del Toro and Legendary Entertainment; Skybound Entertainment, creators of “The Walking Dead”; and the Stan Winston School of Character Arts. “Our company loves telling scary stories on all platforms so we are excited to partner with YouTube to find out what scares its incredible community the most,” Jason Blum said in a statement. “The most frightening places are actually the ones where you feel safe and secure so it will be a lot of fun to experiment with the eerie hotel rooms YouTube built and see what happens when we turn the camera around on their creators.” In addition to the individual projects, YouTube Space LA will host to a “mega-collab” video with more than 20 top creators directed by PrankVsPrank’s Jesse Wellens in conjunction with the Big Picture Co., a production company that specializes in VR and 360-degree videos. The collab will serve as the origin story for the global narrative, showing creators receiving a key to Room 301 — which will lead them to experience their worst fears. YouTubers on tap for the mega-collab include Markiplier, Vitalyzdtv, Galo Frito, Furious Pete, Luba, KrazyRayRay, Seb La Frite, Coby Persin, PC Siqueira, Josh Paler Lin, The Gabbie Show, Jovem Nerd, Hopsin, TechnoBuffalo, Chachi Gonzales, KarenO, Jay & Arya, Rolê Gourmet, LaToyaForever, and Fischer’s.

It launched Wednesday.More Think you’ve got the hacking chops to breach a flagship Android phone? Google’s willing to pay you to prove it. On Wednesday, the Mountain View, California-based company announced Project Zero, a contest that asks enterprising hackers to demonstrate flaws in the company’s smartphone operating system in exchange for cold, hard cash. “Despite the existence of vulnerability rewards programs at Google and other companies, many unique, high-quality security bugs have been discovered as a result of hacking contests,” Google’s Natalie Silvanovich wrote in a blog post. “The goal of this contest is to find a vulnerability or bug chain that achieves remote code execution on multiple Android devices knowing only the devices’ phone number and email address.” Related: Top 5 Android security apps: Do they protect you? Here’s how it works: Hackers who uncover a serious security bug, exploit, or flaw in Android are encouraged to publish them on the Android issue tracker, a public forum devoted to documenting Android issues, from visual glitches to wonky Wi-Fi. Posts will have to be detailed — contest participants must share a “full description” of how the exploit works with the expectation that, if verified independently, they’ll be published on a public Google blog. They’ll have to work on Google’s branded Nexus devices, the Huawei-made Nexus 6P and LG’s Nexus 5X, plus any devices running an up-to-date build of Android 7.0 Nougat. And the more, the better — reported bugs can contribute to a larger Project Zero submission at any time during the contest’s six-month period, Google said. The prizes ain’t half bad. The winner of the contest takes home $200,000, while the runner-up will net $100,000. An undisclosed number of entries will be receive a consolatory prize of $50,000 as well. And there’s no way to lose: Google said bugs that aren’t submitted during the entry period may be considered for other contests like Android Security Rewards, as well as future, as-yet-unannounced promotions. Project Zero’s impetus, Google said, was discovering bugs that would otherwise go unreported. Another motivation? Developing fixes quickly, and in some cases pre-emptively. “Our main motivation is to gain information about how these bugs and exploits work,” Silvanovich wrote.” There are often rumors of remote Android exploits, but it’s fairly rare to see one in action. We’re hoping this contest will improve the public body of knowledge on these types of exploits.” Related: Google fixes critical security flaw affecting over 900 million Android devices More broadly, Google is hoping to dissuade unscrupulous types who otherwise might be inclined to sell exploits to the highest bidder. McAfee’s Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated that the cost of cybercrime is somewhere around $160 billion a year. And as use of mobile devices has climbed to unprecedented levels, the price of so-called zero-day bugs — exploits deriving from a previously unknown vulnerability — on internet black markets has mirrored that growth. A zero-day flaw in the latest version of iOS, for example, can sell for as much as $250,000, according to Wired, and some foreign governments have reportedly paid nearly half a million dollars for comparable bugs. “We’re hoping to get dangerous bugs fixed so they don’t impact users,” Silvanovich said. “We’re [hoping] that this contest will give us another data point on the availability of these types of exploits.” Project Zero began Wednesday.

In a letter to the president, the consumer advocacy group claims newly discovered documents reveal an inappropriate relationship between Google and the feds. The letter claims emails from 2011 to 2016 reveal Google recruited White House officials and federal regulators to lobby state officials against rules that may not have favored the tech company’s plans for self-driving vehicles. Consumer Watchdog suggested that White House officials deferred to Google rather than institute “a transparent process involving all stakeholders.” In one email obtained by the Campaign for Accountability’s Google Transparency Project, a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration official wrote the following to Google representatives: “I dropped Rob from this loop because I’m not sure whether he should be in Google communication to NHTSA at this point, although I’m not sure of the odd ethical lines we feds have to observe in this regard.” Emails obtained by Campaign for Accountability can be found here. Consumer Watchdog also pointed out how former NHTSA officials are actively involved in promoting self-driving cars alongside tech and auto manufacturing companies. More specifically, former NHTSA Administrator David L. Strickland is counsel and spokesman for the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, composed of Google, Lyft, Uber, Ford and Volvo. In addition, three other former NHTSA officials are representing Google and its self-driving program before current officials they used to work with. The consumer advocacy group is calling on President Obama to block NHTSA’s autonomous vehicle guidelines and to put an end to the revolving door between Washington, D.C., and corporate lobbyists. “In an effort to end the revolving door Consumer Watchdog has called on Secretary Foxx and (NHTSA) Administrator Rosekind to pledge they will not work as an employee or consultant to developers of self-driving autonomous vehicles for at least seven years after leaving their respective positions,” the group said in a press release. “So far, there has been no response and we call on you, Mr. President, to demand that commitment to ethical behavior from your appointees.” In July, Consumer Watchdog wrote an open letter to President Obama making the same request of halting regulations for autonomous vehicles. In that letter, the consumer group points out that Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx and Mark R. Rosekind, administrator for NHTSA, have vowed to help accelerate deployment of autonomous vehicles. The group asks for the administration not to move forward until adequate safety standards have been established through a public rulemaking process. The letter was sent out in the wake of a high-profile fatal crash involving Tesla’s autonomous system.

"Based on reports, it affects only Google for Work Gmail users," Google wrote on its Apps Status dashboard. "We will provide more information shortly." By 4.10am the company, which supplies email services to one billion people, reported that the service had been restored for some users. "We expect a resolution for all users within the next 1 hours [sic].

However, at 2.33pm the service remained "disrupted" and users whose email had been restored reported messages they were sent during the outage had not been delivered. Reiterating that it expected a resolution "in the near future", Google wrote: "Delivery of messages sent to affected users during the issue may be delayed."

We have identified the root cause of the issue and a potential fix is being implemented," the company posted at 5.40am.

The report looked at how the two U.S. technology giants, as well as others that control platforms through which smartphone applications are sold, use their positions of power to decide what app developers can and cannot do, Nikkei reported. (http://s.nikkei.com/2cYRX2s) Restricting what payment methods developers can accept and limiting their pricing freedom may not directly violate Japan's anti-monopoly law, but these practices lead to elimination of competitors, Nikkei reported. Japan's competition watchdog intends to investigate further and "may choose to conduct on-site inspections if there is sufficient suspicion of regulation breach," Nikkei reported, citing a high-ranking official.

There was no particular reason for it. It was just one of those days where every little annoyance of life was even more annoying, whether it was the person that walked into me on a busy city sidewalk because they were texting instead of paying attention, the long line at Starbucks for some morning coffee, or that co-worker that just didn't "get it" when I tried to explain what I needed her to accomplish that day. There are always going to be some days like this, but rather than have the whole day ruined (although sometimes that is inevitable), I have found a few things that can help turn my mood around. Exercise Exercising is probably my number one way to boost my mood. If you Google "exercise" and "mood," over 47 million hits come up. If Dr. Google says it, then it must be true. Seriously, exercise releases endorphins in your body, which are chemicals that reduce pain, enhance your mood and help you sleep better. Studies have found that not only do you get a short term benefit from exercise, but if you suffer from depression or anxiety, exercise can help with those conditions over the long term. I find that a good sweaty gym class or a yoga class benefits me the most when I am struggling with my mood. But if my schedule doesn't allow that, then even a simple walk can alleviate my mood, and I feel so much better when I return. Write it Out I recently started a habit called "Morning Pages" which is discussed in a book called The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron. This habit has come about because I have been participating in a couple of online courses for writing and creativity. The best way to explain Morning Pages is that you sit down first thing in the morning, before doing anything else (I always have to make my coffee first otherwise I'm a little too blurry for this), and you write in a notebook for three pages straight whatever comes to your mind. No stopping and no thinking, just longhand writing. As Julia Cameron explains, "Pages are meant to be, simply, the act of moving the hand across the page and writing down whatever comes to mind. Nothing is too petty, too silly, too stupid, too weird to be included." The idea is to get rid of all of the "junk" in your head so you can be more creative and productive the rest of the day. "We are victims of our own internalized perfectionist, a nasty internal and eternal critic, the Censor, who resides in our (left) brain and keeps up a constant stream of subversive remarks that are often disguised as the truth... Make this a rule: always remember that your Censor's negative opinions are not the truth." Some mornings I feel that I have nothing to write about (and there are mornings I really do not), but I try to write something. I sometimes start with my to do list just to get started, and I am always amazed with what I eventually write about. Yes, my pages are often whiny and messy. However, no one else is supposed to read them. Depending on who and what you are writing, you may just want to shred them when you are done. In fact, you are not really supposed to go back and read them. These are not the things you journal about because you want to remember them. These are the annoying things that circulate in your brain. It is interesting because I find that I often write about the same complaints day after day after day. This tells me that I need to change the situation I am complaining about, or if I cannot, then change my attitude about it. However, in any event I find that on the days I skip Morning Pages, my mood is bleaker, and it's lighter on the days that I have the time to do them. Breathe and Meditate This is a hard one for me to remember to do. Try and notice your breath the next time you are stressed or anxious. You will find that it is shallow and short. It is wonderful if you can block everything out for 15 or 20 minutes and just meditate, focusing on your breath. However, it is hard, and if your mind is churning a million miles an hour, it is difficult to turn it off. Depending on where you are, such as your desk at work, you know that you are not going to get that time without the phone ringing, an email coming in or someone otherwise interrupting you. When I am at my desk and notice I am feeling stressed, I just close my eyes for a moment and take five or six deep breaths, focusing only on the act of breathing in and out. This very short exercise immediately make me feel less anxious and able to focus easier on the task at hand. Hang Out with a Friend I was fortunate yesterday because May was coming to the city to meet up with me in the afternoon. I knew that this would help my mood. When I am in a bad mood, I often do not want to socialize with anyone. But being with a person whose company you enjoy is a great mood alleviator. We combined our time together with a very long walk in the city, and we may have enjoyed a libation on top of a rooftop bar (having a drink can help your mood, too, but it's not the healthiest of choices), but more important to my mood was the company. It is wonderful to spend time with someone who you can vent to, discuss unimportant topics, and laugh with. Go Back to Bed And when all else fails, just go back to bed. There is that old saying that "things always look better in the morning." Sometimes this is true and all you really need to improve your mood is get a good night's sleep. So go to bed early and wake up the next morning. Hopefully, things will look better and you will feel better. Do you have any favorite ways to improve your mood? -June We are as happy as we make up our minds to be. - Abraham Lincoln http://www.maymeetsjune.com/2016/06/29/5-ways-to-improve-your-mood/ 3 comments COMMENTS In order to comment on BlogHer.com, you'll need to be logged in.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Get early dibs to Chromecast updates, join the new Chromecast Preview Program By John Hoff - September 14, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter One of the prime ways for companies to get feedback for their software is through user preview programs, and this is exactly why Google is rolling out the Chromecast Preview Program. For heavy Chromecast users, this is a win-win situation – you get to test out upcoming software and feature updates ahead of everyone else. The only thing Google asks of you is to tell them what you think about it. To be very clear, Google says that this is not a beta program in that the updates the previewers will get is the same that will roll out to all other users. It’s just one way of getting people excited about new features, creating some hype, and of course getting feedback from users. If this is something you’d be interested in, and we think a lot of you will be, joining the program is actually pretty simple: 1. Open up the Google Cast app on your phone or tablet. 2. Tap the overflow menu button on the Chromecast device of your choice. 3. Tap Device settings. 4. Tap Preview Program and tap Join Program. That’s it! While this preview program will most likely not put out anything groundbreaking, users may actually get to see something nice way before everyone else does. There is no added cost to your hardware or finances, so this is a good program for you to get into.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS SEARCH Applications Competition Grows in the Map App Arena Although Google and Apple have the most popular GPS apps for smartphones, several other competitors have entered the market focusing on new and novel features. by George Avalos, The Mercury News / September 14, 2016 0 Flickr/Sal Petruzelli Marino/Waze map altered to show Los Angeles (TNS) -- When it comes to map apps, consumers are finding plenty of fresh paths to digital navigation thanks to Google, Apple and a whole host of rivals. Here WeGo, Waze, MapFactor, Mapquest, Scout GPS, Maps.Me and InRoute are just some of the apps that are challenging Google Maps and Apple Maps, which dominate smartphone mapping services, by focusing on new and novel features. The Players The two big map apps for the major phone platforms are the widely used Google Maps for Android and iPhone, and Apple Maps for the iPhone. Google Maps // What’s new: The ability to add interim stops to a destination, as well as estimates for how much time the detour will add to the trip. Apple Maps // What’s new: Apple upgrades, include an interim stops feature; users who want a reminder of where they parked their car can use a pin drop as a target. These free map apps attempt to challenge, or at least seek to address some shortcomings of, the two primary programs from Google and Apple. Waze // What’s new: A cleaner and fresh look, with quick access to frequent destinations; a new way to share your ETA with others. MapQuest // What’s new: Users can get speed limits to appear on their screens, including if you’re in a school zone. The route ahead is shown in what is called “2.5D” which Mapquest calls the “Perspective View.” Distance to a location now automatically updates. HERE WeGo // What’s new: Now easier to pick a destination and scroll to the mode of transportation. The app also offers ride-booking company Car2Go, as well as info on taxi services. MapFactor // What’s new: Better alternative route calculation; improved Google searches; the icon highlights when searching for a point of interest. Scout GPS // What’s new: Although turn-by-turn navigation is available, the app focuses on social interactions. Among the new features: You can send messages to friends and family; drive to the location of friends and family; share your location, route and real-time ETA; and ask a friend to pick you up. MAPS.ME // What’s New. The navigation elements take up less space; speed is now displayed; and an autozoom element has been added; bicycle riders can see terrain data; search results show hotel ratings and prices. inRoute // What’s New: Custom routes that let people avoid the heat on a summer road trip, or for those towing a trailer, ways to avoid steep hills; users can also chose routes with a lot of curves. Citymapper // What’s New: Travelers can get alerts about disruptions on transit systems in a city. Google and Apple, though, aren’t content to stay in the slow lane of innovation. Both have added new features to their map apps in recent months, including enabling users to add interim destinations to go along with the ultimate stop on a trip. Google’s changes rolled out in an update to Google Maps this summer; Apple’s changes will be included in iOS 10, the soon-to-be released next version of its mobile operating system. “Just open the app, enter a destination, tap the corner menu, and then click add a stop,” Google says in a blog post. “To rearrange the order of your stops, tap and hold the three-dot menu to the left of Add Stop and drag it to the position you want.” The Apple Maps service has new features that seek to meld activities and services associated with a trip. “Apps like OpenTable can integrate bookings right into Maps,” Apple says on its website. “Services like Uber and Lyft can make it easier for users to book a ride, without ever leaving the Maps app.” And while this navigational arms race shifts into high gear, it’s become apparent the original stand-alone GPS devices are becoming stranded by the side of the road. The proliferation of smartphone apps has reshaped a market once dominated by the stand-alone machines, such as TomTom, Garmin and Magellan. According to market research firm Berg Insight, worldwide shipments of personal navigation devices has decreased from 40 million units in 2008 to a projected 11 million by the end of this year. That number is expected to drop to just 7 million in 2019 — less than a tenth of projected smartphone map app users in that year. “Most consumers are using their smartphones as their primary navigation and map system,” said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, a market researcher. “Retailers, in a lot of cases, don’t really promote the stand-alone devices any more.” The established map apps from Google and Apple offer a wide array of features, with the centerpiece being turn-by-turn navigation. And while the emerging apps also typically offer turn-based directions, they all attempt to offer niche features that also can go beyond the basics of the apps from the tech titans. Google-owned Waze, whose service is separate from Google Maps, emphasizes the social aspects of traveling, and its new features include improved ways to share your estimated time of arrival with others. It also provides quick access to frequent destinations. “You can use Waze to find out about lots of things,” Bajarin said. “It pops up icons to tell you about traffic, police in your area, gives you suggestions on alternate routes. It’s the integration of social media with navigation.” Other apps also seek to meld the drive with other services. Scout GPS emphasizes social interaction, including the ability to message friends and family and share your location or destination with designated people. Here WeGo allows you to summon taxicabs or access a ride-hailing service. And some apps focus on improving the driving experience. Mapquest, one of the first computer-based navigation guides, recently began allowing drivers to see speed limits on the street they’re traveling. Maps.Me has added navigation elements that take up less space on the screen, and the speed the vehicle is traveling has been added. InRoute, designed mainly for long road trips, offers the ability to add numerous stops — and drivers can easily select routes that avoid areas with hot temperatures or hilly terrain. Saying it makes “cities easier to use,” Citymapper is geared to the daily commuter. In addition to vehicle navigation, the app has found a way to coordinate public transit and ride-hailing services so people can plan integrated trips. Citymapper’s service can be especially handy in big cities with major transit networks, said Michael Tchong, founder of Las Vegas-based Ubercool Innovation, which tracks technology trends. “The wave of the future is Citymapper,” Tchong said. “It integrates vehicle navigation, buses, subways, trains, Uber, Lyft all in one package. It will tell you whether the train you are on is running on time.” Experts predict the pace of innovation will pick up even more for map apps. “The map apps could become automated and start working as soon as you turn on your phone,” said Rob Enderle, an Oregon-based analyst who tracks the tech sector. “That way, if you’re driving, you don’t have to juggle a bunch of apps.” And map apps also may become more closely attuned to their users. They might start taking note of what types of restaurants you visit and only suggest those when you’re looking for a place to eat, Bajarin said. “The unique personalization of mapping is the next step,” he said. “We are on that cusp.” ©2016 The Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Why millions of people are helping Google build the most accurate Maps in the world Jillian D'Onfro Sep. 14, 2016, 5:25 PM 12,983 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jen Fitzpatrick, talking to a room full of Local GuidesGoogle A Los Angeles-based man says he started logging and editing information on Google Maps after a disastrous visit to an Urgent Care clinic: He chose it based on its purported hours of operation, but when he got there, found the office very-much closed. A Tunisian woman proudly describes how she has added more than 100 cafes, hotels, and restaurants to Google Maps in hopes of promoting tourism in her city. A disabilities advocate from the Dominican Republic says he adds notes to Maps on each place he visits indicating whether or not the location is wheelchair accessible. While each of the 75 people who crammed into a Google conference room on Tuesday afternoon had their own motivations for becoming a Maps “Local Guide,” the search giant had a unified reason to thank them. "Our ultimate aspiration is to build the richest, deepest, most detailed understanding of the real world that’s ever existed and to share that back to our users," Jen Fitzpatrick, the exec who leads Map, told them. "You are the community that’s helping us build that understanding." The Local Guides flew in to Google's HQ from all around the worldGoogle This week, Google invited dozens of its top Guides from all around the world for an all-expenses-paid trip to its headquarters to share their stories and give Maps engineers and product managers their advice. Local Guides are the volunteer fixers, finders, and reviewers of Google Maps. They add landmarks, post photos, check to make sure that listed data is accurate (is the wifi really free? does it actually open at 7 am?).  In the year since Google launched the program, more than 5 million people in 235 countries have answered questions and made edits. The Guides in that room alone had made over 330,000 contributions, including 5,000 entirely new places added on Maps. People could add and edit info on Maps before Local Guides, but there’s been a huge spike in user-generated content since it formalized the program, a push that Fitzpatrick prioritized since she took over the Maps division in fall 2014. A Local Guide is like the more accessible (but admittedly less sexy) version of a Google Trekker — you know, the camera-strapped explorers who take photos for Street View — because the company similarly relies on them to ensure its Maps are complete, accurate, and up-to-date for the 1 billion+ people who use the app every month. Not just another Yelp That’s why passionate Guides tells us that the program is more than just a Yelp competitor for getting info on the best restaurant: It’s about making sure that people know that a cafe around the corner just opened or park down the street exists as they're walking around a new place. As Fitzpatrick puts it, its making sure Maps "keep pace with the world as it changes." Alejandro Rodriguez Mann, a top Guide from Costa Rica, says that people in America may take it for granted how complete their Maps are, but that much less information exists in smaller countries like his (he says that Google-owned Waze actually has more accurate data than Maps does). Filling in Maps data is often top of mind when he’s out-and-about — it doesn’t take a lot of time and feels more productive than playing games on his phone. Houda Rouaissi poses with the Tunisian flagBusiness Insider Houda Rouaissi, the Tunisian woman, says the same of her country, where many cities look barren if you rely on Google Maps. “There are too many places that don’t exist,” she says. “Getting more places on the map could bring positive things for us.” While Rouaissi earnestly wants to help increase tourism for the sake of her country, she’s also indirectly helping to bolster Google’s advertising machine. Money in Maps Having the best, most accurate local location data is crucial to closing-the-loop on the "holy grail" of advertising. One of Google's biggest pitches to any brick-and-mortar advertiser is that it’s the best partner because its combination of search and maps data can show when its ads actually drive people into businesses.  "We’re trying to think about what are the next opportunities to make location even more central to an advertising experiences," Fitzpatrick tells Business Insider. The Maps division is still in the early stages of rolling out "promoted pin" ads which will suggest businesses, make store stock searchable, or offer deals. Having rich Maps data also affects any local search someone makes, even outside the app. A former Google exec with knowledge of the division gives Fitzpatrick credit for helping make strides in the very thorny area of location-based advertising. Meanwhile, Maps also continues to grow its licensing business, where apps and services like Trulia and Yelp pay Google to use its Maps APIs, even as some big customers like Uber phase it out. The location and business data stored in maps provides a key backbone as Google pushes towards a future where it proactively serves users helpful information. And more and more, that information comes from people like the Local Guides, who are the "eyes and ears" of maps.   "I think the fact that Maps is increasingly becoming a community-powered product and system is an incredibly exciting shift," Fitzpatrick says. "It opens up things that simple weren’t possible for us to know and understand before. We’re at the very early stages of a long journey." Check out some scenes from the Local Guides Summit: View As: One Page Slides Before the Summit sessions start, Local Guides posed for Google-centric photos. Business Insider Many came prepared to represent their country, either through their apparel or by bringing little gifts for other attendees. Scarves, chocolate, and keychains, like this one, were all being handed out. Business Insider More than 37 countries were represented total. Business Insider The day was all about group activities, learning about Google's roadmaps (like integrating more live information about events or natural disasters into Maps), and sharing opinions on how the product could be better.

We haven’t been able to confirm the report just yet; we hope to update this post shortly. Maris founded GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, in 2009, and said last month that he was stepping down to spend more time with his wife and young son and to mull several ideas. Maris was succeeded at GV by David Krane, a longtime managing partner at GV. Krane had joined the venture arm in 2010 after spending nearly 10 years as Google’s director of global communications and public affairs. GV employs roughly 70 people who are almost entirely in the U.S., though it has a small team of partners operating out of London, too. Its bets are as diverse as Uber, to Impossible Foods (maker of plant-based meats and cheeses), to the primary care company One Medical Group. (Maris gave us some useful insights into how the Alphabet unit works in a February interview.) Maris, who studied neuroscience at Middlebury College, has seemed to be intrigued by advances in life sciences in recent years, but one could imagine any new fund would have as wide-ranging a mandate as GV. More soon! 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Bill Maris Bio Bill founded GV in 2009 and oversaw all of the fund’s global activities until August 2016. GV is one of the most active investors in the world, with approximately $2 billion under management, 300 portfolio companies, and offices in Mountain View, San Francisco, Boston, New York, and London.

Sydney-based spokeswoman Clare Creegan said she could provide no further information, including on the cause of the fault or how widespread it was.   - Stuff Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Technology story: Uber riders in Pittsburgh get a taste of driverless future Technology Homepage Comments Ad Feedback Most popular Viewed Shared Commented President-elect Donald Trump name-checks New Zealand in morning Twitter tirade Live: 7.8 New Zealand earthquake 'I'm buggered - I need a beer': first overland relief reaches Kaikoura OPINION: Brian Tamaki can go to hell, but his followers can still be saved Fears of rapid failure of new lake caused by quake near Kaikoura Quake evacuees from Kaikoura arrive in Christchurch on HMNZS Canterbury Over 100 rentals abandoned after the earthquake What Kaikoura looks like now, after the 7.5 earthquake - in pictures Bikies left stranded in Kaikoura at the local pub Weta 'IT geek' captures Wellington tsunami surge after earthquake rocks New Zealand Famous seal breeding ground destroyed by quake 'I'm buggered - I need a beer': first overland relief reaches Kaikoura Live: 7.8 New Zealand earthquake Quake evacuees from Kaikoura arrive in Christchurch on HMNZS Canterbury Post-quake freeze on new insurance cover catches out home buyers and sellers Hail stones the size of golf balls hit Ashburton during storm Pictures of rescued quake cows released Feature video: The quake - and everything that followed For info on toilets, take a seat and get bowled over Questions asked in capital but engineers say no such thing as 'earthquake-proof' special offers Ad Feedback National World Business Technology Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Stuff.co.nz About Us | Contact Us | View Mobile Site Subscribe Text | Follow us on Facebook and Twitter | Newspapers | Magazine subscriptions | RSS - Top Stories Services Stuff Fibre | Newspapers in Education | A-Z Directories | Online Advertising | Print Advertising | Careers Classifieds Death Notices | Celebrations | Trade Me | Jobs | Property | Motors | Accommodation | Personals | Newspaper Classifieds Newspapers Dominion Post | The Press | Waikato Times | Auckland Now | Sunday News | Sunday Star-Times   Marlborough Express | Manawatu Standard | Nelson Mail | Southland Times | Taranaki Daily News | Timaru Herald Other Sites Essential Mums | Cuisine | NZ House & Garden | NZ Fishing News | NZ Life & Leisure | NZ Gardener | Fairfax Archives Breaking news?

ALSO READ Juncker touts free telecom benefits, upsets Web firms with EU plan EU's Juncker says doubts over Nord Stream 2 pipeline plan 'beyond legal' Juncker to rally divided, post-Brexit EU, push investment EU's Juncker says Brexit is not a beginning of end of EU Europe divided, Juncker urges post-Brexit EU to unite By Foo Yun Chee and Alissa de Carbonnel BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced measures on Wednesday to rein in the world's technology giants, improve broadband speeds and cut the cost of internet access, trying to rally popular support for an EU battered by Brexit. The reforms are likely to shift some wealth from internet services such as Google and Facebook to European telecom groups, which have largely missed out on the tech sector's surging growth and have lobbied hard for more flexible rules that would give them more money to invest in faster broadband access. They complain that Google, Facebook's WhatsApp, Microsoft's Skype and other services have made billions by piggy-backing on their networks for free. Among the changes, Juncker wants to roll back European Union rules that bar the likes of Deutsche Telekom, Orange and Telefonica from co-investing or sharing network capacity. The Commission would expand rules covering security and confidentiality for phone providers to internet-based communication services. "We propose today to equip every European village and every city with free wireless internet access," Juncker told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, without giving more details of how the EU would help to achieve this goal within the next decade. The plan would also extend the copyright powers of publishers, music artists and other content owners to seek a share of the revenue which internet services make from linking to publishing snippets of content such as news. Juncker said the EU would also help to protect the personal online data of EU citizens through legal framework changes. The Silicon Valley tech giants are accused by European consumer groups of stockpiling users' data for commercial ends. The unveiling of Juncker's reform plan starts what is expected to be a fierce fight among EU lawmakers, member states and industry groups before it can become law. INTERNET SETBACK The plan will add weight to accusations from across the Atlantic that EU measures in recent years to protect competition and privacy and crack down on illegal state aid are targeting the U.S. tech giants unfairly. Critics, including U.S. President Barack Obama, have said the Commission is using tighter regulations against Silicon Valley companies in the hope of creating regional versions of Google or Apple. Last year, Obama dismissed these moves as "commercially driven", taken because European tech firms "can't compete" with U.S. rivals. The tech industry expressed its displeasure on Wednesday. EDiMA, a trade group backed by top U.S. and European tech firms ranging from Airbnb and Candy Crush game maker King.com to Amazon and Google, called the copyright framework more 1916 than 2016. "It does not reflect the current environment in which users access and consume content online and lacks the ambition called for by most European stakeholders and consumers to realise a Digital Single Market," EDiMA said in a statement. Juncker's plans, highlighted in his annual State of the Union address, will be seen as an effort to counter euroscepticism by showing how technocratic institutions in Brussels can deliver improvements to people's lives. The Commission's broader efforts to create the "digital single market" are seen widely as favouring domestic telecom and media companies. Only eight of the top 100 global tech companies are headquartered in Europe, according to an A.T. Kearney study. Some of Juncker's consumer-friendly measures are also likely to impact the telecom industry, including a plan for free mobile roaming and wireless internet in cities across the EU. In a surprise move this month before the speech, Juncker withdrew proposals to limit the number of days consumers can use their mobile phones abroad without paying extra fees after criticism that the rules favoured telecoms firms. He ordered the draft to be revised in what allies and officials said showed the EU executive wanted to be seen to listen to voters three months after Britons opted to leave the bloc. COPYRIGHT STORM Juncker said that the EU would work to defend people's right to privacy, saying: "Europeans do not like drones overhead recording their every move, or companies stockpiling their every mouse click. In Europe privacy matters." His copyright proposal could give publishers more bargaining power with Google when demanding payment from the world's most popular internet search engine. The outlines of this proposal stirred controversy when they were leaked last month but Wednesday's plan provided few specifics. "The creation of content is not a hobby, it is a profession," Juncker said. "As the world goes digital we have also to empower our artists and creators ... I want journalists, publishers and authors to be paid fairly for their work." Google called the plan a backward step for copyright in Europe that would limit its ability to help news publishers generate advertising revenue by sending traffic their way via Google's Google News and Search properties. "After all, paying to display snippets is not a viable option for anyone," Google Vice President for global policy Caroline Atkinson wrote in a blog. The Society of Audiovisual Authors, speaking on behalf of media licensing rights groups, praised elements of the package. However, it said the plan failed to provide an "unwaivable right to remuneration" for European film, TV and multimedia screenwriters and directors to make a living from their works. Benoît Machuel, General Secretary of the International Federation of Musicians, said: "What we need is a right for all performers to be paid each time a performance is used online on iTunes, Netflix or Spotify." Grassroots internet rights groups said the draft proposal to extend copyright for news publishers even to short sections of news repeats the mistakes of laws passed in Germany and Spain, which hurt publishers and internet users alike. "We now have a proposal that is poison for Europeans' free speech, poison for European business and poison for creativity," said Joe McNamee, Executive Director of European Digital Rights. "It could not conceivably be worse." The EU initiatives got a thumbs up from ETNO, the European telecoms operators' association whose members include Orange and Telefonica. "We need to ensure that the new Code (proposal) provides technologically-inclusive incentives, allowing our members to deliver a further increase in broadband investment," ETNO Chairman Steven Tas said. The telecoms industry had already lobbied against the burden of the original proposal of allowing them to charge extra only for clients who use their phones abroad for more than 90 days a year or 30 in a row. The European Consumer Organisation welcomed Juncker's reforms but expressed concerns they would favour dominant market players and do little to lower prices on international calls. "Consumers need operators to compete with one another in the market to deliver innovative services at cheaper prices," its head Monique Goyens said in a statement.

clock menu more-arrow Who will buy Twitter? We ranked all the possible buyers. So glad you asked. by Kurt Wagner and Kara Swisher Sep 14, 2016, 4:37pm EDT Image credit: Recode tweet share Linkedin Twitter's board is leaning toward making a sale with possible suitors including Google and Salesforce, amongst other tech companies, as CNBC's David Faber reported Sept. 23. The stock was up as much as 20 percent after the report. The following story, which ran Sept. 14, breaks down all the likely (and unlikely) buyers and why. At pretty much every recent dinner party, tech gathering and social shindig where we have run into the digital elite, everyone seems to have the same question: What's going to happen to Twitter? The travails of the San Francisco-based social communications company have been an ongoing soap opera for a long time now, one that has gotten Google-sized attention despite its relatively small size and tech impact. Like the slow-moving train wreck of Yahoo, to which Twitter is increasingly compared, it’s partly due to the media fascination with the company. And there is no doubt that the app’s social impact is immeasurable, especially in the way it holds a perpetual mirror in front of all the narcissists in the world (Trump! Kanye! Various and sundry VCs on Sand Hill Road!). Or, as former Twitter board member Mike McCue told us recently: "Twitter is a huge phenomenon more than it is a company." Ouch. Here’s the case for and against all the possible Twitter suitors that keep cropping up. But perhaps that's the truth, even as CEO Jack Dorsey and his top execs seek to bring growth and value back to the company he founded. It raises the question: What is going to happen to Twitter? At a projected $18 billion price tag, the options can be tough to imagine. Luckily, we did all the hard work for you! There is a caveat: So far, the company’s top brass has not wanted to sell and has indicated that the hope is to remain independent. But because it’s Twitter, that did not stop Dorsey’s co-founder and director Evan Williams from setting off a ruckus after he was asked about a possible sale. Williams no-commented and then noted that the board would "consider the right options." No surprise, the non-answer caused the stock to pop. It’s down again, though, and the question now becomes whether anyone thinks there are actual buyers for the company. As one former exec there told us recently, sotto voce: "Twitter is the most invaluable company that no one really wants to buy." Double ouch. That’s not exactly true, which is why we put on our green-shade visors and did some investment banking of our own. While we may lack the gumption of the ever-wily Frank Quattrone, we make up for it in energetic guessing, larded with a lot of actual reporting. So here’s the case for and against all the possible Twitter suitors that keep cropping up. Google Justin Sullivan / Getty The case for Google (Kurt): There’s a good reason Google’s name always tops this list: It makes the most sense! Google has the money — Alphabet generated more revenue last quarter alone ($21 billion) than Twitter is actually worth. And while the company has tried its hand at social media before (I think we can all now agree that Google+ has been a minus), Twitter would give it a legitimate social platform to tie in with YouTube, which is now feeling heat from Facebook and Snapchat, which are very social. Could Google make good use of Twitter properties like Vine and Periscope by coupling them in some kind of media hybrid offering with YouTube? Maybe! Look how happy they are! Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Vanity Fair Google already understands the advertising business, so no problems there. Then imagine Twitter’s livestreaming pitch to the NFL and other major rights holders with Google’s backing on distribution. Google could essentially bring Twitter private, and allow it to fix whatever user and product problems it has away from the investor criticism that comes when you’re a public company. There’s a lot to like here. Haters like to point out that Alphabet CEO Larry Page doesn’t give a rip about social media, but he’s no longer running Google. Sundar Pichai is. Couple that with former Google exec Omid Kordestani now chairing Twitter’s board, and the whole Larry hates social argument may no longer mean much. The case against Google (Kara): Kurt, Kurt, Kurt. Larry no longer runs Google? When pigs fly perhaps, but today making a nearly $20 billion purchase is something the testy and robotic founder will most definitely need to weigh in on. And he does have disdain for social, for reasons that include the fact that no one at Google is social or understands the paradigm. But Google lost to Facebook a long time ago on that score, and Page seems to have decided that the company’s future is not in this direction. Rather, his recent hire of Diane Greene to compete with Amazon and others in the cloud and his artificial intelligence plays are the kind of all-in investments that make the most sense. And then there are the regulatory issues that come with any big Google purchase. Will the politicians in D.C. like Google owning all of search and the still-influential social platform upon which the recent election has been playing out? No, they will not. Ask the first Twitter presidential candidate, Donald Trump, if he’d like the Democratic-leaning Google to own his fave platform and he would blow a very large raspberry on the podium. Vanity aside, it’s not an acquisition that even the roll-over regulators of the various U.S. agencies will swallow easily. As for the hair-trigger Europeans? Nein! Non! Or, as persistent Google foe and European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager would surely declare: Ingen! Hand in glove with the many antitrust issues, there is the mass of publicity that comes with owning Twitter. It is watched by the media like no other company (largely because reporters love to talk about nothing more than themselves, even if no one else cares). While Google gets a lot of attention, the kind that Twitter gets is not the same and not welcome to the secretive nature of the search giant. And then there are the ugly controversies around abuse. While Google perhaps has the tech chops to help improve the tools to fix the ongoing debacle in this arena, it would take a massive PR effort that is simply not in the company’s wheelhouse. Google is all about the algorithm and Twitter is all about humanity. You see the disconnect here. Perhaps most simply, Google already has Twitter on its platform via search. Whether it needs more than that for that much money is a very good question. Facebook The case for Facebook (Kurt): Facebook does a lot of things really well. One of those things is selling and delivering mobile advertising, which, coincidentally, is how Twitter makes money. Facebook is also great at user growth — it has three separate billion-user products, plus Instagram, which has more than 500 million users. Twitter has been stuck right around 300 million monthly users for over a year and needs a serious distribution jolt. Facebook also does a lot of things well that Twitter wants to do, like video distribution and messaging. What Facebook doesn’t do well is what Twitter does best: Distributing breaking and real-time news. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked a lot on the company’s last earnings call about live video and immediacy around the news, but Facebook hasn’t figured it out, as evidenced by its trending topics nightmare that doesn’t seem to go away. Buying Twitter could help solve that problem and, at the very least, ensure the company doesn’t fall into a competitor’s hands (see: Google). The case against Facebook (Kara): Yes, the real-time news argument is a good one. But is solving it worth a $20 billion check? Or could Facebook just use the same tactics as it has in its complete lift of Snapchat Stories using its Instagram unit? It would be much harder, obviously, as replicating Twitter as a global news platform is not the same as copying hot software. But it is certain that Facebook probably has a lot of cheaper innovations to beating Twitter at news than the trouble it might buy with Twitter. Most central to that trouble is all the grief that would come with Twitter’s massive basket of deplorables. And we do mean deplorables here, and we’re not apologizing for saying so, because it is a cesspool of abuse and ugliness far too often. All those anonymous users spewing all that hatred is most definitely not amenable to Facebook’s walled-garden approach to social, which has been a huge success for it. And Facebook itself has been pretty bad about dealing with similar controversies over what it bans (see the recent mistake over the "napalm girl" photo). More complexity seems to be something that the company is incapable of dealing with, even if it introduces better tools. And as good as they are, neither Zuckerberg nor COO Sheryl Sandberg are equipped to handle the mass of controversy that Twitter brings with it. Plus, as with Google, there would be regulatory issues that would be tough to overcome. (Sorry, Elliot Schrage — you’re good, but not that good!) Facebook tried to buy Twitter a long time ago for $500 million. That was then. Microsoft Justin Sullivan / Getty The case for Microsoft (Kara): There is no real case, because what kind of problem does Twitter solve for Microsoft? None! The company is turning very clearly into an enterprise company, after many — so many — debacles in the consumer space. But okay, I’ll try. It would be nice for Microsoft to have some traction in social, in mobile and in ads. Maybe Twitter could be integrated in with LinkedIn, for which the software giant recently paid $26 billion, bringing in a savvy media-focused exec in its CEO Jeff Weiner. He’d surely have some ideas for it. But that’s all I got. The case against Microsoft (Kurt): Kara pretty much nailed it up top. Microsoft already broke the bank this year for an unprofitable social network in LinkedIn, so buying another one would be foolish. Microsoft hasn’t hit any home runs with other social and communication acquisitions, such as Yammer and Skype (does anyone actually use Skype on mobile?), and there’s nothing here to imply a Microsoft-owned Twitter would be any different. Plus, if Twitter is serious about getting into TV-style livestreaming, it would be better selling to a company with actual media experience. Plus plus, Microsoft is basically out of the online advertising industry. Its business is primarily driven by enterprise tools and services, not consumer brands, and making a splashy consumer play would be more distracting than anything. Apple Stephen Lam / Getty The case for Apple (Kara): This is an interesting question, given how beloved Apple is to Twitter’s Dorsey. He’s a longtime Steve Jobs fanboy and also has a lot of respect for the company today. A sale to Apple is one that you can see the recalcitrant Dorsey saying "yes" to more easily. Here’s what Twitter will help Apple with: A real-time news offering (Apple News is just awful); a livestreaming opportunity that it could tout on iPhones; a decent social presence and worldwide platform (remember Ping? I do, but only me!); an ad business that Apple can actually succeed with; a still-cool mobile app. It’s not hard to see how Apple could integrate Twitter with a lot of its services and make them instantly better. Still, Apple simply does not have a social media culture, and it would need Dorsey there to lead the efforts. And he has another job over at Square, as you might have heard. The case against Apple (Kurt): So, so wrong, Kara. Twitter doesn’t have a single thing Apple might want. Twitter is an advertising business, and Apple is not good at advertising. Twitter doesn’t have any hardware products, and owns virtually nothing when it comes to the kind of high-quality content Apple currently distributes, such as music, movies and television. Apple already offers a superior messaging product to Twitter, and has its own curated news app. And the abuse issues — not the Apple image at all. Maybe Twitter could make Apple a little cooler? But it would be cheaper to just buy something hip, like Carpool Karaoke (Oh, wait!). Big Pipes: Verizon or Comcast Justin Sullivan / Getty The case for Big Pipes (Kara): One major thing: Mobile streaming! It’s a thing, in case ya didn’t know! Let’s start with Verizon, which has so many billions of dollars of cash on its balance sheet and no idea what to do with it. Well, it did use about $10 billon of that to buy stumbling Internet brands AOL and Yahoo, and so far the market has not punished them for it. Why not double down with Twitter and make it a trifecta? Also, Verizon has the management that could actually coordinate it all, especially AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. He’d be helped if he could get Twitter execs like COO Adam Bain and CFO Anthony Noto to stay. Comcast is run by smart people (Disclaimer: NBCUniversal has a huge investment in Recode owner Vox Media) who like to buy value and, if not growth. That’s not Twitter these days, but one reason for them to buy it is that they have a lot of content and other stuff that would be great on the platform. Plus, regulators would let them buy the property, as opposed to video and TV companies, which Comcast can’t do much of. Twitter is not a video company, because wishing you are a video company does not make it so. Could it be someday? Maybe. While I think Verizon is a more likely buyer than Comcast, these would be big stretches for both, and therefore probably more trouble than it is worth. The case against Big Pipes (Kurt): For all the news Twitter has made around its livestreaming efforts, it’s a very minor player in the world of live video distribution. It doesn’t own any significant rights for any significant portion of time, and it isn’t creating new programming. The NFL broadcasts it's distributing aren’t even produced by Twitter — NBC and CBS handle that. Twitter is simply the platform for everyone else’s content, and we have no idea how large or how valuable Twitter’s audience actually is. When Yahoo streamed an NFL game back in 2015, the viewership numbers were terrible by NFL standards. There isn’t much reason (yet) to believe Twitter’s streams will fare any better. Add in the fact that Verizon has paid a combined $10 billion for Yahoo and AOL in the past 18 months. It could probably afford Twitter, too, but what a lineup of troubled companies that would be to fix. Big Media: News Corp/21st Century Fox, Disney Getty Images The case for Big Media (Kara): The case for big media buying Twitter? Because they are still old media, no matter how hard they try to pretend otherwise. When it comes to appealing to younger audiences (also known as digital audiences), even growth-starved Twitter beats them. The main reason for media companies to buy Twitter is that they don’t want another media company to buy Twitter and, good God, not Google or Facebook either, because then all that’s left is Snapchat (and Evan Spiegel is not selling, last time we checked). There has been a lot more noise about Rupert Murdoch’s Fox buying it than any other media giant, but that would be a big bet for him and his two sons. And while Disney has a taste for digital properties (Hello, Vice!) and while Dorsey is on the board of Disney, so is Facebook’s Sandberg. Would I like to be a fly on the wall of that board meeting? Yes! The case against Big Media (Kurt): How many traditional media companies can comfortably afford an $18 billion acquisition? Few. Twitter is likely too expensive for News Corp/Fox or Time Warner or Disney. Media organizations already get most of the benefits of Twitter’s product — free content distribution— without the headache that comes with running it. Plus, Twitter is hungry for any and all high-quality video content, which means rights holders like Turner (Time Warner) can easily ink deals with Twitter if need be. No need to open the checkbook. There’s also this: Twitter is valuable because media companies see it as a neutral platform. Imagine this scenario that one source jokingly suggested: "The Arab Spring live on Twitter, brought to you by Rupert Murdoch and Fox News!" Yeah, not so much. The Chinese Internet giants The case for a Chinese buyer (Kurt): Chinese tech companies are all looking for a foot in the door when it comes to monetizing U.S. consumers. Twitter could be that giant toe as a big trophy property! Tencent-owned messaging app WeChat, which dominates in China, has tried unsuccessfully to build a U.S. audience in the past, and appears to have given up that plan. Momo, another Chinese messaging service, has a similar story. That might make a company like Twitter, which has 66 million U.S. users and lots of business partnerships with U.S. advertisers, an attractive option to Chinese tech giants like Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu. The case against a Chinese buyer (Kara): Have you all heard about the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States? Well, welcome to the committee that would say "no" to such a deal tout de suite. As it notes on its website, "CFIUS is an inter-agency committee authorized to review transactions that could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person (‘covered transactions’), in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States." In other words: The deal busters. Simply put, the U.S. will not let Chinese interests own a global platform like Twitter. You think Trump is mean to the Mexicans? Imagine what he’d say about this sale. Same with Hillary Clinton and pretty much everyone else in D.C. Salesforce Justin Sullivan / Getty The case for Salesforce (Kurt): Well, Salesforce just bought Quip, whose CEO, Bret Taylor, recently joined Twitter’s board. Some people think he’d be a good fit to run Twitter’s core product, too, although he says he’s not interested. Otherwise ... I got nothing. Kara? The case against Salesforce (Kara): I got nothing. While CEO Marc Benioff likes to buy things, according to sources at Salesforce, these rumors about his interest in Twitter are just that, and such a purchase is unlikely. But it is a fun idea, because Benioff is fun! Private Equity Andy Dean Photography / Shutterstock The case for private equity (Kara): What a wonderful world it would be if Twitter could be run in a quiet place, instead of being perpetually naked in the middle of Times Square as it is now. It could cut costs, thin down, focus and maybe finally realize its very unrealized potential. All gone would be the persistent detractors (Saccattack!), the shareholder activists (who are gathering even now for a new attack), the irksome media (I blame myself) and all the leaky board members, employees, ex-employees and sundry players. Sounds dreamy? It is! Calling Silver Lake, stat! The case against private equity (Kurt): I blame Kara, too! The biggest issue here is price. Twitter is just too expensive as it stands right now for most private equity firms to justify purchasing. These kinds of deals usually happen when a business actually makes money — investors want some kind of return on their investment — and Twitter is still losing money each quarter. recode_divider Apple With Apple now selling used iPhones, the new phone market may have peaked Health Care 23andMe President Andy Page is departing Recode Daily Recode Daily: Snapchat is speeding toward its IPO Chorus Terms of Use Privacy Policy Communications Preferences Contact Send Us a Tip Masthead Sponsorships Podcasts Newsletters All Systems Operational Check out our status page for more details.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google finally got around to releasing Android Nougat for the Nexus 6P last week, but if you’re holding onto an older Nexus device you could be stuck waiting even longer. Specifically, it looks like the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 LTE are still weeks away from getting the update. Android Police reached out to Google and got a vague promise that the new operating system would hit those gadgets “in the coming weeks.” It’s unclear exactly what’s taking so long, though it’s possible the company could be fixing some issues with the software first. At least we know Nougat will eventually come to the older Nexus smartphone and tablet. Android Nougat is a pretty big update, introducing new multi-tasking features that should be particularly useful on the Nexus 9 LTE tablet. It adds 72 new emoji and better battery saving with an upgraded version of Doze. Google also improved how notifications work, making it easy to respond without opening the app and bundling together multiple messages from the same service. If you don’t feel like waiting, you can try signing up for the Android N Developer Preview, though Android Police notes that Google may have stopped taking registrations at this point.

March 25, 2015. (REUTERS/Robert Galbraith) Facebook and Twitter are tired of people using their social media platforms to spread what they believe is false information and low-quality news, so they’ve joined with a number of global news organizations to “improve” the quality of the news content they offer. The project, called First Draft, is backed by Google and Google Labs, and will offer information on “best practices for journalism in the online age,” developed with a carefully curated group of partner sites. Unsurprisingly, those “news sources,” on which Google, Facebook and Twitter are relying on to filter out supposedly dishonest or untrustworthy news content, are almost exclusively left-leaning. According to Agence France-Presse, one of the primary partner organizations, the group includes “Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, The New York Times, Washington Post, BuzzFeed News, CNN, ABC News of Australia, ProPublica, AFP, The Telegraph, France Info, Breaking News, Le Monde’s Les Decodeurs, International Business Times UK, Eurovision News Exchange and Al Jazeera Media Network.” It’s not entirely clear what “false” information this new First Draft organization means to screen out, but the announcement comes at a time when many of First Draft’s partner organizations have been decrying what they see as the media’s failure to “fact check” statements by Donald Trump. Jenni Sargent who heads the First Draft project told AFP, “Filtering out false information can be hard. Even if news organizations only share fact-checked and verified stories, everyone is a publisher and a potential source…We are not going to solve these problems overnight, but we’re certainly not going to solve them as individual organizations.” Google is likely to insist that this is just a project to help journalists better prepare for an online audience, and to help social media users find the most trustworthy news sources on the web, but Google, Facebook and Twitter’s history with filtering news shows they are far from credible moderators. The announcement comes on the heels of months of controversy involving Facebook’s filtering of news content, and allegations that political bias against conservative news outlets ran rampant through Facebook’s “trending topics” operation. And on Friday, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz (who’s no longer with the company) announced that he and his wife are donating $20 million to Democratic groups in an effort to stop Trump. Twitter has faced similar problems, with conservatives asserting that Twitter’s “Trust and Safety Council” is stacked with social justice warriors and progressive activists, looking to turn the social network into a safe space, free from non-liberal opinions. Just this week, both Facebook and Twitter faced criticism over what appeared to be evidence that both social networks censored stories about Hillary Clinton’s Sunday “medical episode.” Despite almost universal media coverage, the story did not appear in either Facebook or Twitter’s “trending topics.” Google itself, the driving force behind the First Draft project, is openly left leaning. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, and its former CEO Eric Schmidt, have been working alongside Hillary Clinton’s Presidential campaign as a product development arm, and Google itself has extensive financial ties to the Democratic Party. Most recently, Google faced allegations of search manipulation and search bias, changing how (and whether) users found information on the Clinton Foundation and its ties to the Department of State.

 The latest Android delay is why I'm sticking to iPhone Antonio Villas-Boas Sep. 14, 2016, 4:09 PM 23,048 facebook linkedin twitter email print Every once in a while, I'll see a headline about some old flagship Android phone like the HTC One M9 or one of Samsung's  Galaxy S phones that's "finally" getting Android 6.0 Marshmallow, the version of Android that was released a year ago. I find that incredible.  That means the majority of Android users are devoid of the latest features, improvements, and security updates that Google has made to its operating system. It's a problem called "fragmentation," where a wide range of devices are still running older versions of software. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider The usual solution for Android fans who want to get the latest Android updates on their phones is to use Google's own Nexus smartphones. They run the pure version of Android and they also get the latest Android updates as soon as they're released by Google.  Indeed, the latest Nexus 5X and 6P smartphones have been getting the Android 7.0 updates since its release date. However, the guarantee of getting the latest and greatest updates from Google if you're a Nexus owner seems to be fading. On September 14, over three weeks after Android 7.0 Nougat was released, Google confirmed to Android Police that people with Google's very own Nexus 6 smartphone – a phone released in 2014 – won't receive the latest version of Google's very own mobile operating system until the "coming weeks." I'd be pretty irritated if I was a Nexus 6 owner. And even more so if I was a Nexus 5 owner, as  the excellent Nexus 5 from 2013 won't be receiving the update at all.  Meanwhile, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, called iOS 10, was available to download for the iPhone 4s – a phone released in 2011 – and up from the day the update was released on September 13. This HTC One M9 is "up to date," despite running on Android 5.0. Skye Gould/Tech Insider This contrast in how well both companies issue important software updates to arguably the most important pieces of technology you own just solidified my reasoning to stick with iPhone, which is unfortunate because I actually prefer the Android operating system over iOS (the reasons why are for another post). Getting the latest update is important, as many updates contain security patches and fixes that help protect your personal data, like pictures, emails, messages, and anything else from malicious attacks. After all, there's quite a large chunk of your life in your smartphone. It's rare, but all it takes it one attack to do some serious damage. Plus, updates also come with improvements of existing features, as well as cool new features. At the end of the day, I just like running the latest, most recent software of pretty much any gadget I own. I'm one of those people who'll immediately update apps once I see the red stamp on the App icon in iOS. That cozy feeling when you're "up to date." Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider Google recognizes that fragmentation is a problem. It's so bad that some app developers have dropped support for Android. To fix the fragmentation issue, Bloomberg reported that Google will "shame" third-party Android phone manufacturers into pushing out the latest updates faster than before. And The Information reported that Google is planning on working directly with chip-makers to create hardware that works seamlessly with its software, like iOS does with the iPhone.  We're eagerly awaiting the release of Google's next Nexus device, which some rumors claim will be renamed "Pixel." Hopefully, it'll show signs that Google is addressing the problem of fragmentation and the issues its facing with deploying updates to its own Nexus devices, as well as other Android devices. For now, though, it's iPhone for me.  EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

These techniques were all focused on solving one problem — how to convey textual content in a beautifully artistic form on the web while keeping it accessible, both to people and search engines. Achieving such a goal in a world of web design without the readily available custom fonts and powerful CSS tools of today was quite a feat. Taking my cue from Rathi’s article, I set out to tackle the following questions: Image replacement techniques used to be quite popular. Today, these methods of replacing text with background images often get a bad rap among web developers. I’ll be examining some of the reasons why later in this article, but given this is the case, which tools and best practices can we use instead? Are image replacement techniques just ghosts from web design past, or can image replacement techniques still be meaningfully used today without fear of making the web uglier? Let’s begin by looking at the best tool for the job. Best Tool for the Job: Web Fonts and CSS If your content is text, use text, don’t use images of text. With the tools at your disposal today, you will hardly need any images in order to relay textual content in a beautiful form. Easy access to a staggering number of custom web fonts, great browser support for the CSS @font-face property and font streaming services like Typekit and Google Fonts all give you enormous power to communicate a brand, convey emotion, and make an impact with stunning typography on the web. The capabilities of modern CSS make it a breeze to control transparency levels, add text shadows, blend modes, and even animation to your text – no Photoshop or JavaScript sleight of hand required. Below is just an example of what you can do with web fonts and CSS: Smart Designs website displays great typography without any images, only web fonts and CSS. Key benefits of using text instead of images of text are: Users can easily resize text and change its color to meet their requirements. Screen readers can access text and search engine bots can crawl and index it. It is the semantically correct approach and respects the separation of concerns, the relevance of which is also advocated by the W3C recommendations for meeting Web Content Accessibility Guidelines’ (WCAG) success criteria. If you’re using custom fonts, it’s easy to provide web-safe fonts as a fallback in the CSS font stack. However, as many of you are aware, this approach doesn’t work for every situation. So… What If Web Fonts and CSS Are Not Always Up To the Job? There are situations when web fonts and CSS are not quite enough to achieve the result you’re after and turning to graphics makes sense. A website’s logo is a case in point. Logos are integral to a brand, which means that you can’t modify, even slightly, a logo without compromising brand identity. There may be cases when you can’t reproduce the logo exactly using web fonts and CSS. Perhaps, the logo’s typeface is not readily available on the web, or the graphical artwork can’t be faithfully recreated just with CSS. Using a graphical element seems the way to go. However, although you want users to see the graphical element displayed on your website, you also want screen readers and bots to have access to the brand name the logo represents. Also, consider the use of icons without supporting text. The real issue here is that screen readers and search engine crawlers have a hard time making sense of what the icon means. Icons are not text, rather they stand for text. For instance, the now familiar hamburger icon stands for the word “menu”, but it is not itself the word “menu”. Therefore, displaying just the icon without supporting text on the web can raise serious accessibility concerns. In both cases above, the goal is to convey some information by way of an image without compromising access by screen readers and search engine crawlers to its textual content. Image replacement techniques made this somewhat possible in the past, so it is worth looking into whether something better is out there today to do the job, which was not widely available some time ago. Here are a few options. Inline SVG Today, a great way of including a logo in a web page when you can’t leverage the power of web fonts and CSS is inline SVG. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, which is an XML-based graphic format. The technique I’m interested in involves creating an SVG graphic of the logo and dumping its code straight into the HTML document. If you export your SVG from an editor like Illustrator or Inkscape, you can go a step further and optimize its output by getting rid of redundant markup. If you inspect the SitePoint website logo, you’ll see an example of this technique in action: Inline SVG used to create the logo on SitePoint website. That’s not all. Inline SVG also works wonders when used as a way of adding crisp-looking icons to a webpage. If you’re eager to learn more, check out Chris Coyer’s SVG course on CSS-Tricks, which also includes a few video tutorials on inline SVG icons. Here are some of the reasons why using inline SVG is cool: SVG code is just markup, and with a title and desc element to add meaningful context, both search engines and assistive technologies can access it. You can step up the accessibility of your inline SVG graphics by following these tips by Léonie Watson on SitePoint and Heather Migliorisi on CSS-Tricks. SVG graphics are scalable by definition and resolution-independent, which means they look awesome no matter how much users zoom in on them. Inline SVG graphics don’t require extra HTTP requests to be displayed, which is great for website performance. You can fine-tune the appearance and behavior of inline SVG graphics using CSS and JavaScript, including animating single portions of your artworks and even dynamically morphing their shapes. To learn more about SVG animation techniques, have a read of Animating with Inline SVG by Jordan Wade. In contrast to icon fonts, your website will never fail to load inline SVG icons because the SVG code is already in the HTML document. One more piece of good news is that inline SVG has great browser support; only IE8 lacks support for inline SVG. Icon Fonts Although not suitable for displaying a logo, icon fonts have enjoyed popularity as a great way of displaying icons on a website. The ease of use made possible by online icon libraries like Glyphicons and Font Awesome has greatly contributed to the massive presence of icon fonts on the web. Icon fonts are just text, therefore you can control their appearance with CSS and users can resize them to their liking. For meaningful icons without accompanying text, you can add accessible information using WAI-ARIA techniques. For example, let’s say you are using Font Awesome to display a linked hamburger icon to reveal a hidden menu. Adding just the markup for the icon makes it totally invisible or meaningless to screen readers: <a href="#" class="fa fa-bars"></a> Adding a title attribute to the link works for screen readers, but has the side effect of showing a sometimes undesirable tooltip to users navigating the website without assistive technologies. The aria-label attribute makes the hamburger icon font accessible to screen readers and gets rid of the unwanted tooltip: <a href="#" class="fa fa-bars" aria-label="Menu"></a> However, as Alex Walker and Seren Davies have pointed out, implementing icon fonts on the web has a number of pitfalls, of which you need to be fully aware. To learn more about what it takes to tackle the accessibility issues that come with using icon fonts, Bulletproof Accessible Icon Fonts by Zach Leatherman from the Filament Group is an eye-opener. The <img> Tag Displaying the image of a logo using an <img> tag with a suitable alt attribute is an acceptable and widely used approach. The alt attribute contains the text, thereby taking care of accessibility concerns, the <img> element pulls a fancy graphical representation of the text into the document for display. Both the W3C, their Web Accessibility Tutorials, and Google Webmasters endorse this method. A few small downsides you need to consider are: One more http request, which can impact on the website’s load time. This will become less of an issue in the near future, when HTTP/2 is fully implemented. Separation of concerns is disregarded: if you decide to change the text’s appearance you’ll have to do so by changing the markup, not the CSS. Raster images can look pixelated when users increase their size, although SVG graphics don’t present this issue. The points above have been among the motivations leading up to the various image replacement techniques so widely used in the past. But, why are those techniques frowned upon today? Are we truly done with them? The Case Against Image Replacement Most of the research material about image replacement techniques I’ve come across online dates back to the early or mid 2000s. In November 2013, the HTML5 Boilerplate dropped all kinds of CSS image replacement techniques. These are significant clues suggesting that image replacement is well on its way to being deprecated. CSS allows you to do stuff you could only do on image editing software until just a few years ago. On top of this, with web fonts and vector graphics readily available, why would you reach out for such a clever hack as image replacement? Other important considerations against using image replacement techniques concern their potential negative impact on search engine rankings. Google has clear guidelines against hiding text on webpages, and disregarding them could lead to severe penalties. Here’s what Google’s website considers suspicious ways of hiding text in this day and age on the web: Using white text on a white background. Locating text behind an image. Using CSS to position text off-screen. Setting the font size to 0. Items in the list above figure into most of the popular image replacement techniques, which makes us all wary of using them. However, the situation is not clear-cut. Google points out that hidden text “to manipulate Google’s search rankings [emphasis is mine] can be seen as deceptive and is a violation of Google’s Webmaster Guidelines.” Furthermore, Google goes on by saying that: “… not all hidden text is considered deceptive. For example, if your site includes technologies that search engines have difficulty accessing, like JavaScript, images, or Flash files, using descriptive text for these items can improve the accessibility of your site.” As long as there is no keyword stuffing or malicious intent, image replacement could be considered in compliance with Google’s guidelines. How to communicate your good faith to Google bots is not straightforward, but a good suggestion SEO experts have put forward is to make sure the text you’re hiding is exactly the same as the text displayed on your website. That’s not all. Joost de Valk from Yoast, certainly an authoritative voice in the field of SEO, is among the supporters of image replacement, especially as an accessible way of using sprites on a website. In his CSS Image Replacement, what’s up Matt?, de Valk takes issue with Matt Cutts, Software Engineer at Google, on the latter’s stance against the use of image replacement. You would say de Valk’s piece dates back to 2009, prehistory in the world of web design. Yet, at least to my knowledge, its author hasn’t written anything which could let us think that he has changed his mind on the subject, and at the time of writing this article, the logo on the Yoast website is still being displayed using image replacement. Image replacement is still acceptable from the accessibility perspective, at least in a few cases. This is not surprising since the main drive behind these methods has been that of making possible the display of aesthetically polished but fully accessible textual content on the web. A note by the W3C Working Group explicitly endorses image replacement techniques as long as users can easily switch to an alternate, text-only presentation of the same content in case the implementation should not work as expected. Software developer Logan Franken makes a reasonable case for a limited use of image replacement techniques even today, arguing that they can still play a part when displaying SVG in an img tag or icon fonts without accompanying text on websites. Finally, you will find that image replacement can still be relevant to improve the accessibility of cutting-edge SVG technology today. In the section entitled Example 5: Linked Icon, with dynamic text in Accessible SVGs, Heather Migliorisi points out that the use of the aria-label attribute, while appropriate when the link text accompanying an inline SVG icon is static, does not cater for those situations in which the link text is not known in advance because it gets dynamically added to the page. Migliorisi shows how image replacement can fruitfully be used here to save the day. Conclusion More from this author Animating the DOM with Anime.js Getting to Know Cutestrap, a Lightweight CSS Framework In this article I’ve listed the tools and best practices you can use right now as an alternative to the image replacement techniques so popular in days gone by. These include custom fonts, CSS3 and inline SVG, which were not readily available or well supported by browsers in the past, as well as the good old <img> tag with an appropriate alt attribute. Today, image replacement looks fairly hacky and Google’s stance on hidden text doesn’t encourage its use. However, there are edge cases, mostly involving accessibility considerations, when image replacement techniques can still find limited application, hopefully not for long. What do you make of it, is image replacement dead or alive? Let me hear from you in the comments!

Conveniently ahead of the iPhone 7’s arrival, Google yesterday moved to assuage some of the concerns of users who have been craving for 3D Touch in the app, releasing a small update which enables some interesting shortcuts on the Home screen. Assuming you’re logged in, pressing YouTube’s icon with 3D Touch will produce a shortcuts menu with the following options: Search, Subscriptions and Create. As you may have guessed, selection Search launches the app right into the search feature, with the keyboard already up so you can instantly start trying. If you want to go to the Subscriptions tab to quickly see the new videos from channels you follow, select Subscriptions on the Home screen. And lastly, the Create option launches the app in camera mode so you can immediately start shooting your next big hit on YouTube. This is all pretty basic as YouTube does not make any use of Peek and Pop within the app, but it’s a start I guess.  As a bonus, iOS 10 users will also see a fourth option to share the app with friends and family (yes, iOS 10 puts that option in the shortcuts menu for each and every app on your device). You need YouTube 11.35 for iOS to use these 3D Touch shortcuts, available at no charge in the App Store.

Competition in the budget phone space has never been tougher, and the Moto G4 Play falls far short of the mark. Competition in the budget phone space has never been tougher, and the Moto G4 Play falls far short of the mark. Highs Compact Almost stock Android Lows Occasional stutters in performance No Moto features Camera quality is subpar Cheap, generic look DT Editors' Rating 4.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Phone Reviews > Lenovo Moto G4 Play review By Julian Chokkattu Posted on 09.15.16 Research Center: Lenovo Moto G4 Play Google’s Android motto for the past year or so has been “Be together. Not the same.” Under Lenovo, Motorola may have lost the memo because there’s not much distinguishing the Moto G4 Play from a Nexus, at least on the software side. That hardly means we’re complaining about having stock Android on a device that’s not a part of Google’s Nexus lineup. But when comparing the G4 Play to its predecessor, the 2016 variant feels like an afterthought — a step back after what the Moto G 2015 offered for a budget device. Lenovo has removed the features that make Moto phones unique, from the inside out. The new Moto G4 Play leaves us with a phone that offers no compelling features, just a low price tag. Let’s take a closer look. Random stutters, low performance The Moto G line kicked off in 2013 and brought new meaning to the term “budget phone.” It continued to deliver solid performance and design for a low price in 2014 and 2015. This year marks the first when the Moto G line was split into three smartphones — the Moto G4, Moto G4 Plus, and the Moto G4 Play. It mimics the lineup of Motorola’s flagship Moto Z line. The Moto G4 and the Plus are slightly more expensive than their predecessor, and they offer better specs than the Play. The G4 Play is the runt of the litter and is $30 cheaper than the 1GB RAM variant of the Moto G 2015. Still, it has more in common with it than its bigger brothers. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends It shares the same 5-inch LCD screen with a resolution of 1,280 x 720 pixels. It’s powered by the same processor in the Moto G 2015 — Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 410, but it comes with one option of 2GB RAM. You’ll find it loaded with 16GB of internal storage, and there’s a MicroSD card slot that lets you bump the capacity to more than 256GB. The 720p display is no problem — the device’s size allows it to have a lower resolution than you need. And it’s nice that Lenovo has one Moto G4 that’s not 5.5-inches for people who prefer smaller phones. It’s unclear why smartphone manufacturers continuously offer weaker specs in smaller devices, though. There’s also only one speaker on the front of the device. It doesn’t get as loud as we’d like, but it’s not as bad as devices like the Google Nexus 5X, where sound is hardly audible. It’s nice that Lenovo has one Moto G4 that’s not 5.5-inches for people who prefer smaller phones, Performance is a little tricky on the G4 Play. We ran a few benchmark tests and the device actually performed the same, if not worse, than the 2015 Moto G. It’s very rare for old hardware to outperform the new, but that is the case here. 3DMark Sling Shot using ES 3.0 gave the device a score of 53 — that’s one point less than the Moto G 2015. In comparison, the Moto G4 Plus got a score of 384. Using GeekBench’s app, the Moto G4 Play received a single-core score of 503 and a multi-core score of 1,267. That’s worse on both accounts compared to the 2015 version, which received 512 and 1,283 respectively. And when comparing with AnTuTu Benchmark, the G4 Play earned a score of 28,393. That’s almost half of what Meizu’s M3 Note received, and that phone happens to cost the same price. These numbers paint a pretty bleak picture, but benchmarks are one thing — how’s real world performance? Upon immediately setting up the phone, we were greeted to random stutters and lag while moving between Google Now and the home screen, and when scrolling through apps and widgets. Related: Moto G4 Plus review This stutter is mainly present when you wake the device after some periods of inactivity, but for the most part we have yet to encounter any real performance issues. Apps and the camera open quickly, and we haven’t had much trouble playing somewhat graphically intensive games like Badland 2, Asphalt 8: Airborne, and Dead Trigger 2. It’s unclear what’s causing the stutters then, but they’re not frequent and have not impacted our day-to-day usage with the G4 Play so far. Regardless, do not expect flawless performance — especially when you’re swapping through multiple apps. The 2015 Moto G with 2GB RAM suffered sluggish performance and app freezes when multi-tasking after several months of use. If you’re a heavy user looking for a budget-priced phone, go for the Moto G4 Plus as it offers more processing power. The G4 Play is a weak budget phone in a tough market filled with $200-$300 phones that offer far superior performance and power. Where’s the ergonomic design? Moto Actions? Previous Moto G smartphones featured a slightly curved back that offered better ergonomics. The Moto G 2015, for example, felt more at home in the hand thanks to the curved back. That’s gone in the Moto G4 Play. While the device certainly looks a little more professional, it’s also a bit boring. The front has relatively large bezels on all four sides, but the back looks sleek. It carries the famous Motorola dimple at the center, and a camera and flash above it. There’s a metal frame around the device for some added protection. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends The back certainly makes the phone feel cheap, though, as it’s a plastic, textured back. It can be removed, like previous Moto G phones, and you’ll find a removable battery underneath. Thanks to the plastic back and the 5-inch size, the device is quite light at 137 grams. There’s nothing really unique that stands out from the phone. Save for the Motorola dimple on the back, the G4 Play looks like your run-of-the-mill budget smartphone. It’s not bad, but it’s not exciting. It’s odd complaining about design for a phone that only costs $150, but for $30 more in 2015 the Moto G did have something unique. The G4 Play is a weak budget phone in a tough market filled with phones that offer far superior performance.. Foregoing the ergonomic design, the Moto G 2015 was IPX7 rated, meaning you could keep it submerged underwater for 30 minutes up to 1 meter. The Moto G4 Play can’t do that, so stay away from water. The device also runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with almost zero bloatware. The Moto G4 Play is as close to stock Android as you can get without owning a Nexus, and that’s a good thing. Oddly, there are no Moto Actions that many have come to enjoy on their devices, such as double twist to launch the camera and a double chop to turn on the flash. These software tricks are available on the G4 and G4 Plus. The G4 Play only has Moto Display, which lets you see notifications at a glance on the screen, and a feature that makes using the device easier with one hand. The Moto G4 Play isn’t available via Moto Maker, Motorola’s customization tool, either. The Moto G 2015, and the new G4 and G4 Plus are customizable — you can change the color trim, the back color, add an engraving, and more. One note about the operating system — the Moto G4 Play launched after Android 7.0 Nougat did. The new Android version has been in beta for the past six months, so it’s unclear why Lenovo, which hardly has any additional software layered over Android on its Moto line, would need more time to roll an update to its devices. The G4 Play should have come shipped with the new Android flavor. Low-detailed images The camera isn’t doing the Moto G4 Play any favors, either. The good news is that the camera app snaps pictures quickly and in great lighting conditions, photos look good. Unfortunately, in any other scenario they’re grainy, blurry, and out of focus. Anything with movement will most likely come out blurry unless you’re in direct sunlight. And as for photos in good outdoor lighting — as soon as you zoom in, you can see that images are not sharp, which is likely thanks to the 8-megapixel camera on the rear. The front-camera has 5-megapixels. Most of the G4 Play’s competitors have far better cameras, and both the G4 and the G4 Plus produce superior photos. ZTE’s ZMax Pro costs $50 less at just $100 and it has a 13-megapixel camera that blows the G4 Play’s camera out of the water. Granted, it’s only available on MetroPCS. The Moto G4 Play’s camera will get you by, but stay far away from this phone if that’s a priority. It’s one of the most disappointing features on the phone. Battery A 2,800mAh battery may seem big enough to keep a 5-inch, 720p device powered on for a while, but you can only expect a day’s use with the Moto G4 Play. After a moderate day of use, we returned home with under 25 percent battery. Again, if you’re a power user — go for the Plus or one of the many other budget devices available in this price range. Most phones can at least manage a day and a half before conking out, especially when the screen is under 1080p resolution. Lenovo Moto G4 Play Compared To HTC Bolt Meizu Pro 6 LG X Power Apple iPhone 7 ZTE ZMax Pro Lenovo Moto Z Alcatel Idol 4S Meizu M3 Note Moto G4 Plus Oppo F1 Plus Samsung Galaxy S7 Active HTC 10 Apple iPhone SE LG G5 Nextbit Robin Warranty information and software updates Motorola offers a standard one-year warranty for the Moto G4 Play. This covers any damage that occurs as a result of a manufacturing defect. If you’re in need of extra protection for your device, the company does offer Motorola Care Accidental Protection, which includes coverage over accidental damage such as water damage and shattered screens. It costs $70 for 15 months, or $100 for 24 months. In terms of Android updates, Motorola is one of the better manufacturers, so it’s likely the Moto G4 lineup will get Android 7.0 Nougat soon. However, since Lenovo bought the Moto brand, the updates may not be quite as snappy. Conclusion The DT Accessory Pack Moto G4 Play Case $5.99 Motorola Moto 360 $349.99 Samsung EVO Select Micro SDXC Memory Card $199.99 For $180, last year’s Moto G offered an ergonomic design, IPX7 waterproof rating, Moto Maker, and Moto Actions, It didn’t feel like a budget device, bar the occasional performance hiccup. You might have expected the new Moto G4 Play to continue on this path toward greatness, but instead it regresses. The Moto G4 Play does feel like a budget device and for $150, it feels as though more features were stripped away than necessary. There’s always the Amazon Prime-exclusive route, where you can get the device for $100 with lock screen ads and offers. But even at that price, you’re better off buying the ZTE ZMax Pro, which costs $100 after a rebate on MetroPCS, has far better specs, and no ads. The Moto G4 Play is hard to recommend when just $50 more can get you a much more powerful devices with better specs overall. You won’t have to worry about the device handling strenuous tasks if you cough up a little extra dough for devices like the Moto G4 and Plus, the Huawei Honor 5X, Alcatel’s OneTouch Idol 3, or ZTE’s ZMax Pro. Competition in the budget phone space has never been tougher, and the Moto G4 Play falls short of the mark.

Well, if you happen to have a Chromecast lying around, Google’s new program has your name written all over it. It is called the Chromecast Preview Program which is an ongoing, opt-in feature that lets you test new software ahead of public release. The benefits of the Chromecast Preview Program are myriad, Google explained on the program’s support page. Not only does it afford you the opportunity to “test drive [new] features,” but it provides enrollees the chance to “give early feedback” and “stay up to date” with the latest software. Lest you be concerned about those experiments’ impact on the stability of your Chromecast, though, Google assured that the software is a bit less bug-prone than your typical beta. “Our intention is that … updates will be of the same quality as production version updates,” Google said. “You’re simply getting early access to new features before they’re released broadly.” Related: Google dives into multiroom sound with the new Chromecast Audio Chromecast, for the uninitiated, is a diminutive dongle that you plug into the back of a television, projector, or any other device with a spare HDMI port. It connects to your local Wi-Fi, cellular, or Ethernet-based network and lets you stream content from hundreds of sources. That’s no exaggeration — Hulu’s among the list of more than 10,000 apps that support Google’s streaming platform, as are Spotify, Netflix, Pandora, iHeartRadio, YouTube, and Twitch. But that is just the tip of Chromecast’s functionality iceberg: the versatile Chromecast supports the streaming of local content like photos and videos, too, plus games like Just Dance Now and Angry Birds Friends. And on supported smartphones, tablets, and computers, you can even mirror your device’s content. It has been a resounding success. As of late July, Google’s sold more than 30 million Chromecast units, besting both the Apple TV and Roku’s latest boxes for 35 percent of the total streaming device market. And that momentum is likely to grow. The company partnered with Vizio to tie Chromecast functionality tightly into its current and future lines of TV. Google also debuted a new version of the Chrome browser with Chromecast software built in and will reportedly release a new Chromecast model in the coming weeks with support for 4K video. Opting into the Chromecast Preview Program is a relatively straightforward affair, as the support page explains. Open the companion Cast app for Chromecast, tap the Devices tab, select the Device Settings button from the drop-down menu, and you will see an entry for the Preview Program. From there, you have the option of enrolling and the chance to sign up for email notifications every time new preview firmware is released. Related: Everything you need to know about the ridiculously affordable Google Chromecast Both the first and second generation of Chromecast devices are eligible for the Preview Program, as is Chromecast audio, the audio-only streaming device for audio receivers and standalone speakers. It is not the first public beta program Google has rolled out in recent months. In May, the search giant launched the Android Beta Program, a public test that granted intrepid users ongoing access to newer, unpolished builds of the company’s mobile operating system.

Speaking in the Sky debate, Smith, who is challenging Corbyn for the leadership, criticised Corbyn’s team for releasing a list singling out 13 Labour MPs it claims have abused the leader and his allies. Smith said this suggested that Corbyn was planning to get his opponents deselected if he won. He told Corbyn: You talk about trying to unite the party. I find that quite hard to reconcile with something your campaign did just this evening, which was publish a list, a deselection list if you like, of the 13 MPs, including the deputy leader of our party, Tom Watson, who your campaign think have transgressed against you in criticising you. That isn’t unifying. That is deeply divisive, and frankly, it’s where you began the contest by talking about deselection in your opening speech. If that’s what you are intending to do when if win this election, to deselect all our MPs, then we will be in even greater trouble than we are in right now ... It does feel like setting Momentum onto them to try and get them deselected. Corbyn said that was not what the list was about. But Smith said that was how it would be seen by MPs. Corbyn also defended the list, saying: There was information put out there which is statements that colleagues made on the record and it’s all stuff that is out there on the public record. His comment contrasted with briefing from his team earlier in the evening saying the list of names should not have been released. Smith has accused Corbyn of not knowing how many seats Labour needs to gain to form a government. Corbyn replied “at least 90”, but Smith said that the number was 106 and that Corbyn should know this. Corbyn said the actual figure depended on boundary changes. Labour has 230 seats in the House of Commons and the Conservatives 329, a working majority of 16. Smith was quoting a figure from this Fabian Society research. The Fabian Society (@thefabians) Fabian analysis shows we need to win 106 seats to gain a majority in 2020 @andrew_harrop #fabtea - See the report http://t.co/5m5lJQw90r July 14, 2015 Smith accused Corbyn of not being straight about what he said about triggering article 50 on the morning after the EU referendum. Asked why he had said it had to be triggered now, Corbyn said that article 50 did have to be invoked. He was not necessarily saying at that moment, he implied. But Smith told him: Jeremy says he wants straight talking, honest politics. Jeremy, I watched that interview. You did say ‘Let’s trigger article 50 now’ and I think the country saw you say it. And it’s unfortunate you should now seek to row back on that. That’s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments.

And, on that basis, tonight’s hustings will confirm the impression that Jeremy Corbyn is the clear favourite. Owen Smith attacked him repeatedly. By contrast, Corbyn mostly responded with serene indifference. At Westminster he is widely expected to win quite comfortably and, judging by his demeanour, and the reaction of the studio audience (supposedly 50/50, but in the event much more vocal in support of Corbyn), that forecast seems reasonable. On a clapometer test Corbyn would have won quite easily, and some of his answers denouncing the government were effective. But when he and Smith argued with each other on specific points, rather rather than just respond to audience questions, Smith tended to get the better of the exchanges. His “how many seats does Labour need to gain to win the election” challenge was a bit too contrived, and Corbyn had a reasonable response, but it did make Corbyn look uncomfortable. Smith was more successful when he accused Corbyn (rightly) of being disingenuous about what he said about article 50 on 24 June, when he criticised Corbyn for trying to laugh off the claim that he condoned booing (as Corbyn had been doing) and when he challenged Corbyn over his response to the treatment of Ruth Smeeth at the Chakrabarti report launch. Smith also “won” the exchange over the naming of 13 anti-Corbyn MPs by the Corbyn team tonight, and what he said about how this fuelled fears that MPs will be deselected may be the best news line of the night. If this were a boxing match, with points awards for successful blows on target, Smith would have won. But the audience did not seem to view it like that, and Smith’s performance is unlikely to change the minds of many in an electorate that has probably mostly voted already anyway. One other point should concern team Corbyn just a little. There was an interesting moment when Faisal Islam asked a woman in the audience to explain why she was booing. She launched into an epic rant about Tony Blair, only for Islam to point out that the Blair government passed the anti grammar school expansion law everyone had just been supporting. Undeterred, she reverted back to diatribe mode. Corbyn believes he can appeal to the mainstream, but his critics claim he appeals mostly to far-left obsessives and, rightly or wrongly, this vignette will make them think they’re right. Updated at 5.49pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.57pm EDT 16:57 Corbyn and Smith are making closing statements now. Smith says the Tories have been in power for six years. They are pursuing rightwing policies. He says this is not about the individuals. This is about putting Labour back in power. That is what he can do. Corbyn says the government has ideological obsessions. He is totally opposed to that ideology. He was elected Labour leader to take the party in a slightly different direction. When the PLP and the leadership have worked together, they have achieved victories. They have forced the government to make over 20 U-turns. They have won elections. After the contest Labour must come together, he says. It must be a part for investment, and for ensuring that no community is every left behind. Corbyn gets big round of applause. And that’s it. I will post a verdict, summary and reaction soon.

Yes, says Smith. But he says he is opposed to Donald Trump. Corbyn launches a tirade against Trump, describing him as objectionable. Q: But you could have a conversation with him on things like TTIP? Corbyn says he could have a conversation with anyone. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.51pm EDT 16:51 Smith accuses Corbyn of not doing enough to tackle antisemitism. Corbyn rejects this. He says some of the complaints about antisemitism in the party predated his leadership. He set up the Shami Chakrabarti inquiry, he says. What more could he have done? Smith says that at the launch of the Chakrabarti report, the Labour MP Ruth Smeeth received antisemitic abuse. But Corbyn was then seen talking to the person who abused her afterwards. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.49pm EDT 16:49 Antisemitism Q: [To Corbyn] Can you condemn antisemitism, without using the phrase “other forms of racism”. Corbyn says antisemitism is not just about using offensive language. It has been rife for a long time. Read what George Orwell said about it, he says. Perhaps Corbyn has been reading Michael White’s Twitter feed. This is from earlier this evening. MichaelWhite (@michaelwhite) Just now read Orwell essay (1945) on English anti semitism. Thanks.

Don’t you accept that outside London people think differently about the EU? Smith says there were places like Manchester, outside London, that voted for staying in the EU. Q: At a Labour First meeting there were some very offensive tweets coming out. How can you get unity when people behave like that? Smith says he does not know anything about that meeting. But he says this event tonight has shown how some of Corbyn’s supporters can get angry. He says people need to calm down a bit. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.42pm EDT 16:42 Someone in the audience shouts at Smith, saying he should get behind his leader. Corbyn never did, Smith says. Corbyn says he was in parliament under Blair. He says he voted for all the good things the Blair government did that Smith cited. But he opposed Blair on human rights issues and on wars. Q: Why don’t you oppose the booing [to Corbyn]? Corbyn says he urges people to be polite. But sometimes it takes a while for the message to get through. Smith accuses Corbyn of trying to laugh this off. Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith Photograph: Sky Updated at 4.48pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.40pm EDT 16:40 Grammar schools Q: What are the benefits of grammar schools? Corbyn says he attended a grammar school. A grammar school education provides a great deal of support for pupils. They are under pressure to achieve. His objection is that it involves testing children at 11. It becomes a life-affecting decision. Those who fail are told they are not so special. He wants all children to be educated together. Children should not be divided at all. He says he has got “more than half a feeling” that the Tories will drop their grammar school plans as “completely unworkable”. Corbyn says he expect the Tories to abandon their grammar school expansion plans as “completely unworkable”. Smith says he went to a comprehensive. He is a big supporter of comprehensives. His wife is a teacher. He says his dad went to a grammar school. But many of his dad’s friends failed from that system. It would be “completely regressive” to go back to that. He says that he is concerned that Corbyn is too happy being in opposition. Labour needs to be in power to change the law. Some members of the audience boo. Faisal Islam challenges one of the woman booing. She says she is so angry with the Labour party. They want to go back to Tony Blair, she says. Everyone hates Blair, she says. Islam points out that the Blair government passed the rule saying no more grammar schools could be opened. He may had done that, she says. But other things he did was bad. Smith says the Blair government did lots of good things, like the minimum wage. He is to the left of Blair, he says. But Labour is a movement. Updated at 6.58pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.34pm EDT 16:34 Corbyn says the government is handing public services over the private sector. That should stop, he says. Smith says he is a centre-left politician. That is where Labour fights elections and wins, he says. He says he is worried that people around Corbyn are associated with the hard left. That means Labour will be associated with the hard left. And there is a danger the Tories could move into Labour’s territory. He says May’s speech at the start of the summer suggested they might do this. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.31pm EDT 16:31 Smith says it is hard to reconcile what Corbyn says about unity with the decision to release the list attacking 13 Labour MPs, including Tom Watson. (See 8.54pm.) Corbyn says the list was just a statement of things that have been said in public. He says this will be seen as a move towards deselecting MPs. Smith says release of list of critical MPs by Corbyn’s team suggest Corbyn’s critics are facing deselection. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.28pm EDT 16:28 Q: So why are your poll ratings so bad? Corbyn says he is putting his message out as best he can. He predicts that Labour will defeat the Tories on grammar schools. He says the message will get through. Smith says he does not think Corbyn is serious. Does he know how many seats Labour needs to win to win the election. At least 90, says Corbyn. It is 106, says Smith. Corbyn and Smith disagree about how to gain power Photograph: Sky That depends on the boundaries, says Corbyn. Smith says this figure should be tattooed on Corbyn’s head. He says we are all in favour of motherhood and apple pie. But politics is a tough business, he says. Corbyn says it is regrettable if Smith reduces this to an issue about personalities. He says Labour was created by brave people. Labour can do great things if it sticks together. Corbyn says Labour leadership should not be turned into an argument about personality.

Smith says he would say he would invest in public services. And Labour has to seize back words like “ambition” and “aspiration” from the Tories. How did Labour cede those words to the Tories. And Labour has to “get away from the notion that we are somehow anti-business”, he says. Smith says Labour must quash idea it is anti-business. Q: Why do you think you are more electable? Smith says the polls suggest this. And he says his record of campaigning shows he can take on the Tories. And he came into the Commons aged 40. He had done three big jobs before becoming an MP, in the public and private sector. And that includes working for a big pharmaceutical firm, he says. Corbyn says the country needs more investment. So it needs to reach out to people, promising investment and more council houses. People might think they are okay. But are they happy seeing people sleeping on the streets, and the NHS being privatised. He says we will be “even more divided” if there is another Tory government. We cannot afford more of this “grotesque inequality”. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.19pm EDT 16:19 Leave voters Q: How would you win support from leave voters? Corbyn says most Labour members voted to remain. But some did not. There was a split, he says. Former mining areas, in particular, voted leave. Areas with low wages voted out. Labour has to reach out to every community, by for example stressing the need for a living wage, investment in infrastructure, investment in housing. There is no future if we just blame minorities and migrants for our problems, he says. The government must invest. This gets a large round of applause. Smith says the referendum was finely balanced. Many areas voted out because they have felt a sense of loss and decline. The antidote is a Labour government. But Labour is not coming back in Scotland, he says. It has gone from second to third under Corbyn. To give hope to those communities, Labour must look like a competent, credible government. There is some applause for this, but the odd boo too. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.15pm EDT 16:15 Q: What would you say to Japan, that has issued a list of Brexit demands? Corbyn says retaining access to the single market is vital for businesses like that. And travel arrangements are important too, he says. He does not want a hard border. This would harm the 2m Britons working abroad. Jeremy Corbyn Photograph: Sky Smith says he is going to Scotland and Wales tomorrow highlighting the number of jobs at risk.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search How to present a Google Pixel phone (to beat the iPhone 7) Chris Burns - Sep 14, 2016 22 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The following is a presentation of the Google Pixel phone and the Google Pixel XL, two devices that will seal Google’s destiny in hardware. To be entirely clear up front, this presentation is a suggestion for Google – a mock-up of how I imagine Google might present their first set of true iPhone competitor devices. With the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus having already been revealed with some easy-to-pick-on features and Samsung’s biggest-fiasco-ever currently fresh in users’ minds, Google has a BIG opportunity right here and now. Lots of information about both Google Pixel devices has been spilled early. These replacements for Google’s Nexus smartphone line have been seen from several angles and specifications have been leaked in excess. For more information on these devices as we know them today, have a peek at our timeline of Pixel-related writings at the end of this article. Above and below you’ll see a number of photos captured by SlashGear and modified where applicable. These photos come from events from several different companies, and none should be seen as any sort of real association with the hypothetical presentation we’ve created here. Renderings of the smaller device come from Android Authority and OnLeaks. Hello everyone, thanks for coming out today – and Happy Halloween! Today we have something very special to show you – two devices, actually, both of them part of a future vision Google has been working towards for a long time. This vision is one in which smart device users – everyone – will be able to simplify their lives at the same time as they enrich their lives with Google. This month marks the seventh anniversary of the original launch of Android. Since then a lot has changed. Smartphones have become an integral part of our lives, and these machines have changed the way we work, play, and live. As such, we’ve created a set of smart devices that work within a system that allows its user to have a smarter and more enriched life. The first thing we’re going to show you today is a device we’re really excited about. This is the Pixel. It’s a smartphone, but it’s not the same as any smartphone you’ve used before. This is the always-current central controller of your elevated life experience. First – it’ll have everything that our previous line of developer-aimed smartphones had. That means Google support. It means updates being sent out the same day each new version of our operating system is announced. In addition, it now means that every Pixel user will have a device they can count on having current software with for four full years. Starting at launch, Google will be supporting every Pixel device for the next four years with software updates – guaranteed. The Pixel experience is one of passive interaction as well as high-powered processing when a user needs to do work or play games. As such, we’ve created a new high-powered processor to handle anything any user will be able to throw at the Pixel. This is the GX-1. The G-1 processor was created with our friends at Qualcomm – specialists in mobile processors for the vast majority of the smartphones released since the birth of the mobile phone. We’ve created a processor here that’s two times as powerful as the chip inside the Nexus 6P. It’s ready to take on anything. And it’s fully prepared to work in concert with all manner of future-ready connectivity like 5Ghz Wi-Fi and 4G LTE and 5G network speeds on all networks both inside and outside of the United States. The Pixel sports a display that’s better than any screen we’ve ever seen on a smartphone before. Not just because its sharp and its colors are brilliant, but because it brings these things to the user without sacrificing battery life. While the Pixel’s battery is small enough to keep the device extremely thin, the processor teams up with the display to keep battery use extremely low. We do this with a new feature we call Pixel-Sync. This device’s display has its own separate smart processing unit that allows it to be most brilliant when it knows you’re using it, then pull back and conserve energy when it sees that you’re not in need of its full-blast color and sharpness. The body of the Pixel includes two front-facing speakers, a reinforced glass front with full-frame coverage, and a backside which you will be able to custom-order, use, and replace at will. Users will be able to pick from a collection of fine metals, soft or hard plastic, wood, reinforced glass, or ceramic. And that’s just for starters. True to Google’s history working with open-source software and a wide variety of hardware manufacturers, we’ll be allowing back panels for the Pixel to be made by anyone. Our design for the back panel on this device will be made available for 3D modeling today – free and open to the public. The camera on the Pixel is not new. It has one sensor, one lens. It doesn’t feature any wacky or off-the-wall ideas to make taking photos more interesting. Instead of what our competitors are doing, we’ve decided to combine the best camera technology in the world with the best smartphone camera lens ever created. This camera can shoot photos and capture video with more intense high-level professional quality than any smartphone camera that’s come before it. It’s that simple. What’s also simple about this device is how it’ll open the door to your future. The Pixel is the key to your next-generation smart home – and smart environment outside the home as well. The Pixel comes with the newest version of Google On installed right out of the box. Google has worked with parters from around the world to create a new wave of smart home and smart world products with Google On connectivity – all launching over the next few months. With the Pixel, users will be able to control any and all electronic devices in their home. They’ll also be greeted by smart connected Google On devices in major stores, coffee shops, nightclubs, bus stops, newsstands, restaurants, and a whole lot more. The sky is the limit when it comes to the immediate fully-interactive future of Google On and Pixel. And that’s it! This device will be made available later today on pre-order and will be available in a variety of stores this Friday. *Phone rings* Sorry about that folks, I have this Pixel set so it only rings when a very select set of people call. *Takes phone out* Oh you might all want to see this. *Places phone on projector so it can be seen on the big screen on stage* “Hello everyone, this is Steve Wozniak. The team that built the Pixel at Google here told me they’d only release a bigger version of the thing if I called in, so I called in.” Thanks Steve. Yes, we will indeed be releasing a bigger version of the Pixel too, just for you. We might even put it on sale for everyone else, too. We’re calling it the Google Pixel Plus Epic Evo 4G LTE Touch. “How about you just keep it simple and call it Pixel XL.” We’ll think about it. Thanks for calling in, Steve. “No problem. I’ll come in to pick up my XL later today.” OK folks so we’ve got the Pixel and the Pixel XL, both with the same abilities, both ready to be customized for each individual user. We’re going to make both devices available for pre-order today, while shipping begins tomorrow, and in-store availability begins Friday. Sound good? Alright then. Thanks again everyone! NOTE: Previously reported information states that the actual real-life event for these devices will take place some time inside October of 2016. Not too far away!

The winning masterpiece will then adorn the Google homepage for a day for millions of people to enjoy. This year’s theme is “What I see for the future…” and that means anything they see for the future -- even if it includes flying dogs, living on a shooting star, or just a great trip with their family.   Parents, teachers, non-profits and after school programs are welcome to enter artwork on behalf of students K-12. When teachers and after school programs enter doodles on behalf of their students, the entry form must be signed by each student's parent or guardian. Teachers can enter multiple doodles at one time. This year’s contest is going to be one for the record books; the future and the ways to depict it are limitless. That’s why we’ll have an all-star group of judges including our very own Google Doodlers help select the National Winner. In addition to the homepage showcase, the winner will receive $30,000 towards a college scholarship, and the opportunity to work with the Doodle team at the Googleplex in Mountain View. As an added bonus: Their home school will get to spend $50,000 on technology to help foster the next generation of professionals (and who knows, maybe future Googlers, too!). As you may remember, last year’s Oklahoma winner was Kataleena Bandasack, a fifth grader from Owasso. More information, including all contest rules, are available at https://doodles.google.com/d4g/how-it-works.html. Submissions are open until December 2. Copyright 2016 KSWO. All rights reserved.

Bill Maris, the former head of Google Ventures, is raising money for his own venture capital fund, according to people familiar with the matter. Maris, who left Alphabet's start-up investing arm in August, has preliminary plans to raise between $350 million and $500 million, though no amount has been set, said the sources, who asked not to be named because his talks with investors are confidential. Despite the weakest tech IPO market since the financial crisis, institutions are pouring money into venture capital funds. U.S. VCs raised over $14 billion in the first quarter, the most in a decade, and followed up with an additional $8.8 billion in the second quarter, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Whether Maris can replicate his Google success operating on his own is the big question limited partners face as they consider putting in money. show chapters <p>Google Ventures&#039; health care investments</p> <p>Bill Maris, Google Ventures managing partner, discusses the firm&#039;s investment in life science and health. </p> Google Ventures' health care investments    Monday, 3 Nov 2014 | 11:36 AM ET | 02:39 Maris started Google Ventures, now known as GV, in 2009 as a way for the internet giant to re-invest in the start-up ecosystem. The firm struck quick success thanks to the Google brand and the ability to give emerging companies valuable resources like cloud-computing infrastructure along with help from specialists in engineering, design and recruiting. Under Maris's leadership, GV made winning bets on Uber, Nest Labs and Jet.com. It also invested in HomeAway, HubSpot and RetailMeNot prior to their initial public offerings and has stakes in Slack, DocuSign and Blue Bottle Coffee. After Theranos's improprieties were uncovered by The Wall Street Journal last year, Maris told Business Insider that a GV life science investor looked at the medical device company and the firm passed because "it wasn't that difficult for anyone to determine that things may not be what they seem here." He told TechCrunch in February that GV opted against backing Zenefits, but made mistakes by not getting into companies including Airbnb, Palantir and Snapchat. Maris's abrupt departure in August came a year after Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin reorganized the company and created Alphabet as the parent, with Page as CEO. GV was slotted into the "other bets" category, which includes brands and units that are removed from Google's core internet business. Autonomous cars, Nest thermostats and the anti-aging division Calico are also in that category. Now that the group "other bets" is broken out in Google's financials, the pressure is on to show returns. That's coincided with some high-profile executive departures. Nest founder Tony Fadell left the company in June and Chris Urmson, the technology chief of Google's self-driving car project, stepped away in August. Lauren Thomas | CNBC The Nest Thermostat, which can be controlled from voice control within the home or from an app outside of the home. Maris didn't respond to a request for comment. He hasn't spoken publicly about his post-GV plans and told The New York Times in an August interview that he intended to spend more time with his wife and then 11-month-old child while working on his next project. Maris started his career investing in biotechnology and healthcare companies for Swedish money management firm Investor AB. During the dot-com boom, he founded web hosting provider Burlee.com, which was eventually sold to Web.com. In addition to building GV up to a vehicle with 300 investments and $2.4 billion under management, he also turned it into a full-service firm inside of Alphabet, populated with professional engineers, recruiters and marketing experts. David Krane, an early Google employee who started as communications director in 2000 and joined GV in 2010, succeeded Maris as the venture arm's CEO.

REUTERS/Vincent Kessler 1/2 left right European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker arrives to address the European Parliament during a debate on The State of the European Union in Strasbourg, France, September 14, 2016. REUTERS/Vincent Kessler 2/2 By Foo Yun Chee and Alissa de Carbonnel | BRUSSELS BRUSSELS European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced measures on Wednesday to rein in the world's technology giants, improve broadband speeds and cut the cost of internet access, trying to rally popular support for an EU battered by Brexit. The reforms are likely to shift some wealth from internet services such as Google and Facebook to European telecom groups, which have largely missed out on the tech sector's surging growth and have lobbied hard for more flexible rules that would give them more money to invest in faster broadband access. They complain that Google, Facebook's WhatsApp, Microsoft's Skype and other services have made billions by piggy-backing on their networks for free. Among the changes, Juncker wants to roll back European Union rules that bar the likes of Deutsche Telekom, Orange and Telefonica from co-investing or sharing network capacity. The Commission would expand rules covering security and confidentiality for phone providers to internet-based communication services. "We propose today to equip every European village and every city with free wireless internet access," Juncker told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, without giving more details of how the EU would help to achieve this goal within the next decade. The plan would also extend the copyright powers of publishers, music artists and other content owners to seek a share of the revenue which internet services make from linking to publishing snippets of content such as news. Juncker said the EU would also help to protect the personal online data of EU citizens through legal framework changes. The Silicon Valley tech giants are accused by European consumer groups of stockpiling users' data for commercial ends. The unveiling of Juncker's reform plan starts what is expected to be a fierce fight among EU lawmakers, member states and industry groups before it can become law. INTERNET SETBACK The plan will add weight to accusations from across the Atlantic that EU measures in recent years to protect competition and privacy and crack down on illegal state aid are targeting the U.S. tech giants unfairly. Critics, including U.S. President Barack Obama, have said the Commission is using tighter regulations against Silicon Valley companies in the hope of creating regional versions of Google or Apple. Last year, Obama dismissed these moves as "commercially driven", taken because European tech firms "can’t compete" with U.S. rivals. The tech industry expressed its displeasure on Wednesday. EDiMA, a trade group backed by top U.S. and European tech firms ranging from Airbnb and Candy Crush game maker King.com to Amazon and Google, called the copyright framework more 1916 than 2016. "It does not reflect the current environment in which users access and consume content online and lacks the ambition called for by most European stakeholders and consumers to realize a Digital Single Market," EDiMA said in a statement. Juncker's plans, highlighted in his annual State of the Union address, will be seen as an effort to counter euroscepticism by showing how technocratic institutions in Brussels can deliver improvements to people's lives. The Commission's broader efforts to create the "digital single market" are seen widely as favoring domestic telecom and media companies. Only eight of the top 100 global tech companies are headquartered in Europe, according to an A.T. Kearney study. Some of Juncker's consumer-friendly measures are also likely to impact the telecom industry, including a plan for free mobile roaming and wireless internet in cities across the EU. In a surprise move this month before the speech, Juncker withdrew proposals to limit the number of days consumers can use their mobile phones abroad without paying extra fees after criticism that the rules favored telecoms firms. He ordered the draft to be revised in what allies and officials said showed the EU executive wanted to be seen to listen to voters three months after Britons opted to leave the bloc. COPYRIGHT STORM Juncker said that the EU would work to defend people's right to privacy, saying: "Europeans do not like drones overhead recording their every move, or companies stockpiling their every mouse click. In Europe privacy matters." His copyright proposal could give publishers more bargaining power with Google when demanding payment from the world's most popular internet search engine. The outlines of this proposal stirred controversy when they were leaked last month but Wednesday's plan provided few specifics. "The creation of content is not a hobby, it is a profession," Juncker said. "As the world goes digital we have also to empower our artists and creators ... I want journalists, publishers and authors to be paid fairly for their work." Google called the plan a backward step for copyright in Europe that would limit its ability to help news publishers generate advertising revenue by sending traffic their way via Google's Google News and Search properties. "After all, paying to display snippets is not a viable option for anyone," Google Vice President for global policy Caroline Atkinson wrote in a blog. The Society of Audiovisual Authors, speaking on behalf of media licensing rights groups, praised elements of the package. However, it said the plan failed to provide an "unwaivable right to remuneration" for European film, TV and multimedia screenwriters and directors to make a living from their works. Benoît Machuel, General Secretary of the International Federation of Musicians, said: "What we need is a right for all performers to be paid each time a performance is used online on iTunes, Netflix or Spotify." Grassroots internet rights groups said the draft proposal to extend copyright for news publishers even to short sections of news repeats the mistakes of laws passed in Germany and Spain, which hurt publishers and internet users alike. "We now have a proposal that is poison for Europeans' free speech, poison for European business and poison for creativity," said Joe McNamee, Executive Director of European Digital Rights. "It could not conceivably be worse." The EU initiatives got a thumbs up from ETNO, the European telecoms operators' association whose members include Orange and Telefonica. "We need to ensure that the new Code (proposal) provides technologically-inclusive incentives, allowing our members to deliver a further increase in broadband investment," ETNO Chairman Steven Tas said. The telecoms industry had already lobbied against the burden of the original proposal of allowing them to charge extra only for clients who use their phones abroad for more than 90 days a year or 30 in a row. The European Consumer Organisation welcomed Juncker's reforms but expressed concerns they would favor dominant market players and do little to lower prices on international calls. "Consumers need operators to compete with one another in the market to deliver innovative services at cheaper prices," its head Monique Goyens said in a statement.

It’s also exploring expansions into Los Angeles, San Diego, Irvine, San Jose, Louisville, Tampa, Jacksonville, Phoenix, Chicago, Dallas, and Portland (Oregon).  Want to read more stories like this?

Among the highlights: GB’s Andy Lapthorne, who enjoyed glory last night in the doubles, takes on Dylan Alcott of Australia in the wheelchair tennis men’s quad singles gold medal match at around 4.30pm local time (8.30pm GMT), Hannah Cockroft, Kare Adenegan & Mel Nicholls go in the women’s T34 400m final a little more than an hour after that and David Weir and Richard Chiassaro compete in men’s T54 800m heats a little later. In total there will have been 59 golds dished out by the time the action concludes.

Juncker highlighted the initiatives in an annual State of the Union address that sought to counter euroscepticism with concrete examples of how technocratic institutions in Brussels can deliver improvements to people's everyday lives. Telecoms firms have been lobbying intensely for more flexible rules allowing them to boost revenue and invest in costly fast broadband to help the bloc catch up with the United States and Asia. The European Commission also proposed reining in internet giants such as Google, Facebook's WhatsApp and Microsoft's Skype by extending telecoms security rules to web-based apps. Its plans, part of a drive to create a "digital single market" in the EU, largely favour incumbent telecom operators and media firms over the technology companies, analysts say. Some of the plans could force tech firms to channel revenues from internet services to their telecoms rivals. Only eight of the top 100 global tech companies are headquartered in Europe, according to a A.T. Kearney study. The unveiling of Juncker's reform plan starts what is expected to be a fierce fight among EU lawmakers, member states and industry groups before it can become law. "When you travel in Europe with your mobile phone, you will be able to feel at home anywhere in Europe thanks to these new roaming rules," Juncker told the European Parliament in Strasbourg. In a surprise move this month before the speech, Juncker withdrew proposals to limit the number of days consumers can use their mobile phones abroad without paying extra fees after criticism that the rules favoured telecoms firms. He ordered the draft to be revised in what allies and officials said showed the EU executive wanted to be seen to listen to voters three months after Britons opted to leave the bloc. COPYRIGHT STORM Juncker also promoted a copyright proposal that could give publishers more bargaining power with Google when demanding payment from the world's most popular internet search engine for displaying snippets of their news. The outlines of this proposal stirred controversy when they were leaked last month but Wednesday's plan provided few specifics. "The creation of content is not a hobby, it is a profession," Juncker said. "As the world goes digital we have also to empower our artists and creators ... I want journalists, publishers and authors to be paid fairly for their work." EDiMA, a trade group backed by top U.S. and European tech firms ranging from Airbnb and Candy Crush game maker King.com to Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, called the copyright framework more 1916 than 2016. "It does not reflect the current environment in which users access and consume content online and lacks the ambition called for by most European stakeholders and consumers to realise a Digital Single Market," EDiMA said in a statement. The Society of Audiovisual Authors, speaking on behalf of media licensing rights groups, praised elements of the package. However, it said the plan failed to provide an "unwaivable right to remuneration" for European film, TV and multimedia screenwriters and directors to make a living from their works. Benoît Machuel, General Secretary of the International Federation of Musicians, said: "What we need is a right for all performers to be paid each time a performance is used online on iTunes, Netflix or Spotify." Grassroots internet rights groups said the draft proposal to extend copyright for news publishers even to short snippets of news repeats the mistakes of laws passed in Germany and Spain, which hurt publishers and internet users alike. "We now have a proposal that is poison for Europeans' free speech, poison for European business and poison for creativity," said Joe McNamee, Executive Director of European Digital Rights. "It could not conceivably be worse." PRIVACY MATTERS Juncker said the EU would also create a legal framework to promote the expansion of high-speed internet and efforts to protect the personal online data of citizens across the bloc. "We propose today to equip every European village and every city with free wireless internet access," Juncker said, without giving more details of how the EU would help to achieve this goal within the next decade. He added that the EU would work to defend people's right to privacy, saying: "Europeans do not like drones overhead recording their every move, or companies stockpiling their every mouse click. In Europe privacy matters." As the EU executive's seeks to reform the bloc's telecoms and copyright industries, it has balanced such populist initiatives with proposals that favoured telecoms operators such as Deutsche Telekom and Orange. The EU initiatives got a thumbs up from ETNO, the European telecoms operators' association whose members include Orange and Telefonica. "We need to ensure that the new Code (proposal) provides technologically-inclusive incentives, allowing our members to deliver a further increase in broadband investment," ETNO Chairman Steven Tas said. The telecoms industry had already lobbied against the burden of the original proposal of allowing them to charge extra only for clients who use their phones abroad for more than 90 days a year or 30 in a row. The European Consumer Organisation welcomed Juncker's reforms but expressed concerns they would favour dominant market players and do little to lower prices on international calls. "Consumers need operators to compete with one another in the market to deliver innovative services at cheaper prices," its head Monique Goyens said in a statement.

The goal of this contest is to find a vulnerability or bug chain that achieves remote code execution on multiple Android devices, knowing only the devices’ phone number and email address.  “Despite the existence of vulnerability rewards programs at Google and other companies, many unique, high-quality security bugs have been discovered as a result of hacking contests,” said Natalie Silvanovich, a Google “exploit enthusiast.” “Hoping to continue the stream of great bugs, we’ve decided to start our own contest.” $200,000 will be awarded to the first winning entry, $100,000 to the second and third places and subsequent winning entries will nab $50,000, awarded by Android Security Rewards, awarded to additional winning entries.  Any bugs that don’t end up being used in a submission will be considered for Android Security Rewards and any other rewards program at Google they might be eligible for after the contest has ended. Android Security Rewards was added to Google’s Vulnerability Rewards Program to focus specifically on exploits and vulnerabilities within Google’s mobile operating system. It was launched to help secure Google’s range of Nexus devices, such as smartphones and tablets.  In addition, participants who submit a winning entry with be invited to write a short technical report on their entry about how their exploit works, which will eventually be published on the Project Zero blog. Every vulnerability and exploit technique used in each winning submission will be made public. “This contest will be structured a bit differently than other contests,” explained Silvanovich, in a blog. “Instead of saving up bugs until there’s an entire bug chain, and then submitting it to the Project Zero Prize, participants are asked to report the bugs in the Android issue tracker. They can then be used as a part of submission by the participant any time during the six month contest period. Only the first person to file a bug can use it as a part of their submission, so file early and file often!” She added that Google’s main motivation is to gain information about how these bugs and exploits work, and of course to fix them so they don’t impact users.  “There are often rumours of remote Android exploits, but it’s fairly rare to see one in action,” she said. “We’re hoping this contest will improve the public body of knowledge on these types of exploits. Hopefully this will teach us what components these issues can exist in, how security mitigations are bypassed and other information that could help protect against these types of bugs.” Google has embraced the bug bounty concept wholeheartedly. To mark the first anniversary of Google’s Android Security Rewards program over the summer, the company announced an increase in how much it will pay for vulnerability reports. For what Google calls a “high-quality vulnerability report with proof of concept,” security researchers saw payments increase 33% from $3000 (£2100, €2700) to $4000 (£2800, €3500). A high-quality vulnerability report with a proof of concept, a CTS Test, or a patch will get 50% more.

When it comes to map apps, consumers are finding plenty of fresh paths to digital navigation thanks to Google, Apple and many rivals. Here WeGo, Waze, MapFactor, Mapquest, Scout GPS, Maps.Me and InRoute are just some of the apps that are challenging Google Maps and Apple Maps, which dominate smartphone mapping services, by focusing on new and novel features. Google and Apple, though, aren’t content to stay in the slow lane of innovation. Both have added new features to their map apps in recent months, including enabling users to add interim destinations to go along with the ultimate stop on a trip. Google’s changes rolled out in an update to Google Maps this summer; Apple’s changes will be included in iOS 10, the soon-to-be released next version of its mobile operating system. “Just open the app, enter a destination, tap the corner menu, and then click add a stop,” Google says in a blog post. “To rearrange the order of your stops, tap and hold the three-dot menu to the left of Add Stop and drag it to the position you want.” The Apple Maps service has new features that seek to meld activities and services associated with a trip. “Apps like OpenTable can integrate bookings right into Maps,” Apple says on its website. “Services like Uber and Lyft can make it easier for users to book a ride, without ever leaving the Maps app.” And while this navigational arms race shifts into high gear, it’s become apparent the original stand-alone GPS devices are becoming stranded by the side of the road. The proliferation of smartphone apps has reshaped a market once dominated by the stand-alone machines, such as TomTom, Garmin and Magellan. According to market research firm Berg Insight, worldwide shipments of personal navigation devices has decreased from 40 million units in 2008 to a projected 11 million by the end of this year. That number is expected to drop to just 7 million in 2019 – less than a tenth of projected smartphone map app users in that year. “Most consumers are using their smartphones as their primary navigation and map system,” said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, a market researcher. “Retailers, in a lot of cases, don’t really promote the stand-alone devices any more.” The established map apps from Google and Apple offer a wide array of features, with the centerpiece being turn-by-turn navigation. And while the emerging apps also typically offer turn-based directions, they all attempt to offer niche features that also can go beyond the basics of the apps from the tech titans. Google-owned Waze, whose service is separate from Google Maps, emphasizes the social aspects of traveling, and its new features include improved ways to share your estimated time of arrival with others. It also provides quick access to frequent destinations. “You can use Waze to find out about lots of things,” Bajarin said. “It pops up icons to tell you about traffic, police in your area, gives you suggestions on alternate routes. It’s the integration of social media with navigation.” Other apps also seek to meld the drive with other services. Scout GPS emphasizes social interaction, including the ability to message friends and family and share your location or destination with designated people. Here WeGo allows you to summon taxicabs or access a ride-hailing service. And some apps focus on improving the driving experience. Mapquest, one of the first computer-based navigation guides, recently began allowing drivers to see speed limits on the street they’re traveling. Maps.Me has added navigation elements that take up less space on the screen, and the speed the vehicle is traveling has been added. InRoute, designed mainly for long road trips, offers the ability to add numerous stops – and drivers can easily select routes that avoid areas with hot temperatures or hilly terrain. Saying it makes “cities easier to use,” Citymapper is geared to the daily commuter. In addition to vehicle navigation, the app has found a way to coordinate public transit and ride-hailing services so people can plan integrated trips. Citymapper’s service can be especially handy in big cities with major transit networks, said Michael Tchong, founder of Las Vegas-based Ubercool Innovation, which tracks technology trends. “The wave of the future is Citymapper,” Tchong said. “It integrates vehicle navigation, buses, subways, trains, Uber, Lyft all in one package. It will tell you whether the train you are on is running on time.” Experts predict the pace of innovation will pick up even more for map apps. “The map apps could become automated and start working as soon as you turn on your phone,” said Rob Enderle, an Oregon-based analyst who tracks the tech sector. “That way, if you’re driving, you don’t have to juggle a bunch of apps.” And map apps also may become more closely attuned to their users. They might start taking note of what types of restaurants you visit and only suggest those when you’re looking for a place to eat, Bajarin said. “The unique personalization of mapping is the next step,” he said. “We are on that cusp.” The big two The two big map apps for the major phone platforms are the widely used Google Maps for Android and iPhone and Apple Maps for the iPhone. GOOGLE MAPS What’s new: The ability to add interim stops to a destination, as well as estimates for how much time the detour will add to the trip. APPLE MAPS What’s new: Apple upgrades, include an interim stops feature; users who want a reminder of where they parked their car can use a pin drop as a target. The challengers Here are some free map apps that attempt to challenge, or at least seek to address some shortcomings of, the two primary programs from Google and Apple. WAZE What’s new: A cleaner and fresh look, with quick access to frequent destinations; a new way to share your ETA with others. MAPQUEST What’s new: Users can get speed limits to appear on their screens, including if you’re in a school zone. The route ahead is shown in what is called “2.5D” which Mapquest calls the “Perspective View.” Distance to a location now automatically updates. Here WEGO What’s new: Now easier to pick a destination and scroll to the mode of transportation. The app also offers ride-booking company Car2Go, as well as info on taxi services. MAPFACTOR What’s new: Better alternative route calculation; improved Google searches; the icon highlights when searching for a point of interest. SCOUT GPS What’s new: Although turn-by-turn navigation is available, the app focuses on social interactions. Among the new features: You can send messages to friends and family; drive to the location of friends and family; share your location, route and real-time ETA; and ask a friend to pick you up. MAPS.ME What’s new: The navigation elements take up less space; speed is now displayed; and an autozoom element has been added; bicycle riders can see terrain data; search results show hotel ratings and prices. INROUTE What’s new: Custom routes that let people avoid the heat on a summer road trip, or for those towing a trailer, ways to avoid steep hills; users can also chose routes with a lot of curves. CITYMAPPER What’s new: Travelers can get alerts about disruptions on transit systems in a city.

Gmail outage hits US, Europe 0 Share: Tech Culture by Alfred Ng September 14, 2016 9:53 AM PDT @alfredwkng Up Next Is MacBook Pro perfect? No, but it's worth $3,000 to me Enlarge Image The outage smacked people on both sides of the Atlantic. Photo by Screenshot by CNET of Down Detector Gmail went down Wednesday across the world for millions, with people in the US and UK apparently hit the hardest. The disconnection immediately became a disruption for work flow and Gchat conversations in the thick of the US workday. The search engine giant confirmed that its extensive email network experienced a service disruption starting at 8:16 a.m. PT. "We're investigating reports of an issue with Gmail. We will provide more information shortly," Google wrote on its Apps Status dashboard. "Based on reports, it affects only Google for Work Gmail users." Google did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. As a suggested workaround, the company recommended disabling Gmail Service in your Admin Console UI, saving the changes, turning it back on and saving the changes again. By 9 a.m. PT, service for a few Gmail for Work users had returned, but remained down on Google's App Status Dashboard. The company said it had identified the cause of the problem and was working on a potential fix. "Gmail service has already been restored for some users, and we expect a resolution for all users in the near future," Google wrote in an update at 9:40 a.m. PT. First published September 14 at 8:37 a.m. PT. Update 9:04 a.m. and 9:53 a.m. PT: Added that Gmail's services had returned for some users, with comments from Google.

And what’s next for it does not seem to be particularly enticing either, at least judging from the reactions of major OEMs like LG, Motorola and Huawei… According to various spokespersons in contact with CNET, in fact, none of them seem particularly interested in picking up the slack and doubling down on their previous efforts, mainly blaming the generally scarce maturity of the market as a reason for not putting the effort into Google’s platform for wearables. Whereas Apple just announced its Series 2 Apple Watch and Samsung is ready to ship its own Tizen-powered Gear S3 timepiece, only a few OEMs are coming up with Android Wear options, such as Asus and its ZenWatch 3 and Nixon’s sport-oriented Mission. There seems, basically, no “flagship” smartwatch on the horizon, one to truly go up against the competition and flex Wear 2.0’s muscle. As for LG — which released its Urbane Watch 2nd Edition LTE earlier this year — it looks like they are not committed to a follow up, and would rather “see what sticks”, as per the firm’s Ken Hong. But worse is Motorola and Huawei’s situation, with both over a year from replenishing stores’ shelves with a new watch. “One of the things we see in the future is connected [cellular] watches, and our opinion is that while it’s technically feasible, the trade-offs on the product itself means we’re not quite ready yet,” a spokeswoman for Motorola told CNET. Huawei, on the other hand, is hiding behind a shady wait for “components to shrink and for the processor to gain efficiency” before launching a successor to their watch. However, for Android Wear enthusiasts, not all hope seems to be lost. Google’s recent efforts in the hardware space under the newly formed division led by ex-Motorola COO Rick Osterloh are about to fall into place come the company’s October 4 event, where among a slew of other devices we could see the two rumored Google-made watches. While not specifically mentioned in the rumors surrounding the event, the so-codenamed Angelfish and Swordfish are indeed real products, and it looks like Google is still looking forward to launching them by the end of the year — likely to both balance the lack of third part offering and indeed reinforce its status as a legit new player in the hardware space, not just smartphone-wise. We will cover the event extensively, so be sure to mark your calendar and tune in when the time comes. But in the meantime, tell us what you think: do you like the Android Wear platform, and are you excited to see Google‘s own take on it? Fire up your keyboard in the comment section below.

We’ve seen that in Google’s monthly Android security updates, which have been relatively successful so far with some OEMs keeping devices somewhat up to date. Now the company is introducing another method to find Android vulnerabilities, a hacking contest by Project Zero… For those out of the loop, Project Zero is Google’s own internal team of security researchers who find and document vulnerabilities and bugs in widely-available software (i.e. Android, Chrome OS, etc). Now Project Zero has announced a hacking contest for anyone that might be up to the challenge. What needs to be done? Participants will be tasked with attempting to find “a vulnerability or bug chain that achieves remote code execution on multiple Android devices knowing only the devices’ phone number and email address.” The average-joe translation of that is that participants will need to find a way to cause serious trouble on an Android device through a text message, phone call, or email. This isn’t limited to apps such as the dialer, though. If a remote hack is found that can be executed by knowing just a phone number or email address, it can be submitted for a chance to win one of three prizes. To enter, participants will need to send in research via an Android issue tracker report and then send it over to Project Zero. First prize of $200,000 will be awarded to one person. Second prize will also only go to one winner, but with $100,000 in tow. Third prize will be handed out to multiple winners from a pool of at least $50,000. Winners will also be asked to write a brief technical report of the entry for the Project Zero blog. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

Copyright law already provides reporters with protection for the news stories they publish, but in a draft directive published Wednesday the European Commission wants to create an additional, related right giving newspapers more powers to make news aggregators pay for using snippets consisting of, say, the headline and a sentence or two of each story. News publishers say that in reusing such snippets without payment, aggregators like Google News are stealing their content. Meanwhile, the aggregators maintain that they are sending news websites additional traffic they can monetize. Two EU countries have already tried what the Commission is proposing, and it didn't turn out well. In Germany publishers decided not to charge Google for using their snippets rather than lose the traffic Google News brings them. And in Spain, where a 2014 law gave publishers no option but to charge for republication of their snippets, Google simply closed down the local edition of Google News. It couldn't afford to pay for the snippets because it makes no money from the service, which carries no advertising, it said. The Commission's latest proposal will hurt not just Google but also European startups trying to build a business on news aggregation, Google's vice president for global policy, Caroline Atkinson, wrote on the company's European public policy blog. "Paying to display snippets is not a viable option for anyone," she wrote, implying that the company will respond across Europe as it did in Spain and Germany. It's not just Google that dislikes the proposal. The Mozilla Foundation's Chief Business and Legal Officer, Denelle Dixon-Thayer, called it "failed and harmful" in an email. John Higgins, director general of industry group Digital Europe, warned: "This proposal appears to be sacrificing the next generation of young, innovative European creators in order to protect the interests of legacy media and their rigid business models." And Joe McNamee, executive director of European Digital Rights (EDRi), a lobby group usually found on the opposite side of the online privacy debate to Google, described the proposal as poison for Europeans' free speech, for European business and for creativity. "It could not conceivably be worse," he said. There was one piece of good news for those who feared the Commission would also introduce a so-called hyperlink tax: The additional protection envisaged for news sites "does not extend to acts of hyperlinking which do not constitute communication to the public," the draft directive noted.

Viewership, of course, was a mystery, but the launch seemed to make some noise. Yet the show's creator - hardly a no-name player - began to fret. There had been no congratulatory call nor even an email from anyone at Netflix. That's a far cry from the way relationships long have been managed in Hollywood, but sources who do business with the streaming service say the silence was not atypical. "Really celebrating or valuing some of their successes - they just don't do that," says one agent. Still, at a time when business is tough all over in the entertainment industry, there is a lot of gratitude for a deep-pocketed buyer that is snapping up an array of material, much of which might not find a home elsewhere. Netflix and its chief content officer Ted Sarandos are at once a savior, offering a giant gush of money to license shows that in some cases were past their prime or even out of production, and a terrifying competitor to studios. "Out of the blue Netflix comes into the market and says, 'We're going to give you a number [to license a network show],' " says one television agent. "For the studios, it was, 'Holy shit. Do we even need a cable sale?' They all got addicted to crack. Nobody really thought they'd be a competitor on the originals market. They used stuff from the studios and became important. Now you see the backlash." The backlash is real but muted - mostly because few are willing to risk the wrath of a company that is spending $6 billion a year on programming and scored 54 Emmy nominations this year. But some executives, producers and agents who rely on deals with the streaming giant nonetheless increasingly view Netflix as an existential threat. Studios and cable channels fret that the company, with its 83 million global subscribers, is sucking up so many eyeballs and bidding up prices for programming so high that they won't be able to compete. And agents worry that as Netflix elbows out competing buyers, the company's growing insistence on buying up all rights to its original programming around the world will do away with the profit participations that on breakout shows (such as Modern Family) provide steady income in an unsteady industry. "We love the money and we can still grow our clients [by getting them Netflix deals]," says one agent. "But I'm worried about the long term. If backends go away, what's the future? This is why CAA and WME have diversified." View photos Hastings and Orange Is the New Black creator Jenji Kohan at the 2014 AFI Awards Luncheon in Beverly Hills. Netflix generally declined to comment on THR's questions but asserts that it and other streaming services have sparked the creation of "huge numbers of programs," as one company insider puts it, generating more opportunity and money for the industry. That's one point of view. Another was offered by John Landgraf at the July gathering of the Television Critics Association in Beverly Hills, where the FX Networks chief warned that Netflix could be bucking for a Silicon Valley-style near-monopoly in entertainment, such as that enjoyed by Google in search or Amazon in shopping. "I think it would be bad for storytellers in general if one company was able to seize a 40, 50, 60 percent share in storytelling," said Landgraf. The clear implication: If Netflix amasses such clout, the generous deals will start to evaporate and creative freedoms could be curtailed. Some assert that the latter already has happened. Sources say, for example, that Beau Willimon, who adapted the British series House of Cards to give Netflix its first breakout original, was taken off the show after its fourth season because he pushed back hard on notes from Netflix execs. Willimon declined comment. House of Cards producer Dana Brunetti also refused to comment on the Willimon exit, but the outspoken executive does say Netflix no longer offers the artistic freedom that lured the creators of the drama there. "There's nothing special about Netflix anymore," says Brunetti (who has stated publicly that he has shorted Netflix stock). "They had the first-mover advantage with digital streaming and giving artists more power, but now they've become like any traditional network or studio. And there are a lot of competitors." (Worth noting: Brunetti now is an executive at Relativity Media, which has been in a legal dispute with Netflix over the streamer's so-far-unsuccessful efforts to escape a rich deal for Relativity films after the latter filed for bankruptcy in July 2015 - before Brunetti was hired. Relativity emerged from Chapter 11 protection in March.) Still, few can ignore the billions that Netflix has thrown around. Even though Landgraf said he'd prefer not to hand any content to Netflix, his company in July made a deal giving the streaming service exclusive rights to its American Crime Story series, pocketing what is said to be about $50 million just for the lauded first installment, The People v. O.J. Simpson. View photos Holland, Netflix vp original content, was flanked by actors Boyd Holbrook (left) and Wagner Moura at the season two premiere of Narcos on Aug. 24. There's plenty more where that came from. "Anybody who's going to spend $6 billion or $7 billion a year on library and original content deserves to be applauded," says ICM Partners' Chris Silbermann. "Do you know how bad this business would be if their $6 billion went away tomorrow?" (For reference, HBO will spend a bit more than $2 billion this year.) Netflix provides the cash up front and orders two seasons of most series - appealing in a business in which many shows are canceled in the first season. While it remains an open question whether Netflix will become the Google of Hollywood, there's ample evidence that it already presents a tough corporate tech culture that doesn't cater to sensitive showrunners and others who are used to being handled with more care. In many cases, Netflix is a black box for show creators and producers who have business at the company. Several say they have no idea how their show will be marketed, if at all. They get no feedback on how their show is received. There are no metrics, so rewards for success aren't built into a deal (though compensation may be increased if a series' budget goes up). Few in Hollywood have the courage to speak publicly about Netflix, and those who have projects there say they are subjected to unusually onerous restrictions on what they are permitted to say, if anything. Retired NFL player Trevor Pryce, who sold the animated series Kulipari: An Army of Frogs to Netflix, jokingly references Fight Club - "The first rule of Netflix: You do not talk about Netflix" - in an interview that soon will air on my KCRW show, The Business. In its sole response to THR, a Netflix spokesperson offered this: "We are doing something that's never been done before; bringing great stories to people all over the world at the same time and at unprecedented quality and scale. In doing so, we are disrupting traditional business models and creating new norms. Not everyone likes disruption, but we've hired executives with extensive Hollywood and international media experience who are thriving at Netflix, and we are working successfully with a wide variety of creators and studios who understand and appreciate our approach. Most importantly, consumers and viewers like what we do, and we plan to keep doing it." &bull&bull&bull How times have changed in the six years since Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes dismissed upstart Netflix as "the Albanian army." Netflix's revenue since it launched its streaming service in 2007 grew from $1.2 billion to $6.8 billion in 2015. It has 47 million subscribers in the U.S. and 36 million abroad (by comparison, ESPN has roughly 90 million subscribers). It is in 190 countries, with shows in 20 languages. Netflix expects to release more than 30 original series, or 600 hours of original scripted programming, this year - stunning when one remembers that the service's brilliant opening gambit, House of Cards, only premiered in February 2013. Says HBO chairman and CEO Richard Plepler: "I have nothing but respect for Netflix. Anybody who does not tip their hat to what they've done in the last six or seven years is not being fair." Next year, Netflix, with 2,800 employees, will move the 600 now packed into offices on Maple Drive in Beverly Hills into more than 200,000 square feet in the 14-story Icon building under construction in Hollywood at Sunset Bronson Studios. The company is expanding at its Silicon Valley headquarters, too. The only thing growing faster than Netflix's footprint is the hope among many in the town's establishment that some combination of factors will slow the juggernaut. Maybe the studios will hold back programming. Maybe well-funded competitors - especially Amazon - will find a way to block Netflix. Maybe key talent will become wary of doing business there. Maybe Netflix will spend itself to death as it rebaits the hook to keep subscribers and lure in more. The stock market noticed when the company revealed in July that growth in the second quarter was not as robust as anticipated. The company added 160,000 U.S. subscribers and 1.52 million in overseas markets, far fewer than the 500,000 it had projected in the U.S. and 2 million abroad. The company said price increases were to blame for cancellations that drove down its numbers, but price hikes had yet to go into effect for more than half of its U.S. customers, whose rates changed in the second half of 2016. On an analysts call, CEO and co-founder Reed Hastings apologized for the volatility and declared, "The big picture is very much intact." Certainly Netflix is far cheaper than cable, and subscribers can access a cornucopia of content, from an intense drama like Narcos to a comedy as weird as Maria Bamford's Lady Dynamite. There are documentaries, children's programs, Adam Sandler movies and Beasts of No Nation. "They're like a giant shopping mall," says one agent. "They're trying to fill those spaces with something for everyone. They literally are trying to fill every space." Despite the company's ability to know exactly what is being watched and for how long, the service isn't immune to the unpredictability that's made Hollywood a pretty crazy place for a century or so. Sarandos acknowledged during a recent THR roundtable that Stranger Things, which was spurned elsewhere but became a summer hit, was a "big surprise." A less happy surprise, it seems, was Baz Luhrmann's musical drama The Get Down, said to have cost in excess of $120 million for 12 episodes. Despite generally positive reviews, the first six episodes landed in August almost silently. Production troubles are said to have strained Netflix's relationship with its partner on the project, Sony Pictures Television (which shouldered some of the cost overruns). Subsequently, Netflix cut the third season of Bloodline - another series on which it partners with Sony - from 13 episodes to 10. It also notified Sony that the show's third season would be its last, though it had been anticipated that the series would have a fourth season. Netflix also slashed licensing fees on the show. Both Netflix and Sony deny there are tensions between them, and Sony television still has a lot of business with Netflix. If Netflix was daunted by the big spend on The Get Down, it is keeping its game face on. At the THR roundtable, Sarandos hinted that an upcoming series about the royal family, The Crown, might be even more expensive. And in a recent interview with The Economist, Hastings further rattled his already nervous competitors by suggesting that his company might be willing to spend a lot more. If shows like The Get Down or HBO's Game of Thrones cost $10 million per episode, Hastings mused, "what does $20 million-an-hour television look like?" View photos Netflix chief content officer Sarandos and actress Winona Ryder after the Los Angeles premiere of Stranger Things on July 11. Netflix also is unafraid to spend big on movies. It is said to be paying Brad Pitt $20 million to star in the satire War Machine. And it recently committed $90 million to make Bright, with David Ayer directing and Will Smith starring. Netflix knocked two or three studios out of the bidding for the film, which sources say would likely be tagged with an R rating if it were released theatrically. As that not only would have narrowed the film's prospective audience in the U.S. but also would preclude a run in China, no other studio wanted to spend more than $60 million on the project. Sources say nearly half of Netflix's $90 million will go to buy out profit participations. And Ayer will reap about $10 million for directing, a big step up from the roughly $5 million he got to handle the writing and directing on Suicide Squad. Netflix also is making smaller movies that otherwise might be homeless. "As sellers, we're glad they're on the block," says producer Michael De Luca, who recently set up a film based on Sarah Pinborough's YA novel 13 Minutes at Netflix. On such projects, says another film producer, Netflix buys out the backend and offers about 20 percent over production costs - "equivalent to what [profit participants] would have gotten from a studio on a modest hit." With Netflix offering no metrics, it's impossible to know whether the upfront compensation is a windfall or falls short of what a film would have earned through a conventional theatrical release. The upside is that money is assured and there is no risk of reading horrifying box-office numbers on a Saturday morning. But for some filmmakers, a theatrical run still has meaning, and a deal with Netflix means giving that up. Unlike Amazon, Netflix has refused to open up an exclusive window for exhibitors - one reason why Nate Parker chose to sell The Birth of a Nation to Fox Searchlight in a Sundance auction even though Netflix offered millions more. &bull&bull&bull Netflix's huge appetite isn't limited to content. Some in Hollywood believe the company keeps a tally of how many promising young execs it poaches from competitors around town." They're trying to staff up and they're overpaying executives to go there and they're working them to death," says one agent. The company's infamous "statement of culture," posted online, declares, "Adequate performance gets a generous severance package." It also says the company isn't right for those who "feel fearful at Netflix" or who'd be "bitter if let go." Yet turnover, at least among creative execs, appears to be low. With exceptions at the uppermost levels, sources say many Netflix execs don't have assistants. They run their own phone sheets, which may explain why many calls go unreturned. That doesn't sit well with those who sit at the top of the Hollywood pyramid. "I can get Les Moonves, Steve Burke or Bob Iger to call me back," exclaims one senior agent. "I can't get [Netflix vp content] Cindy Holland to call me back. It's unbelievable!" The big question that fascinates those who do business with Netflix in Hollywood is how long the company can keep spending at such an astounding rate. "The first stage was obviously to get into the world and own the streaming space, which they did," says an agent. "The question is, is that sustainable with well-capitalized competitors like Amazon and Hulu and potentially Apple?" (Or, one might ask, does all the competition make it more imperative to keep spending?) Guillaume de Chalendar, Bank Leumi's global head of media and entertainment, wonders whether the day won't come, in just a few years, when Netflix needs an alliance. "Because they do not have the benefit of having a strategic shareholder - like HBO, Sky or Canal Satellite did when they embarked on a similarly aggressive investment program in the late 1990s - Netflix is in a situation where their spending on programming could become challenging, unless they maintain the steady growth in subscription levels we have seen to date," he says. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, a longtime Netflix critic, thinks the company's spending will drive it to keep raising prices, which will take a toll. "At $15 a month," says Pachter, "Netflix is not as appealing as at $10 a month." And he dismisses the notion that its data on consumer habits ensures that it makes better choices than competitors. "HBO is a disciplined content creator," he says (though it, too, has had major stumbles, including Vinyl). "Netflix made Marco Polo. Are you kidding me?" For every bear, there is a bull. BTIG's Rich Greenfield sees cord-cutting as the future and long has been a Netflix proponent. Still, with Netflix having missed its projections for subscriber growth and with increasingly aggressive competitors in the game, he sounds a note of caution. A key question, he says, is how well Netflix can do in tough overseas markets. "Can they be successful in Europe and Asia?" he says. "To be determined." But a leading agent thinks Netflix will stay in the game, though perhaps not as the dominant player that it is today. Right now, he says, "Netflix is like David Geffen's yacht. It's amazing! HBO has a seaworthy boat. John Landgraf also has a beautiful boat. I think they all get over the wave. We're going to have five strong players, and it won't necessarily be the players that we're used to. But Netflix will assuredly be among those companies."

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 16, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Why I still hate LinkedIn Ads PPC Social 14 Sep 16 | Larry Kim Facebook0 Linkedin231 Google+12 Twitter 243 Like a lot of marketers, I find LinkedIn Ads frustrating. The thing is, by making just a few needed improvements, both LinkedIn itself and advertisers could greatly benefit. For LinkedIn, advertising could be bringing in much more than a meagre $181 million in revenues, as it did during the second quarter of 2016. Compare that to the advertising revenues of Google ($19 billion) and Facebook ($6 billion) during the same quarter. For advertisers, better LinkedIn ads would offer some pretty obvious benefits. It would give brands and businesses another platform to reach LinkedIn’s 450 million professionals (although only a quarter of those users are reportedly active every month). Win, win. Right? That’s what led me to write LinkedIn Ads Review: 8 Things I Hate About LinkedIn Ads about 18 months ago. Then, in May 2015, the nice people at LinkedIn invited me to their headquarters to talk ads. I spoke with their brilliant product managers about some great things that they were thinking about. So here we are, 18 months later, and my core question remains the same: if advertising isn’t a priority for LinkedIn, why should advertisers care about LinkedIn? Have things improved in the last year and a half? Has LinkedIn, which was acquired by Microsoft for $26.2 billion, gotten its advertising act together? Spoiler alert: not yet. LinkedIn has made some much-needed progress, but has a ton of deficiencies and remains a mediocre ad network. Let’s count down the seven things I still hate about LinkedIn ads. 7. No Video! Why can’t we upload videos to LinkedIn? It’s kind of insane. Video advertising is one of the most effective ways to bias people. Numerous studies have shown that video improves brand recall and affinity, helps with lead generation, and increases engagement (e.g., shares, CTR). 6. Still No Remarketing! Remarketing has been around for more than six years. But my concern about LinkedIn Ads remains unchanged since last time: You can buy remarketing ads on Twitter, Facebook, on the Google Display Network, at YouTube, and even for Google Search – but you can’t get it on LinkedIn. Remarketing is still not there. After LinkedIn announced the retirement of Lead Accelerator, there was some talk that remarketing ads were coming “soon”. We heard that LinkedIn would roll some elements of Lead Accelerator into the self-service platform. Well, we’re still waiting. You don’t get points for “soon.” 5. Still No Custom Lists! LinkedIn still doesn’t have anything comparable to Facebook’s Custom Audiences or Twitter’s Tailored Audiences. Seriously? Meanwhile, the power of custom audiences on other platforms is actually getting stronger. Google now has Customer Match. And on Facebook you can overlay custom audiences with specific attributes, interests and demographics. 4. Still No Lead Gen Ad Formats! I can’t even begin to understand how a network for business professionals doesn’t offer advertisers a way to capture leads. You’ll have much more success doing lead generation on Twitter or using Lead Generation Ads on Facebook. Yet here we are. Still nothing to see here from LinkedIn Ads.

Pricing Is Still Bad! Last time I took LinkedIn to task for failing to try to deliver the best value to advertisers. Well, it’s gotten worse since then for advertisers. Prices have gone up substantially. Look at these CPC prices – $8 bids?! Yes, on LinkedIn Ads you’re stuck with relatively static pricing. 2. Ad Quality Still Doesn’t Matter! A true Quality Score system is missing from LinkedIn Ads. There’s no reward for running unicorn ad campaigns on LinkedIn, even though Google, Facebook, and Twitter all dramatically reward advertisers for making the effort to create high-quality ads. Facebook and AdWords show advertisers the relevancy scores in their accounts to enable them to make optimizations. On the flip side, the absence of a Quality Score on LinkedIn means there’s no penalty for having the worst, most boring donkey ad possible. Some other platforms won’t show an ad if the engagement is too low. On LinkedIn, you can run terrible ads forever – even if it takes 20,000 impressions to generate a single click. It also means my LinkedIn strategy is much different. I create lower funnel, high friction ads. For example: This is kind of like asking to get married on the first date! But if you’re going to pay $8 per click, you might as well ask people to take the action you really want them to take! It’s a big ask. I would never do this on other display/social ad platforms. Rather, I’d do content promotion with the goal of remarketing to people who engage. But, again, there’s still no remarketing on LinkedIn. 1. Account promotion still doesn’t exist! Organic visibility on LinkedIn is remarkably good compared to Facebook. Unfortunately there’s no “Follower” ad campaign type. Last time I compared the lack of account promotion as trying to do social media with both arms tied behind your back. “If you use [LinkedIn] ads to promote your Company Page, you have to just cross your fingers and hope that once they click through to your Page, they choose to follow it.” If you want an ad format that will increase the number of people following your company page on LinkedIn, look elsewhere. You still won’t find this on LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads: any improvements? OK, we’ve beaten up LinkedIn pretty good, but it’s only because we love them and want them to improve their advertising product. LinkedIn has made two significant improvements: LinkedIn has given us a much-needed revamp of its campaign editing interface. They did a great job and this actually has what you’d expect a 2016 platform to offer. LinkedIn Ads now offers conversion tracking. The lack of conversion tracking was so annoying. While this addition is indeed great news, the bad news is that basically all you can see is how bad your ad performance is. I do this because I love LinkedIn. I really do! I’m just underwhelmed by their self-service ads. Advertising accounts for just 20% of LinkedIn’s revenues – that means they’re missing out on a huge opportunity. Hopefully, LinkedIn will soon recognize its full advertising potential and learn from Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and give us advertisers a fantastic self-service ads platform.

(Photo: AFP/Lionel Bonaventure) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A STRASBOURG: The EU will overhaul copyright law to shake up how online news and entertainment is paid for in Europe, under proposals announced by European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday (Sep 14). Pop stars such as Coldplay and Lady Gaga will hail part of the plan as a new weapon to bring a fair fight to YouTube, the Google-owned video service that they say is sapping the music business. But the reform plans have attracted the fury of filmmakers and start-up investors who see it as a threat to European innovation and a wrong-headed favour to powerful media groups. "I want journalists, publishers and authors to be paid fairly for their work, whether it is made in studios or living rooms," Juncker said as he gave his annual State of the Union speech. "Whether it is disseminated offline or online, whether it is published via a copying machine or commercially hyperlinked on the web." The overhaul is meant to bring European copyright law up to date with the digital age to make the world's largest trading bloc more competitive in a tough global field. One major change would force internet portals such as Google or Reddit to pay newspaper publishers a licence fee when using small extracts or snippets of news content - most notably on Google News or Huffington Post. "The commission's plan to create a copyright for news publishers in Europe is a significant and historic step," said Carlo Perrone, head of the European Newspaper Publishers' Association. But opponents say this idea punishes smaller publishers and is highly ineffective, as proven when both Germany and Spain created similar systems with neither case producing the badly needed life support to starved newspapers. "How we share and use the news is in danger. (This plan) won't lead to more income for news sites, let alone journalists," said MEP Daniel Dalton, a conservative from Britain. 'BACKWARD STEP' Google, whose news service is the principal target of the reform, said the proposal was a "backward step for copyright in Europe". "It would hurt anyone who writes, reads or shares the news," said Caroline Atkinson, Google's vice president for Global Policy. Another divisive proposal is a push to make national broadcasters, such as Sky in the UK or RTL in Germany, provide online content - including films or sports - Europe-wide, instead of just at home. In another highly criticised change, the commission is asking that video platforms, such as YouTube or even Facebook, use technology that can track violations of copyright and shut them down. Cracking down on YouTube is a key demand of some of the world's biggest music artists who said in a letter to Juncker last June that YouTube was stealing value from streaming services, such as Spotify. Google said it was already working with copyright tracking software, but warned against rules that would force platforms, including Facebook, to mass filter all content. "This would effectively turn the internet into a place where everything uploaded to the web must be cleared by lawyers before it can find an audience," Google's Atkinson said. The raft of proposals is sure to trigger a furious fight with lobbyists. It must go to the European Parliament and EU states for approval, which could take months or years.Strasbourg (France) - The EU will overhaul copyright law to shake up how online news and entertainment is paid for in Europe, under proposals announced by European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker Wednesday.

But the copyright rules have already proven controversial, and are likely to face pushback from both U.S.-based companies like Google and Facebook, and European consumer advocates. The proposed EU framework focuses on the rights of publishers and people who make videos and music, and could end up requiring platforms like Google, Twitter and Facebook to get permissions or pay fees for linking to copyrighted content. “It might be a double-edged sword,” said Eleonora Rosati, a professor of intellectual property law at the University of Southampton in the U.K. “At the end of the day these news aggregators might drive traffic to newspapers’ websites.” She said in Spain, where a similar law already exists that doesn’t allow publishers to waive the fee, Google news disappeared. But Chris Green, a tech analyst with the firm LEWIS, said it’s not Google and Facebook that will have the hardest time complying with rules imposing fees and allowing publishers and video and media producers to go after platforms that display their content. “The biggest concerns are actually gonna sit more with smaller technology companies, the ones who don’t have an internal, fully fledged legal department,” Green said. The proposal does include exceptions to the stringent copyright rules for material that’s educational or culturally important. The “areas of intervention” where the EU will attempt to allow more free movement of information will be “digital and cross-border uses in the field of education, text and data mining in the field of scientific research, and preservation of cultural heritage.” “We don’t have a clause like fair use,” said Julia Reda, a German member of parliament who worked closely on the European Parliament’s draft of copyright rules, referring to the broad set of exceptions in the U.S. for recycling copyrighted content for another purpose. She said much of what parliament proposed was ignored as the European Commission attempted to accommodate “old media,” and she’s concerned that a focus on fees and enforcement will only backfire, preventing consumers from accessing information freely and rendering wealthy companies like Google the only viable distribution platforms. Google subsidiary YouTube has already built its own technology to monitor copyright on its site in an attempt to prevent fees and lawsuits. In a speech Wednesday, EU President Jean-Claude Juncker said the rules are about modernizing and increasing access — while also protecting content creators. “As the world goes digital, we also have to empower our artists and creators and protect their works,” he said. Google, probably in effect the largest potential target of the laws, posted its own response to the proposal Wednesday, praising aspects of it while also expressing concerns: Today’s proposal suggests that works including text, video, images and more must be filtered by online services. This would effectively turn the internet into a place where everything uploaded to the web must be cleared by lawyers before it can find an audience. Google, which has already been lobbying in Brussels around the issue, said it will continue to play a part in the discussions. Now that a detailed proposal has been released, it could take up to a year for the EU to pass it into law.

This year alone, the government has banned Facebook's free web service and declined to exempt Apple from local sourcing rules and open its own stores. Now, the government could force companies to use technology cooked up in a government-funded lab. The initiative is part of Aadhaar, the national biometric identity programme. Millions of people use fingerprint and iris-scan authentication to access a range of public and private services which includes banking, too. Failure to join the effort could limit the tech industry's access to a vast and growing market, but companies like Apple and Google are expected to resist opening up their phones and operating systems to the country's registration, encryption and security technology. "There will be a lot of pushing and shoving by the technology companies," says Neeraj Aggarwal, managing director, Boston Consulting Group, India. "It will be a battle of ecosystems, and companies would do their best to hold on to their own." A few weeks ago, government officials invited executives from Apple, Microsoft, Samsung Electronics and Google to discuss embedding Aadhaar encryption into their technology. None of the companies would comment on what transpired. Apple didn't show up at all. Ajay Bhushan Pandey, chief executive officer, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), who had convened the meeting, says the industry representatives listened politely and were non-committal. But, Pandey said he was frank about the government's position, telling his visitors: "Go to your headquarters and work this out so that we can have Aadhaar-registered devices." The biometric identity program is something of a path breaker. While the Federal Bureau of Investigation and US VISIT visa program use similar technology to respectively track criminals and foreign visitors, no other country has taken the concept as far as India. Designed in part to help thwart criminals who siphon off billions of dollars in welfare payments each year, Aadhaar helps authenticate millions of poor citizens so the government can send money in lieu of food, fuel and fertilizer subsidies, as well as pension and guaranteed work payments directly to their bank accounts electronically. Civil liberties and citizens' groups say the program violates Indians' privacy; others warn that Aadhaar's servers could be hacked and compromise national security. But the government is moving ahead and in recent weeks has rolled out a digital payments infrastructure built on top of the program. The idea is to bring financial services to a nation where millions have never set foot inside a bank, let alone opened an account. As the country's billion-user Aadhaar jigsaw fits into place, the government plans to ramp up and add a host of other services including education and health care. "We are doing five million authentications daily, and with Aadhaar-compliant devices that number will grow exponentially," Pandey says. "There is a solid business case for technology companies to enable Aadhaar services." Indians would still log into their smartphones using the manufacturer's biometric authentication - typically a fingerprint or iris scan. But once they access Aadhaar using the government's encryption, the likes of Apple and Google would lose the ability to track users online, forfeiting the ability to mine that data to sell ads or other products and services. (Indian law, by the way, bars the government from collecting or using customer data.) Tech companies will probably also object to allowing the government to install its authentication software on their gadgets for fear of security breaches and hacking attacks. Apple has strenuously resisted the U.S. government's demands to build a back door into its operating system so law enforcement can track the movements of terrorists and criminals. "There should be clarity and provisions about security," says Amresh Nandan, a research director at Gartner Inc. On the other hand, foreign tech companies could be at a competitive disadvantage if they don't go along because Indian companies like Flipkart, Paytm and Snapdeal are already making their digital payments and services compatible with Aadhaar. "Once the Aadhaar system grows to scale, technology companies will find it tricky to prevent people from using it," Aggarwal says. Samsung is the only global device-maker currently making an Aadhaar-friendly device, a tablet that's reportedly selling well. Microsoft is said to be working with the government to link Skype with the Aadhaar database so the video calling service can be used to make authenticated calls. Fresh from battles with Washington over encryption, Apple, Google and other U.S. tech companies are less likely to compromise without a fight. For now, Indian authorities are asking politely. That could change. Earlier this year New Delhi mandated that, starting in 2017, all mobile phones sold in India must have a panic button women can push when attacked. Nandan Nilekani, who co-founded the leading tech services firm Infosys Ltd. and helped create the national authentication program, says the government could do exactly the same with Aadhaar.

This year alone, the government has banned Facebook's free web service and declined to exempt Apple from local sourcing rules and open its own stores.

"There will be a lot of pushing and shoving by the technology companies," says Neeraj Aggarwal, managing director, Boston Consulting Group, India. "It will be a battle of ecosystems, and companies would do their best to hold on to their own." A few weeks ago, government officials invited executives from Apple, Microsoft, Samsung Electronics and Google to discuss embedding Aadhaar encryption into their technology. None of the companies would comment on what transpired. Apple didn't show up at all. Ajay Bhushan Pandey, chief executive officer, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), who had convened the meeting, says the industry representatives listened politely and were non-committal. But, Pandey said he was frank about the government's position, telling his visitors: "Go to your headquarters and work this out so that we can have Aadhaar-registered devices." The biometric identity program is something of a path breaker. While the Federal Bureau of Investigation and US VISIT visa program use similar technology to respectively track criminals and foreign visitors, no other country has taken the concept as far as India. Designed in part to help thwart criminals who siphon off billions of dollars in welfare payments each year, Aadhaar helps authenticate millions of poor citizens so the government can send money in lieu of food, fuel and fertilizer subsidies, as well as pension and guaranteed work payments directly to their bank accounts electronically.

Tim Burke of BetterCloud suggests a few best practices for Google Apps admins in the space. By Andy Wolber | September 14, 2016, 8:42 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Andy Wolber/TechRepublic Tim Burke, director of IT for BetterCloud, has seen first-hand the challenges that administrators of Google Apps for Education face. They must manage accounts for hundreds, thousands, or sometimes tens of thousands of teachers and students every year. Google offers tools and settings that make things easier, but people don't always use them. "A lot of educational admins are not following some of the best practices," said Burke. "They're leaving a lot of value on the table." I spoke with Burke about his experience and suggestions for Google Apps for Education administrators. The following tips were drawn from our conversation and edited for clarity. 1. Manage your Organizational Units Burke: "Maintaining a clean, accurate Organizational Unit (OU) structure is one of the fundamentals of running a Google Apps domain. You can turn on and off every individual [Google Apps] service via OU. A lot of time you'll see some services turned off for the students, but left on for the teachers. So in your OU structure, split off your faculty from your students. For example, certain schools have policies where they just don't want students using their personal phones. They don't want that Google Apps account tied to an iPhone or to an Android. So, they turn off mobile device syncing for students, but leave it on for faculty. There are different ways that you can do your Org Unit structure. If it's a single location, do it by graduating year. The nice thing about that is that—unless a student gets held back a year—their graduating year doesn't change." 2. Configure your apps Burke: "It's always a challenge. You want to protect your students from being distracted and from anything that isn't age appropriate, but you also want to be able to empower your teachers. One school set their OUs for K-5 to disable Google Chat, because they didn't want their younger students having access to it. But once you got into middle school and your OU changed, then you had access to [Google Chat]. By default, Google likes to leave things very open. For example, if you create a brand new Google Group, by default everyone can email [the group]. And I had customers where they had an email group that was meant for teachers only, but students were emailing it. ... The admin just hadn't taken the time to set it up properly." SEE: Private school's Chromebook program explains why Chromebooks have captured nearly 20% of the educational market (TechRepublic) 3. Manage your Chromebooks Burke: "Kids love Chromebooks. A lot of schools have rolled them out. They're really great devices. They're such great devices that they started disappearing. There's a setting in the Admin Console where not only can you remotely wipe a device if you know it's lost, but Google also has this thing called forced re-enrollment. So these devices enrolled on the Google Apps domain get stolen, someone else tries to wipe it, and they can wipe it, but it will boot back up and you'll need to login with an active Google Apps account on the domain it was registered with initially. Basically, forced re-enrollment is a permanent tie between that Chromebook and your domain, so that if it walks off it can't be associated with a personal Gmail account. It can't even be used unless someone in the domain signs back on. For every apps domain, I recommend that you turn on forced re-enrollment." 4. Discuss your Acceptable Use Policy Burke: "Students and teachers should read their Acceptable Use Policy. ... It's really important whether you're a student or a teacher to know what is permitted and what is not. These accounts don't belong to the student, they belong to the school. One school used our tool to provision all their students and users a couple weeks before the school year started, but they sent the credentials for first login to the parents—along with the Acceptable Use Policy and a one-page document on how to have a conversation with your child about the Acceptable Use Policy. [It] covered what you're supposed to use your Google Account for, and what you're not supposed to use it for. It was a really interesting way to force that discussion that I don't think a lot of parents have with their children." SEE: Acceptable Use Policies (Tech Pro Research) 5. Simplify Google Apps management I asked Burke what BetterCloud offers that the Google Apps Admin Console doesn't provide natively. Burke: "Our biggest feature is bulk management: Being able to export your entire directory to a Google Sheet and then hide users, or suspend users, or change their OUs, or change their email addresses, or reset their passwords. You can do all of these things in bulk right within Google Sheets. Must-Read Cloud Why there's no compelling use case for hybrid cloud Pokemon Go: How the cloud saved the smash hit game from collapse Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy For example, I saw one domain that hadn't deprovisioned all the students that had graduated. They had almost 2,000 user accounts of students that had graduated from high school still active. They used our tool to deprovision those accounts. We have a new product that's currently in beta right now that we're calling Workflows, which allows you to take triggers that we can pick up from Google and then automatically take actions on things. You can have a workflow, 'if student added to Grade 5 OU, add to Grade 5 Google Group,' so you can tie OUs and Google Groups together. We have data loss prevention (DLP) that works near real-time. You can setup alerts that look for certain phrases or regular expressions. For example, you could write a regular expression that matches Student ID numbers and flag it using BetterCloud, then have BetterCloud take certain actions, such as fire off an email, remove the document entirely, or change the owner. We also have email monitoring. It silently forwards a copy of one email received from one mailbox to another mailbox. We've seen cases where schools have used email monitor to track student abuse of email—where a copy of every email sent from a 'problematic' student goes to the assistant principal." SEE: Google Apps vs. Office 365: A side-by-side analysis (Tech Pro Research) 6. Collaborate with Google Apps Burke: "The one thing that is absolutely game-changing is the real-time collaboration in Google Drive: Having students able to self-organize and all sit in the same document at the same time. And, being able to go back and forth via comments in Google Docs with your teacher is really valuable. I've [also] seen schools that have one shared calendar for the football team, and one shared calendar for the swim team. It's a really powerful way to organize things that happen to fall outside of school hours. A lot of schools are still booking their media rooms or conference rooms or their laptop carts manually. You can very easily do that as a Calendar resource in Google Apps." What do you think?

Google Launches Android Hacking Contest with $200,000 Prize GO Contest will take place for a six-month period, includes prizes for remote code execution flaws on Android devices Sep 14, 2016 16:50 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Google announced yesterday a six-month-long hacking contest named Project Zero Prize, free to enter, during which security researchers will be tasked with developing an exploit chain capable of compromising Android devices. Everyone is free to enter, but only the first researcher that delivers a working exploit will receive the contest's top prize, which is $200,000. Second place gets $100,000, while third place will get at least $50,000. Contest will take place side-by-side with Google's bug bounty program Google already runs its famous Vulnerabilities Rewards Program (VRP), the company's in-house bug bounty system, that dishes out monetary rewards for security researchers who file security bug reports. The contest will take place in parallel with the Google Android VRP. If a researcher wants to participate in the Project Zero Prize contest, they must file a bug report with the Android VRP for all the vulnerabilities they plan to use in their exploit chain, otherwise, their entry will be disqualified. Google said that it would reward researchers for all the bugs submitted to the Android VRP, which they did not use in the final exploit chain. To foster competitiveness between participants, only the first researcher that files a bug report for an Android vulnerability will be allowed to use it. A panel of judges will decide the winner To win the big prize, researchers have to achieve an RCE (remote code execution) state on multiple devices running various Android OS versions. The researcher will know only the devices' phone numbers and email address. To participate, researchers have to be 13 years or older. They can submit multiple entries, but they'll win just one prize. A panel of judges will decide the winners. Below are the contest's exploit requirements. Full contest rules are available here. “  Entries must consist of a full exploit chain providing access to third-party application files in internal storage on both Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X devices from a remote vector, and a document explaining how the exploit works, including every bug in the chain.  ” “  All vulnerabilities in an entry must have been reported in the Android Bug Tracker using this link prior to submission.  ” “  Exploits targeting any version of software available on up-to-date Nexus 5X and 6P devices throughout the Contest Period are eligible.  ” “  Entries should be sent to project-zero-prize@google.com. Once an entry is deemed complete and eligible, we will arrange a time a with the participant to demonstrate their exploit on live devices. The devices will be loaded with eligible software versions requested by the participant, and they will be provided with an email and US phone number on T-Mobile for the device. Each device will have a third-party application written for the purposes of the Contest installed, and this application will have written a file containing a token to the internal filesystem (path provided at time of entry). The entrant will then have one hour to provide the tokens, if the tokens are provided, the entry will be considered a winner. Winners (but not entries) will be posted as soon as they are verified.  ” “  If an entrant does not manage to obtain the tokens, but has a valid entry, they may submit again, but any entries that have been received in the meantime will get priority for prizes.  ” “  Entries where the user must open an email in Gmail, or open an SMS in Messenger are eligible, otherwise no user interaction is allowed.  ” “  Exploit chains must be practical from an attacker perspective. Entries that take an excessive amount of time to run, substantially interfere with use of the device, give clear indications of attack or are otherwise impractical may not be accepted, at our discretion.  ” “  The same bug chain must be used on both devices, except in the case where one device has a security feature that the other does not, in which case unique bugs may be used.  ” “  Exploits based on vulnerabilities reported before September 13, 2016, or reported by individuals other than the entrants are not eligible. Submissions that include bugs that have already been included in another entry are not eligible. In the case of a chain containing a duplicate (previously reported) bug, we will contact the participant, and give them a chance to resubmit.  ” “  Entries must include a list of everyone who contributed to the entry (though entrants can choose to remain anonymous when we announce the winners), and entrants can only win one prize.  ” “  Winning entries are not eligible for other vulnerability rewards programs at Google. Unsuccessful entries will be considered by those programs.  ” “  Entries for which any portion has been been disclosed to any party other than Google or vendors affected by vulnerabilities included in the exploit are ineligible. In addition, entries may be disqualified if any portion of them are disclosed to any party other than Google or affected vendors before 90 days have elapsed since submission.  ” It's safe to say that Google is looking for the next Stagefright bug, and is willing to pay to have it. Companies like Zerodium, the HackingTeam or the NSO Group also pay infosec researchers for Android zero-days if they find them useful. Prediction: Google's P0 Android $200k bug bounty will be collected by a Chinese team from Qihoo 360, Tencent or Baidu. — the grugq (@thegrugq) September 14, 2016 #Android#hacking contest#Android vulnerability#zero-day#Google subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news DualToy Windows Trojan Secretly Sideloads Apps on Android and iOS Devices Rogue Android App Can Be Used to Reveal Phone Owner's Real Identity New CallJam Android Malware Discovered on Google Play Store New Android Security Patch Level System Is a Convoluted Mess Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China - Update OnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

Today Google gave an update on the rollout schedule for some devices. The Android 7.0 updates for the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 LTE should begin “in the coming weeks,” but there’s no exact date for the rollout quite yet. That’s according to a statement from Google given to Android Police. As with most software updates, Android 7.0 is going out in stages, and it looks like it’ll take at least a few more weeks for Nougat to hit the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 LTE. That’s kind of a bummer, especially when other Nexus owners have been enjoying Nougat for weeks now. However, I’m sure that Google has a good reason for holding off on these updates, like fixing bugs and ensuring that performance is good, so N6 and N9 owners should try to be patient. Have you gotten an update to Android 7.0 Nougat yet? If so, how is it treating you?

Many young businesses, and smaller operations, often find it difficult to justify a hefty marketing spend. Once overheads have been paid – premises, staffing costs, office supplies and so on – there’s often little left in the kitty to spend on marketing, so anything you can do for free is well worth it. We asked Telegraph Small Business Connect readers to share their tips on how to market on a zero budget. Here’s what they said: 1. Use online communities to profile customers “Get online and start looking for communities related to your niche or places where potential customers may hang out. Use these communities to research buyer persona and guide your content strategy. A decent SME community on LinkedIn is a useful research tool and can even deliver the odd lead.” Tip by David Vallance, inbound marketer, Digital Impact 2. Get mapped by Google “Claim your free Google My Business account. This is important, especially for local businesses, because search results will often include a map pack with three local businesses on it. Google My Business is what feeds these results, so if your business isn't on there, you won't show up on the map results." Tip by Rob Watson, digital marketing consultant, Click to Sale 3. Remember that time costs money “Social media accounts are free to create, but costly in terms of time spent on them. Utilise free tools such as Hootsuite for social media management, Buffer for social media scheduling and Buzzsumo for content marketing research to manage your time and budget efficiently.” Tip by Carla Bradman, head of marketing, Johns & Co 4. Piggy-back on big stories “A big event that creates online chatter can offer a strong opportunity to get your business out there. Being reactive on Twitter costs nothing, especially if you can pair it with some smart design as Oreo did during its infamous Super Bowl tweet. Beyond that, survey your customers and audience to acquire data that you can tie into an ongoing event or story for public relations purposes. Many brands used this approach to capitalise on the noise surrounding Pokemon GO.” Tip by Richard Paul, outreach and campaign manager, addmustard 5. Build deeper relationships with existing customers “With a little extra effort, your existing customers can become your biggest supporters. It doesn't have to be complex: send them a simple, personalised thank you email and ask them how you can improve their experience of your business. They will love the attention and you will learn lots from them.” Tip by Sybil Wong, head of marketing and communications, Sparrho 6. Collaborate with other brands “Reach new audiences by striking contra-marketing agreements with brands of a similar size. They will be just as keen to reach your audience in exchange. But make sure their audience is of interest, and consists of your target audience. Also ensure that you both offer a comparable level of exposure by researching their reach across their website, newsletter, social media and offline.” Tip by Elaine Farrell, digital communications specialist, Hackney Mama 7. Offer free insights “Join relevant industry Facebook groups and provide lots of free value in the form of the information you provide. Help people who are stuck. Offer advice on how you’ve tackled similar situations. Become known as the go-to expert in your field so that people learn to trust your advice and knowledge. This may ultimately lead them to work with you when their budgets allow.” Tip by Charlotte Moore, food and fitness copywriter, That Copy Girl 8. Guest blog “Guest blogging is an ideal way to get your name out there. It’s something people often overlook, but it's a great way to expose your ideas to a wider audience. You might have a blog yourself, but getting a decent amount of visitors to it can take of time and effort. Seek out sites that accept guest bloggers and well-written articles. If you manage to have a post published, make sure to include a link to your website.” Tip by Emma Saldana, freelance writer, writtenbyems Next week our small business tips will be focused on how to convert footfall into sales – email anna.isaac@telegraph.co.uk with your advice Follow Telegraph Small Business Connect Free membership Telegraph Small Business Connect is a specialist community dedicated to helping small business owners and directors.

SUBSCRIBE Common PPC mistakes and how to avoid them Columnist Laura Collins lays out five mistakes she commonly sees in paid search and explains how to avoid them. Laura Collins on September 14, 2016 at 10:14 am More I was once asked to list my favorite PPC mistakes. To me, this seemed like a contradiction in terms; I don’t hold any of the mistakes I’ve made in particularly high regard. Perhaps a better phrase to use would have been common PPC mistakes. Because mistakes, no matter how hard we try, are common. We’re all human and therefore capable of human error. And the world of PPC is rapidly evolving with new, ever more sophisticated features and updates. With all those shiny new bells and whistles to explore, it can be easy to forget the basics. Here I take a look at what I’ve found to be the most common mistakes in PPC accounts, along with some guidance on how to avoid them. Two kinds of mistakes There are two main categories into which the mistakes I’ve listed below could fall: accidents, or misuse of best practices. Accidents are the result of human or occasionally technological error, where there is no question that a mistake has been made. On the other hand, some readers may find themselves disagreeing with some of the best practice “mistakes” I’ve included in here. A lot of people run PPC campaigns differently, whether we’re comparing agency-level best practices or individual account management techniques, but I believe avoiding the mistakes I’ve listed here will benefit the overall health of your campaigns. Common PPC mistake #1: using broad match Many people — including Googlers — would disagree with me here, but I think using broad match is a mistake. When auditing or taking over new accounts, it’s consistently the biggest cause of wasted spend and irrelevant traffic. It simply doesn’t provide you with enough information about a user’s intent to serve them the most appropriate ad. Even if we take ridiculous search queries out of the equation for a second (I once saw a search for “margarine” matched to “body butter” in broad match), there are still problems. Broad match leads to regular cross-matching between ad groups. The example below shows how a search for “red dresses” could trigger an irrelevant ad for red skirts. The keyword “red skirts” has a higher ad rank than “red dress” and is broadly related to the search query “red dresses.” This means the user is served the wrong ad, meaning they’re less likely to click through — and if they did, they’d end up on the wrong landing page. Of course, adding “red dresses” as a negative keyword to your “red skirts” ad group could solve this problem, but that would be incredibly time-consuming across all keywords and ad groups. And it could be avoided altogether by using phrase match. Common PPC mistake #2: not using audiences correctly The mistakes it’s possible to make with audiences could fill an article themselves, but there are a few that regularly pop up in account audits. Incorrect targeting settings Think very carefully about what you’re trying to achieve with your RLSA or customer match lists when applying them and choosing from these two options: “Target and bid” means that only users who are in your remarketing lists will see the ads in this ad group. This is a great option to choose if you’re bidding on terms that would usually be too expensive, and you want to limit your exposure to a narrower audience — or if you want to serve specific ad messaging to previous visitors. “Bid only” is the right option if you just want to adjust bids for previous visitors in response to performance. It is incredibly easy to make the wrong choice here or accidentally leave the default setting of “Bid only” enabled. This could result in either a sudden drop in traffic and revenue from a key area or huge spend where you weren’t expecting it. So make sure to double-check this for every ad group. Using audience exclusions A robust remarketing strategy, whether in search or on the Google Display Network, will most likely involve the creation of multiple lists, many of which could overlap with others. An “All Visitors — Last 30 Days” list, for instance, will contain the users that also sit in the “All Visitors — Last 7 Days” list. That in itself is not a problem, but when it comes to creating your campaigns, you need to remember that ideally, you only want a particular user to be targeted by one ad group. Otherwise, your data is meaningless, and you could end up paying more for users than is necessary. This means always excluding shorter/more granular lists from ad groups that are targeting broader audiences. So if you have two ad groups, one targeting visitors from the last seven days and the other visitors from the last three days, make sure exclude your three-day list from your seven-day ad group. If your two ad groups are product viewers and basket abandoners, exclude the basket abandoners from the product viewers ad group. Everyone who’s abandoned a basket must have viewed a product before that point, so no need to target them twice. Building the right size lists You need 100 users in a remarketing list to use it for GDN activity and 1,000 to use it for search. Outside of those limits, it’s pretty much up to you. But it’s all too common for people to get carried away building every list they can think of without considering what size they could be. Many end up too granular and are unusable in search campaigns, in which case you need to stretch out your durations or look at less granular audiences. There probably isn’t a need for a list of people who abandoned a DVD in their basket last Tuesday — the last 30 days might do. Conversely, that robust remarketing strategy I mentioned above does require the creation of multiple lists. The results you’ll see from a user who visited your site and bounced straight off 29 days ago will differ hugely from results from someone who abandoned their basket yesterday; don’t just target them all with a blanket bid and creative in one ad group. Let the volumes of traffic that you’re seeing on the site indicate just how granular you can afford to go with your remarketing lists. And make sure to check on and react to list volumes, rather than letting redundant lists languish in your account. Common PPC mistake #3: using accelerated ad delivery This one is the source of much debate among PPCers: standard or accelerated delivery. Do you set a daily budget and let Google decide how to distribute that budget across the day to ensure you’re on all day? Or do you allow your ads to serve as often as possible, even if that means your daily budget runs out at 9:00 a.m.? At first glance, option one seems better; but when you think about it, what does that option really mean? Let’s simplify for the sake of argument and say your campaign budget is £24/day, and your bids are set at £1. If Google estimates you’re going to gain one click per hour throughout the day, it may only serve your ad, say, 30 times per hour. But what if 1,000 searches are occurring for keywords in that campaign every hour? You’re missing out on 97 percent of them because Google has decided you can’t afford it, and you have no idea how valuable those impressions could be for your business. On the other hand, if you were using accelerated delivery, then learned the day after you launched your campaign that your budget had run out after the first hour, you could take action. Clearly, you need to decrease your bids or increase your daily budget in order to appear for the entire day. Standard delivery creates the illusion that you can “afford” to be appearing all day. But you can’t — Google is deciding when to show your ads instead of you. Whichever delivery method you choose, you run the risk of spending beyond your means. But accelerated delivery alerts you to this fact much more quickly and puts the control back in your hands. Common PPC mistake #4: setting up automated rules incorrectly Sales don’t always occur between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.; even if they do, it may be in a completely different time zone. But thanks to automated rules, there’s no need for anyone to be up until 11:00 p.m. on Christmas Eve making ad changes. It can all be set up to run in your absence without a hitch — as long as you’re careful. First of all, make sure every setting on your “Create rule” screen is correct. And by that I mean double-check yourself, and get someone else to check over the settings for you. A load of sale ads going live on the wrong day can lead to huge problems: Are you applying the rule to selected ads or to all ads in a campaign? Should the rule be limited to ads with a specific label? Is this rule running daily, or just once? There is no such thing as being too careful here. Also bear in mind that your rule could run at any time during the hour you’ve set. So if your sale ends at 2:00 p.m., and you don’t want sale ads potentially still live at 2:58 p.m., then leave yourself an hour’s grace at either end. Common PPC mistake #5: going over budget Nothing is surer to annoy a client or boss than overspending, but it is often and easily done. Speaking from experience, an account manager could, at any one time, be managing several clients and hundreds of different campaigns. This makes it almost impossible to manually keep track of budgets and spot potential overspends yourself. Instead, you need to make budget tracking as simple and automated as possible so that it can be monitored easily and excessive spending reined in quickly. By creating a script to export month-to-date spend into a Google doc, in combination with some simple Excel formulas, anyone can have a budget-tracker document for each client. It looks at previous spend and calculates projected spend for the month, giving you an indication of whether you need to increase or decrease spend. If you work to an overall budget, it can be very top-level, or you can work to specific budgets for different campaign types, as long as you use consistent naming conventions across all campaigns, e.g., if you have a budget for remarketing campaigns which you need to keep track of, make sure “remarketing” is in the name of every campaign that needs tracking. Final thoughts One mistake certainly doesn’t make a bad account manager. Unless you’re reading this on your first day, you’ve probably been there yourself. But there are small changes we can all make to ensure those little mistakes are happening much less often. Using a combination of care and attention, automation and another set of eyes should help to keep your campaigns in check and make for a happier workplace.

SUBSCRIBE Using social metrics + SEO + questions to create content that drives inbound traffic How do you create great content that captures organic search and social traffic alike? Columnist Matthew Barby explains his method for identifying content themes and topics. Matthew Barby on September 14, 2016 at 9:55 am More Content marketing delivers results when it addresses what potential customers are searching for and sharing on social media. Content marketing delivers great results when it addresses what a large number of customers are searching for that your competitors are not covering. So, how do you find out exactly what customers are looking for in search and social and identify potential competitive gaps? In this article, I will show you how to: analyze SEO data for your topics, and uncover winning content ideas; validate your content ideas with social engagement metrics; and use forums to identify trending questions related to your topic. How to analyze SEO data for your content marketing topics You can use related keywords and long-tail search results to identify exactly what customers are searching for (search volume) and understand potential competitive gaps. Let’s run through an example for “commercial real estate.” A great way to start is using a tool like the Moz Keyword Explorer for your topic: The four colored bars give a lot of insight into which topics (or, more accurately, customer searches) to build your content around. In general, the perfect topics to target have high Volume, low Difficulty, high Opportunity and high Potential. Here’s what all of those mean: Volume is average monthly searches for your topic. Difficulty is Moz’s algorithm run for how hard it is to land on page 1 of Google (the Promised Land) given current competition on page 1. Moz looks at Domain Authority and SEO quality of existing results and gives you a 1–100 score. Opportunity is relative click-through rate for the first 10 organic results versus ads/verticals/maps and so on. This score is higher when ad competition is lower. Potential is Moz’s combined estimate pulling together all three metrics (Volume, Difficulty and Opportunity). You can use this when picking and choosing from several options to create your content map. You can then dive deeper into potential keyword suggestions and try out a few interesting related topics. The more niche you go, the lower the difficulty tends to be (ability to rank higher in SERP). I find Moz’s “Potential” metric tends to be understated for smaller brands targeting more niche keywords, as it underestimates actual search volume for your content (It will be considered for related searches): While Moz Pro is a great tool, it costs money. Currently, the lowest-priced tier runs $99/month. If that’s out of your budget range, fear not, as there are other more affordable (even free) options. Here’s an example from kwfinder.com: You will notice they provide keyword recommendations, overall search volume, and difficulty via “seo competition.” I really like how they give this score. Here’s how they break it down: 0 – 9: “go for it” 10 – 19: “super easy” 20 – 29: “easy” 30 – 39: “not hard” 40 – 54: “possible” 55 – 74: “hard” 75 – 89: “super hard” 90 – 100: “don’t do it” This is one example of a lower-priced offering, and price is based on usage, with free, $12-per-month and $25-per-month options. Another great free tool is Google AdWords keyword planner. One drawback is that Google is focused on paid ads versus creating content for ranking organically. Competition and CPC are still great indicators of how focused others are on specific keywords, meaning those with higher search volume and lower CPC and competition are more likely to be better targets for content marketing and ultimately earn higher organic search results placements. In order to get the most value out of this research, it’s important to build content for search. To improve SEO, make sure to use your targeted keywords in the URL, title and headings (h1, h2 and so on) of your content where possible. How to validate your content marketing ideas against social media metrics Driving traffic via organic search results is only one part of the equation, and social is becoming a more important source of referral traffic. A recent report by Parse.ly (registration required) found that Facebook drove more referral traffic than Google: I used Lumanu to pull together data around average social engagement metrics per piece of content (blogs and articles) for “commercial real estate” and a few longer-tail themes (also surfaced in Lumanu) which I found potentially interesting. Lumanu is a startup launched in a early 2016 which gives insights into content performance and identifies influencers for any topic. When a user enters a search topic, Lumanu leverages machine learning to provide content recommendations. For example, Lumanu’s “Themes” analyzes all content found in the Lumanu index which is related to a user’s specified topic (e.g., “commercial real estate”) and uses natural language processing to suggest themes based on high-performing content related to that topic. I highlighted two themes above — “commercial real estate for startups” and “virtual reality in commercial real estate” — as they have relatively high engagement on Facebook and LinkedIn. As you can see, based on average social engagement, “commercial real estate for startups” has much higher potential than “commercial real estate” (which is interesting, as Moz showed the reverse for Google search volume). This means that more people search for a phrase which contains “commercial real estate,” but more people engage with content on social media written about “commercial real estate startups.” (Note: Engagement is measured by likes, comments and shares.) Lumanu builds the social engagement metrics from the bottom up (that is, by analyzing all content related to a particular topic). This is a valuable tool to peek inside the walled gardens of Facebook and LinkedIn. (This tool runs $100/month for its deep analytics offering but does offer a seven-day free trial, as well as a completely free content discovery tool.) How to use online forums to identify additional questions and topics to cover Forums are a great way to come up with content ideas and connect with potential customers. For example, when I looked for topics related to commercial real estate on Quora, I came across this thread: Answering this question costs nothing except your time and is a great way to show thought leadership and put your perspective (and brand) in front of potential customers. By looking through the answers, you can see the number of times a response has been viewed and get a good sense of the overall traffic Bring SEO and social data together to improve inbound Remember that search and social together account for the majority of referral traffic, so it is worth optimizing for both. I have found that they are not mutually exclusive in planning and tend to complement each other. You can find hidden signals while taking a holistic view of what customers are searching for and engaging with on social.

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive.. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Gmail outage hits US, Europe 0 Share: Tech Culture by Alfred Ng September 14, 2016 9:53 AM PDT @alfredwkng Up Next Is MacBook Pro perfect? No, but it's worth $3,000 to me Enlarge Image The outage smacked people on both sides of the Atlantic. Photo by Screenshot by CNET of Down Detector Gmail went down Wednesday across the world for millions, with people in the US and UK apparently hit the hardest. The disconnection immediately became a disruption for work flow and Gchat conversations in the thick of the US workday. The search engine giant confirmed that its extensive email network experienced a service disruption starting at 8:16 a.m. PT. "We're investigating reports of an issue with Gmail. We will provide more information shortly," Google wrote on its Apps Status dashboard. "Based on reports, it affects only Google for Work Gmail users." Google did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. As a suggested workaround, the company recommended disabling Gmail Service in your Admin Console UI, saving the changes, turning it back on and saving the changes again.

 Google's self-driving car project is losing out to its competitors BI Intelligence Sep. 14, 2016, 12:16 PM 1,299 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also This fully autonomous AI company could be crucial for self-driving cars All lobbyists have been cut from Trump's transition team Ben Carson declines role in Trump administration because he 'feels he has no government experience' This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. In the increasingly crowded race to put self-driving cars on the road, Google is lagging behind, reports Bloomberg. Google’s project, once at the forefront of self-driving car development, has recently been losing employees to other companies in the field. Started in 2009, Google’s autonomous car project has yet to release a vehicle or even announce plans to do so. In comparison, Uber will soon begin testing vehicles on public roads in Pittsburgh, and numerous automakers, tech companies, and ride-hailing services have announced partnerships to develop autonomous driving technology. Google CEO Larry Page’s insistence on building and perfecting a fully autonomous vehicle before bringing a product to market is likely why the company has yet to move beyond the research stage. Page aims for a vehicle that would not include a steering wheel or pedals, setting the car apart from rivals’ current offerings and raising the specter of new and increased regulatory challenges. Companies across the globe are racing to develop self-driving vehicles in a way that could transform the current car ownership model. Google, Tesla, and Uber are among companies developing autonomous vehicles that can potentially be summoned by owners or other riders, driving themselves from a parking space to a user-selected location. Uber's test in Pittsburgh and NuTonomy's test in Singapore are taxi-based variants of this idea. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, identifies technological hurdles, consumer openness, and regulatory barriers as the chief inhibitors to deploying a driverless taxi service, which we expect to see on the roads by 2020. This, however, is only one model of the shared mobility economy, while Google may pursue an alternative means of releasing and managing autonomous vehicles that is more in line with their approach to other sectors. Since the start of 2016, automakers, tech companies, and ride-hailing services have been racing to create a driverless taxi service. This service would mirror how an Uber works today, but there wouldn’t be a driver. So far, the race has been brutal, as companies jockey for position by spending billions to acquire/invest in companies that will help make a driverless taxi service a reality. Uber recently took the pole position by announcing it would begin piloting its self-driving taxi service (with a driver still behind the wheel) in Pittsburgh later this month. But other companies, including almost every automaker, are quickly catching up as we reach the mid-way point in the driverless taxi race. For the past two years, BI Intelligence, Business Insider’s premium research service, has been tracking the progress of the self-driving car space. As our reports have shown, the evolution is happening much faster than many expected, but there are still many barriers that have to be overcome before driverless cars become a reality. John Greenough, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, has compiled a detailed report on driverless taxis that analyzes the rapidly evolving driverless taxi model and examines the moves companies have made so far in creating a service. In particular, it distills the service into three main players: the automakers who produce the cars, the components suppliers who outfit them to become driverless, and the shared mobility services that provide the platform for consumers to order them. Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: Fully autonomous taxis are already here, but to reach the point where companies can remove the driver will take a few years. Both Delphi and nuTonomy have been piloting fully autonomous taxi services in Singapore. Driverless taxi services would significantly benefit the companies creating them, but could have a massive ripple effect on the overall economy. They could cause lower traffic levels, less pollution, and safer roads. They could also put millions of people who rely on the taxi, as well as the automotive market, out of a job. We expect the first mass deployment of driverless taxis to happen by 2020. Some government officials have even more aggressive plans to deploy driverless taxis before that, but we believe they will be stymied by technology barriers, including mass infrastructure changes. But it will take 20-plus years for a driverless taxi service to make a significant dent in the way people travel. We believe the services will be launched in select pockets of the world, but will not reach a global level in the same time-frame that most technology proliferates.

Pop stars such as Coldplay and Lady Gaga will hail part of the plan as a new weapon to bring a fair fight to YouTube, the Google-owned video service that they say is sapping the music business. But the reform plans have attracted the fury of filmmakers and start-up investors who see it as a threat to European innovation and a wrong-headed favour to powerful media groups. "I want journalists, publishers and authors to be paid fairly for their work, whether it is made in studios or living rooms," Juncker said as he gave his annual State of the Union speech. "Whether it is disseminated offline or online, whether it is published via a copying machine or commercially hyperlinked on the web." The overhaul is meant to bring European copyright law up to date with the digital age to make the world's largest trading bloc more competitive in a tough global field. One major change would force internet portals such as Google or Reddit to pay newspaper publishers a licence fee when using small extracts or snippets of news content -- most notably on Google News or Huffington Post. "The commission's plan to create a copyright for news publishers in Europe is a significant and historic step," said Carlo Perrone, head of the European Newspaper Publishers' Association. But opponents say this idea punishes smaller publishers and is highly ineffective, as proven when both Germany and Spain created similar systems with neither case producing the badly needed life support to starved newspapers. "How we share and use the news is in danger. (This plan) won't lead to more income for news sites, let alone journalists," said MEP Daniel Dalton, a conservative from Britain. -'Backward step'- Google, whose news service is the principal target of the reform, said the proposal was a "backward step for copyright in Europe". "It would hurt anyone who writes, reads or shares the news," said Caroline Atkinson, Google's vice president for Global Policy. Another divisive proposal is a push to make national broadcasters, such as Sky in the UK or RTL in Germany, provide online content -- including films or sports -- Europe-wide, instead of just at home. In another highly criticised change, the commission is asking that video platforms, such as YouTube or even Facebook, use technology that can track violations of copyright and shut them down. Cracking down on YouTube is a key demand of some of the world's biggest music artists who said in a letter to Juncker last June that YouTube was stealing value from streaming services, such as Spotify. Google said it was already working with copyright tracking software, but warned against rules that would force platforms, including Facebook, to mass filter all content. "This would effectively turn the internet into a place where everything uploaded to the web must be cleared by lawyers before it can find an audience," Google's Atkinson said. The raft of proposals is sure to trigger a furious fight with lobbyists. It must go to the European Parliament and EU states for approval, which could take months or years. © 2016 AFP 0 Comments To This Article Leave a Reply Most Read Trumpist coalition marching on Western d...

Even Google Search Suffers from XSS Flaws GO Google to security researcher: Nice catch! Sep 14, 2016 15:55 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  French security researcher Issam Rabhi has identified a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Google's Search interface, something that many have thought to be impossible after so many years of probing by other security experts. The reason why Rabhi managed to identify this "unicorn" is because the issue wasn't in Google's classic Search section, but in the custom widget the company introduced for the Rio Olympics. The company still uses the widget today to show final results from the recently concluded Olympic Games, but without the XSS issue, which they have patched in four days after it was disclosed. Issue was easy to exploit via social engineering According to Rabhi, who works for French security company Sysdream, the issue affected only the French version of the Google Olympics widget, and is what experts call a reflected XSS (also known as self-XSS, first-order XSS, type 1 XSS, or non-persistent XSS.) This means the attacker has to convince a victim into accessing a Google link which already includes the malicious code passed inside the URL's parameters. Since Google already uses quite lengthy URLs, this shouldn't have been a problem. When Rabhi informed Google of the issue on August 5, the company's first response was "Nice catch!" Google fixed the XSS on August 9. Not all companies regard XSS issues as dangerous While many companies might dismiss XSS bugs in their bug bounty programs, these issues are the stepping stones to more serious intrusions. XSS exploits allow attackers to collect cookies and XSRF tokens for more intrusive attacks, which allow them to compromise and hijack a target's accounts. Of course, not all companies take these issues seriously. One of those who don't is Microsoft. Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of web security firm High-Tech Bridge, told Softpedia that Microsoft refused to consider an XSS bug they've discovered as a security vulnerability, in the first place. The issue, detailed here, is a self-XSS in the Microsoft Dynamics CRM, which the company declined to patch, according to Kolochenko.

REUTERS/Vincent Kessler 1/2 left right European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker arrives to address the European Parliament during a debate on The State of the European Union in Strasbourg, France, September 14, 2016. REUTERS/Vincent Kessler 2/2 By Foo Yun Chee and Alissa de Carbonnel | BRUSSELS BRUSSELS European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced measures on Wednesday to rein in the world's technology giants, improve broadband speeds and cut the cost of internet access, trying to rally popular support for an EU battered by Brexit. The reforms are likely to shift some wealth from internet services such as Google and Facebook to European telecom groups, which have largely missed out on the tech sector's surging growth and have lobbied hard for more flexible rules that would give them more money to invest in faster broadband access. They complain that Google, Facebook's WhatsApp, Microsoft's Skype and other services have made billions by piggy-backing on their networks for free. Among the changes, Juncker wants to roll back European Union rules that bar the likes of Deutsche Telekom, Orange and Telefonica from co-investing or sharing network capacity. The Commission would expand rules covering security and confidentiality for phone providers to internet-based communication services. "We propose today to equip every European village and every city with free wireless internet access," Juncker told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, without giving more details of how the EU would help to achieve this goal within the next decade. The plan would also extend the copyright powers of publishers, music artists and other content owners to seek a share of the revenue which internet services make from linking to publishing snippets of content such as news. Juncker said the EU would also help to protect the personal online data of EU citizens through legal framework changes. The Silicon Valley tech giants are accused by European consumer groups of stockpiling users' data for commercial ends. The unveiling of Juncker's reform plan starts what is expected to be a fierce fight among EU lawmakers, member states and industry groups before it can become law. INTERNET SETBACK The plan will add weight to accusations from across the Atlantic that EU measures in recent years to protect competition and privacy and crack down on illegal state aid are targeting the U.S. tech giants unfairly. Critics, including U.S. President Barack Obama, have said the Commission is using tighter regulations against Silicon Valley companies in the hope of creating regional versions of Google or Apple. Last year, Obama dismissed these moves as "commercially driven", taken because European tech firms "can’t compete" with U.S. rivals. The tech industry expressed its displeasure on Wednesday. EDiMA, a trade group backed by top U.S. and European tech firms ranging from Airbnb and Candy Crush game maker King.com to Amazon and Google, called the copyright framework more 1916 than 2016. "It does not reflect the current environment in which users access and consume content online and lacks the ambition called for by most European stakeholders and consumers to realize a Digital Single Market," EDiMA said in a statement. Juncker's plans, highlighted in his annual State of the Union address, will be seen as an effort to counter euroscepticism by showing how technocratic institutions in Brussels can deliver improvements to people's lives. The Commission's broader efforts to create the "digital single market" are seen widely as favoring domestic telecom and media companies. Only eight of the top 100 global tech companies are headquartered in Europe, according to an A.T. Kearney study. Some of Juncker's consumer-friendly measures are also likely to impact the telecom industry, including a plan for free mobile roaming and wireless internet in cities across the EU. In a surprise move this month before the speech, Juncker withdrew proposals to limit the number of days consumers can use their mobile phones abroad without paying extra fees after criticism that the rules favored telecoms firms. He ordered the draft to be revised in what allies and officials said showed the EU executive wanted to be seen to listen to voters three months after Britons opted to leave the bloc. COPYRIGHT STORM Juncker said that the EU would work to defend people's right to privacy, saying: "Europeans do not like drones overhead recording their every move, or companies stockpiling their every mouse click. In Europe privacy matters." His copyright proposal could give publishers more bargaining power with Google when demanding payment from the world's most popular internet search engine. The outlines of this proposal stirred controversy when they were leaked last month but Wednesday's plan provided few specifics. "The creation of content is not a hobby, it is a profession," Juncker said. "As the world goes digital we have also to empower our artists and creators ... I want journalists, publishers and authors to be paid fairly for their work." Google called the plan a backward step for copyright in Europe that would limit its ability to help news publishers generate advertising revenue by sending traffic their way via Google's Google News and Search properties. "After all, paying to display snippets is not a viable option for anyone," Google Vice President for global policy Caroline Atkinson wrote in a blog. The Society of Audiovisual Authors, speaking on behalf of media licensing rights groups, praised elements of the package. However, it said the plan failed to provide an "unwaivable right to remuneration" for European film, TV and multimedia screenwriters and directors to make a living from their works. Benoît Machuel, General Secretary of the International Federation of Musicians, said: "What we need is a right for all performers to be paid each time a performance is used online on iTunes, Netflix or Spotify." Grassroots internet rights groups said the draft proposal to extend copyright for news publishers even to short sections of news repeats the mistakes of laws passed in Germany and Spain, which hurt publishers and internet users alike. "We now have a proposal that is poison for Europeans' free speech, poison for European business and poison for creativity," said Joe McNamee, Executive Director of European Digital Rights. "It could not conceivably be worse." The EU initiatives got a thumbs up from ETNO, the European telecoms operators' association whose members include Orange and Telefonica. "We need to ensure that the new Code (proposal) provides technologically-inclusive incentives, allowing our members to deliver a further increase in broadband investment," ETNO Chairman Steven Tas said. The telecoms industry had already lobbied against the burden of the original proposal of allowing them to charge extra only for clients who use their phones abroad for more than 90 days a year or 30 in a row. The European Consumer Organisation welcomed Juncker's reforms but expressed concerns they would favor dominant market players and do little to lower prices on international calls. "Consumers need operators to compete with one another in the market to deliver innovative services at cheaper prices," its head Monique Goyens said in a statement.

X Jean-Claude Juncker outlines free EU roaming and wifi plan Telecoms firm lobbying for more flexible rules allowing them to boost revenue Wed, Sep 14, 2016, 15:25 European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker delivers his “state of the union address at the European Parliament in Strasbourg”: The commission also proposed reining in internet giants such as Google, Facebook’s WhatsApp and Microsoft’s Skype by extending telecoms security rules to web-based apps. Photograph: Jean Francois Badias/AP         Irish telcos remained tight-lipped yesterday on new EU plans for free mobile roaming and wireless internet in cities across the bloc. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker highlighted the initiatives in an annual state of the union address that sought to counter Euroscepticism with concrete examples of how technocratic institutions in Brussels can deliver improvements to people’s everyday lives. Telecoms firms, including Irish companies such as Three, Vodafone and Eir, have been lobbying intensely for more flexible rules allowing them to boost revenue and invest in costly fast broadband to help the bloc catch up with the US and Asia. The plan, part of a drive to create a “digital single market” in the EU, suggests all European households, rural or urban, should have access to superfast connectivity offering download speeds of at least 100 mbps, while all urban areas as well as major roads and railways should have uninterrupted 5G coverage. The Commission also proposed reining in internet giants such as Google, Facebook’s WhatsApp and Microsoft’s Skype by extending telecoms security rules to web-based apps. Incumbent operators Analysts, however, argued the plans largely favour incumbent telecom operators and media firms over the technology companies. Some of the plans could force tech firms to channel revenues from internet services to their telecoms rivals. Only eight of the top 100 global tech companies are headquartered in Europe, according to a AT Kearney study. The unveiling of Mr Juncker’s reform plan starts what is expected to be a fierce fight among EU politicians, member states and industry groups before it can become law. “When you travel in Europe with your mobile phone, you will be able to feel at home anywhere in Europe thanks to these new roaming rules,” Mr Juncker told the European Parliament in Strasbourg. In a surprise move this month before the speech, Mr Juncker withdrew proposals to limit the number of days consumers can use their mobile phones abroad without paying extra fees after criticism that the rules favoured telecoms firms. ADVERTISEMENT Alto, the Irish umbrella group that represents non-Eir firms, gave a cautious welcome to what it called a review of the EU telecoms regulatory framework, while noting the preservation of market power and greater access to incumbent would be crucial to safeguarding competition. “Reinforcing the Significant Market Power (SMP) access regime currently in place, which is based on regulatory obligations on dominant operators, is an important element to achieve our goal of a Connected Society,” Alto chairman Ronan Lupton said. – (Additional reporting by Reuters)       Topics: Jean Claude Juncker Eu European Commission European Consumer Organisation European Parliament European Union International Federation Of Musicians Airbnb Amazon Apple Deutsche Telekom Edima Etno Facebook Google Microsoft Netflix Spotify Telefonica Whatsapp Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Facebook finds three errors in calculating advert effectiveness Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of Gaelic Games Ciarán Murphy: Castleknock GAA club prove that sometimes less is more Business Qualtrics in Ireland: ‘Our granny made us come here’ Sponsored HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business European and US stocks fall as dollar hits 13-year high 20:07 Clonmel family seeks removal of receiver over property assets 20:05 Most European indices decline led by falls for banking stocks 19:55 Car finance firm raises €25m for lending 18:43 MetLife to create more than 200 jobs at Galway campus 18:37 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

Now they want your help punching holes in Android. The plan to get independent hackers interested is simple enough: they’re offering a big pile of cash. $200,000 to be precise, which is double Google’s previous maximum. To claim the cash, all you have to do is figure out how to remotely execute code on a Nexus 6P or 5X running Android 7. You can chain together any exploits you want to hijack the device, but you have to be able to do it with only two pieces of information to start with — its phone number and the email address it’s registered to (OK, technically that’s four things since you also know it’s a Nexus 6P or 5X with Nougat installed). $200,000 sure sounds like a lot of money, but remember that these are the same kinds of exploits that groups such as the NSA and firms like Isreal’s NSO Group want to get their hands on. NSO charges big money to break into phones — several hundred thousand dollars per device. Google also realizes, regardless of the difficulty, there may be more than one way of achieving a remote exploit using this limited information. So the prizes reflect that. The first person or team to achieve it gets the full $200,000. However, the second proven exploit gets $100,000 and beyond that there’s ongoing $50,000 payouts available. I’m sure Google hopes Android isn’t vulnerable enough to get that far, though. Hopefully the Project Zero Prize is big enough to attract the kinds of submissions they’re after. It’d be nice if these exploits wound up in Google’s hands so that underlying vulnerabilities can be patched and make the Android ecosystem a little bit safer for us all.

It took until last week for the Nexus 6P’s OTA to fully roll out, and we’re still waiting on updates for the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 LTE. Now the company has confirmed: we’re going to have to keep waiting… This response came to Android Police who confirmed that the update was going to roll out “in the coming weeks”. Many have speculated that Google was dropping support for these devices, but that is not true by any means. Rumors had made the rounds claiming that Google was rolling out Nougat for the 6 on September 12th, but that didn’t come true. We don’t know why the updates have been delayed on these devices, especially since the developer preview has been available for both. Odds are Google discovered some last-minute issues with the updates and needs time to get things fixed before pushing it to the masses. In the meantime, you can still install the final Nougat developer preview on either device which is stable for the most part and doesn’t differ too much from the final release.

We think Google is close to launching Penguin 4.0, the real time version, because they are working on an announcement for it. But Google estimated launch dates in the past, expecting it to go live late last year and it didn't so they stopped estimating. Google's Gary Illyes said yesterday that yes, Google does have a date for the Penguin release. He said this on Twitter - here is the tweet: @rankingbyseo @JohnMu @rustybrick yes— Gary Illyes (@methode) September 13, 2016 The date may have come and past, so we are not sure if this is anything new. In fact, Gary added that he is sure he said Google had a date before: @rustybrick @rankingbyseo @JohnMu sure. I said that before many times— Gary Illyes (@methode) September 13, 2016 Pedro Dias, former Googler, said Google has a date for every launch: EVERYTHING at Google has a scheduled release date https://t.co/PlWGsUwIOy— Pedro Dias (@pedrodias) September 13, 2016 Yea, but my big question is what is the new date for Penguin 4.0's launch. No one but those at Google know this. Even if we did know the date, does it matter? Google can and has pushed off this launch time and time again. Forum discussion at Twitter. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: New: Google Schema For Courses   Comments: Anon User 09/14/2016 12:37 pm Sure, they have a new date for it every week. The Truth 09/14/2016 12:39 pm Not sure why they would need a new Penguin. Black Hat spammers, certainly do not rule the serps these days. Those spot are reserve for fortune 500 companies, & any website that Google Ventures has a stake in. Jack Duncan 09/14/2016 12:45 pm Well I think we know they won't pre-announce it. There's obviously something brewing/brewed and it's in their interest to confuse and confound SEO's. I think it's already part of the core algorithm and sometimes these big updates are just a bunch of things at once and it may or may not include penguin. I'm not going to go so far as to say that John flat out lied to everyone last week but if this whole thing was Penguin related then it certainly would likely have started over the weekend. I'm still not convinced this is Penguin either in US or EUR from what I can see. I think Penguin is already part of the Core Algo. sd 09/14/2016 12:45 pm To people caught by Penguin 3 out of the cold, dark, dungeon of Penguin Hell. Steve cull 09/14/2016 12:52 pm it would be good if Google was transparent for once. There is no reason not to announce a date, links and data surely must have been calculated by now they have had 2 years to get this data together. The Truth 09/14/2016 12:55 pm You know Google does not care about those people. Releasing websites from Penguin is not part of Google's itinerary. Anon User 09/14/2016 12:56 pm Gary crys when you call him a liar so I doubt he has lied. Anon User 09/14/2016 01:03 pm The reason they don't announce it is because trying to launch this beast without totally annihilating the SERPS is like trying to nail down a jelly. They will announce it when they can scrape together some coders that know what they are doing and can fix it. They are also short of a project manager that can manage projects. Jack Duncan 09/14/2016 01:18 pm Not talking about Gary tho...John is the one who specifically said weekend wasn't penguin (which was the most flux). I don't believe this is penguin I believe it's a combo of updates that's based more on personalization and localization. GrinningPenguin 09/14/2016 01:22 pm This is Google pulling the puds of all of the Penguin spammers. newyorker_1 09/14/2016 01:53 pm This article reminds me of a clickbait article from another website. The title was "MMA champion knows the name of his next opponent" and when you click on it you realize that this guy really knows the name but he won't tell us. So the whole article was about him knowing the name. Billy Mays 09/14/2016 02:09 pm What you gonna do with SEroundtable when they finally make the update, just shut it down? Maybe startup a site dedicated to AMP next instead of penguin? Barry Schwartz 09/14/2016 02:10 pm Good question. Maybe sell out and work for Google? whatsheorderfishfilet 09/14/2016 02:22 pm Barry -- I know you have a background/header designed for the site when Penguin is released. Don't lie. Barry Schwartz 09/14/2016 02:23 pm I do not, but that is a good idea. I’ll have that worked up. Barry Schwartz 09/14/2016 02:28 pm Could have been worse, I could have sent you to https://goo.gl/SsAhv Anon User 09/14/2016 02:32 pm You have got loads of time. Don't stress. FNadmin 09/14/2016 02:35 pm Can we have a penguin as a site cursor. Barry Schwartz 09/14/2016 02:37 pm You guys are stressing me out. :P Dawn Anderson 09/14/2016 02:49 pm That wouldn't be so bad. I like Rick Astley :) Ralph Macchio 09/14/2016 02:56 pm They do have standards. You're too Black Hat. Bill Lambert 09/14/2016 02:59 pm The date for P4 is 9-23-16. Matt "The God" Cutts 09/14/2016 03:38 pm Wake up! Jack Duncan 09/14/2016 03:59 pm How did you arrive at that date? Harambe 09/14/2016 04:52 pm There is so much fuss about sites that need to recover from Penguin. My questions is why did you buy those crappy links to begin with? It's not like someone held a gun to your head. Richard 09/14/2016 04:55 pm Not every webmaster is at fault. Harambe 09/14/2016 04:57 pm Don't talk to me about placing blame. Anon User 09/14/2016 05:09 pm LOL. McDonalds are in need of new employees, you sound well suited for at least a try out. Harambe 09/14/2016 05:17 pm Yep, I'll be working beside everyone that sells link packages on Black Hat World. So what did time did you want me to come in for training Sherlock? Anon User 09/14/2016 06:22 pm Drop by any McDonalds close by. They are all looking for your calibre. You will probably start off cleaning the tables and work up to flipping patties in a year or so. Harambe 09/14/2016 06:41 pm Oh, no I want to wash lettuce with you. Mambo Man 09/14/2016 06:53 pm Keep waiting, guys! Google will let you back in some day. HAHAHAHAHA! JUST KEEEEP WAITING! Anon User 09/14/2016 06:58 pm I have my chef wash my lettuce and I really don't think you are qualified to handle fresh vegetables. Guest 09/14/2016 07:09 pm How about those who don't care about links at all, but got hit with a butt load of crap links from a negative seo attack. Seriously, my site had barely gotten off the ground and was hardly a real threat to anyone, yet someone spent the time to post links all over every shady website or open forum they could find. Spent a while disavowing everything, but no use there. Harambe 09/14/2016 08:40 pm I find it hard to believe that someone who uses free coffee shop wifi everyday has a chef. But I have been wrong before. Anon User 09/14/2016 08:49 pm Being wrong does not exclude you from that job at McDonalds. They don't care as long as you can clean them tables after an acceptable amount of training. Just drag yourself down there and change your life. Gautam Dhanani 09/15/2016 04:34 am Yahh.. almost waiting from last 1 year.. they should release date.. Ethan Brown 09/15/2016 05:27 am The perfect position for barry at Google is to hatch out the penguin eggs for every Easter. Anon User 09/15/2016 05:43 am There are no known cases of negative SEO affecting a good site that has not previously been involved in some kind of link building. Not one site! So, if what you say is true then please share the details here so all the SEO's who care about these things can study your most unusual case and understand how it was possible. They could then name their findings after you as if you had discovered a new star. Now, of course, if your site was once involved in some link building against googles guidelines but you cleaned those links up and did all the disavow work needed too and some shady individual or individuals targeted your tainted site for a negative SEO attack you might well be in trouble. Negative SEO is real but only works on sites with a shady history. It's a shame there are so many of those sites out there and it is impossible to shake off that history without starting again. Koushik Chakraborty (KC) 09/15/2016 08:08 am Google has always a surprise on it's birthday. I'm guessing the launch date may be Sept 27. Chirag Thumar 09/15/2016 11:58 am Waiting from last 1 year..................................................but still No confmation date Jerry B. 09/15/2016 12:23 pm Imposter! What have you done with the real Anon User? Memj 09/15/2016 04:42 pm Negative SEO has tons of case studies on it's effectiveness. Try Googling it. The types of links matter. You can send someone 1 million blog comments and forum posts and not see a change but you send the right kind of bad backlinks in mass over a period of time and then send a request to Google, it'll drop real fast. NewWorldDisorder 09/15/2016 08:45 pm After Google is done working on the announcement, they will then announce they are working on the release date. HAHA You guys are so easily stroked along. Gracious Store 09/15/2016 11:54 pm Why is the penguine 4.0 important for webmasters. What should we do in preparation for that? Javier 09/16/2016 11:00 pm Hi Anon User, i have a site passed from 4 million os visits to 1 of organic traffic. We (we are a newspaper) always are focused in quality and known by it in our sector. We are absolutelty desesperated due algoritm sanction our site by error and we don't have any option describe to Google why sometimes their algoritm make a lot of harm to good sites by error (finally, are machines, that can fail, and need human revision to be 100% efficient). We have never do SEO things, we have never buy links or make anything rare. Problem is now we also have the logical economic problems. I dont mind to send our site url to anyone have curiosity in know what happened (we are totally clean except we dont know how to control de 5 million of links we have) due his/her help will be very gold for a people is fighting hard for quality writing. Can write me to mimi_wini @ hotmail.com where i will describe url of my website. Regards to everyone and hope Google open finally a comunication way to comunicate when a machine algorritm punish by error a site is following the guidelines and is "clean". Javier 09/16/2016 11:02 pm By the way and FYI, all the nightmare started on end of october of 2014. Richard 09/17/2016 01:43 pm The two year anniversary of Pingu 3 is coming up too... Jay Bo 09/18/2016 01:39 pm Try showing us which one of the top ten results for "negative SEO case study" proves anything. All of the so called case studies have major flaws. Some only look at the links after the attack started and "forget" that the site had lots of earlier self-made spam links. Others give no details at all and seem completely made up. There is one where a large number and wide variety of methods were tried and nothing bad happened at all. Some even have conclusions that basically say "There was no effect on ranking, but you should still worry and hire us to monitor yoiur links." I think you need to read the details and not just the click bait headlines. asdf 09/23/2016 04:04 pm DUDE! How did you know?!!?!?

Well, it didn't last long, Google is discontinuing the feature in the upcoming months. Google quietly announced on Google+ that no one will be able to make new Campaign Experiments starting on October 17th, 2016. Plus, any active campaign experiments will "automatically end and all unapplied experimental changes will be removed," on February 1st, 2017. Google recommends you end the campaign experiments yourself before this deadline but if you don't, Google will end them for you. Forum discussion at Google+.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Yes, Google Play is tracking you — and that’s just the tip of a very large iceberg Yes, Google Play is tracking you — and that’s just the tip of a very large iceberg By Joel Hruska on September 14, 2016 at 9:05 am Comment On Monday, a story broke that Google Play — the near-ubiquitous service that Google uses to distribute software within Android — was using GPS to track your every move, whether you enabled Google Maps to use location tracking or not. The only way to completely disable this kind of location tracking is to disable Google Play. This is all true, as far as it goes. But the conclusions are a bit less cut-and-dried than some publications like The Register have made it sound. Let’s break it down. First of all, it’s true that location services are integrated into Google Play and that Google actively encourages developers to use Google Play services, rather than the open-source location APIs that are part of AOSP (Android Open Source Project). This is a theme we’ve discussed before in other contexts — Google has been replacing AOSP components with its own, closed-source mechanisms for years now, and it requires the phone OEMs to agree to fairly onerous terms in exchange for shipping Google Play. This core disagreement is why Amazon forked Android and created its own distro. It’s why there’s limited overlap by default between the apps that are available on Amazon hardware and what you get with Google Android. (Amazon Fire tablets can install the Google Play Store, but they don’t ship with it installed by default and you have to jump through some hoops to get everything working). Google has a set of APIs, including location-based, that run through Google Play, and there’s some concern in the EU about how this may have impacted the competitive market. Because these APIs are linked to Google Play, you may see pop-ups in some cases that aren’t coming through specific applications like Google Maps. So how does this relate to the tweet from Mustafa Al-Bassam, the security researcher who first discussed the issue? It’s been speculated that what happened to Al-Bassam is linked to Nearby, a new feature Google described last June: [G]etting the right apps at the right time can be tough if you don’t already know about them. So, we’re introducing a new Android feature called Nearby, which notifies you of things that can be helpful near you. For example: Print photos directly from your phone at CVS Pharmacy. Explore historical landmarks at the University of Notre Dame. Download the audio tour when you’re at The Broad in LA. Skip the customs line at select airports with Mobile Passport. Download the United Airlines app for free in-flight entertainment while you wait at the gate, before you board your flight. Tagging you to download the McDonald’s application when you step inside a store is right in line with the kind of “Nearby” function Google wants to implement. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. A zero-sum game Bots and personal digital assistants are a hot topic these days. From Microsoft to Facebook, companies want to talk about how they’re building new types of software to assist with your appointment calendar, social life, grocery shopping, customer service, and ordering fast food. This is the logical extension of targeted advertising, which tries to show you advertising for things you might be interested in, based on things you’ve recently purchased or sites you’ve visited. The problem with targeted advertising is that it’s intrinsically reactive. To use one common example: Run a bunch of searches for airlines and air travel, and you’ll start seeing ads pop up for those services. But what if you’ve already booked your plans? You might see more ads for headphones after you start researching, but most people aren’t going to buy a second set of headphones immediately after buying the first. Google Nearby is meant to alert you to interesting events or places in your immediate vicinity, but it also gives Google the ability to make a connection between you and a corporation that didn’t previously exist. Google’s own example cites prompting users to download a video-on-demand application from a particular provider while waiting at an airline terminal gate — a gate that the OS knows is assigned to United as opposed to Delta or JetBlue. There are only two ways for a service like Nearby to provide that kind of customized function: Either the OS knows that you’re traveling on United because it has access to your calendar and/or email, or it knows your location. Ideally, from Google’s perspective, it knows both. This allows the OS to start making assumptions about what you’re going to do next. This idea is nothing new; stories about how “smart fridges” of the future would be able to automatically tell you when you’re out of food are literally decades old. What’s new is the way these features are tied to corporate interests and advertising. Imagine a future in which Siri or Cortana recommends flights to you based on your known travel times and preferred departure dates. Give them permission, and they’ll keep a tireless watch on flight prices for the locations you prefer. If you’re driving, your digital assistant might offer you a custom-built list of the cheapest gas along your route within a specified distance from the interstate. If Apple succeeds at killing off the headphone jack, future computers will automatically know the names of the devices we hook to them — and that means Cortana / Siri / Google Now would be able to suggest replacement headphones for you before you’ve finished the “s” in “broken headphones.” Combine drone delivery with fast food and precise geolocation monitoring, and you’ve got a system in which Domino’s can literally deliver a pizza to your exact location (provided you’re outside, anyway). Maybe you like these ideas. Maybe you feel like they’re a bridge too far and an invasion of privacy. But either way, the future that Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and other companies envision is one in which your every motion, interest, and desire are tracked, combined, bought, sold, and turned into sales dollars. So, yes. Google’s location APIs are tracking you unless you turn them off. In some cases, you may have to turn them off through Google Play rather than at the per-app level. But this is one small part of Google’s overall business strategy to create a closed-source net around Android’s open-source roots. The actual feature that probably caused the kerfuffle is itself part of a larger trend to gather details about every aspect of your life, the better to advertise and market it to companies willing to pay. Consider, after all, the value of having that McDonald’s app on your smartphone to McDonald’s (or any other company). From automatic geotagging to facial recognition, the same companies that provide essential digital services build databases of your activities, travels, and life. Said data is then vacuumed up and sold through third parties with names like Acxiom with little oversight and less accountability.

Added by Staff Reporter on 14 September 2016. Saved under News Tags: Kaspersky, Kaspersky Lab, Pokemon Go Tweet A malicious Android app, available until recently in the Google Play store and capable of seizing root access rights on users’ phones, has been downloaded more than half a million times, according to security researchers. The app, called “Guide for Pokémon Go”, can be used by attackers to install/uninstall apps and display unsolicited advertisements. At least 6 000 successful infections have taken place, according to experts from Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab. The company has reported the Trojan to Google and the app has been removed from the store. “The global phenomenon of Pokémon Go has resulted in a growing number of related apps and, inevitably, increased interest from the cyber criminal community,” said Kaspersky in a statement. The latest Trojan has malicious code that downloads rooting malware, securing access to the core Android operating system. “The Trojan includes some interesting features that help it to bypass detection. For example, it doesn’t start as soon as the victim launches the app. Instead, it waits for the user to install or uninstall another app, and then checks to see whether that app runs on a real device or on a virtual machine,” Kaspersky said. “If it’s dealing with a device, the Trojan will wait a further two hours before starting its malicious activity. Even then, infection is not guaranteed. After connecting with its command server and uploading details of the infected device, including country, language, device model and OS version, the Trojan will wait for a response. Only if it hears back will it proceed with further requests and the downloading, installation and implementation of additional malware modules. “This approach means that the control server can stop the attack from proceeding if it wants to, skipping those users it does not wish to target, or those which it suspects are a sandbox/virtual machine, for example. This provides an additional layer of protection for the malware.” Researchers have tracked at least nine other apps infected with the same Trojan and available on Google Play Store at different times since December 2015.  — (c) 2016 NewsCentral Media Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 10Brian Molefe quits as Eskom CEO 9Vodacom to launch VOD platform 9New ICT BEE code comes into force 9Social media analysis pointing to Trump upset 8New protector must probe Thuli: ANC Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Greybus Subsystem Proposed For Linux 4.9 Kernel Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 14 September 2016 at 09:22 AM EDT. 13 Comments Greg Kroah-Hartman is looking to land the Greybus driver subsystem into the upcoming Linux 4.9 kernel subsystem. Greybus was a central piece to Google's recently cancelled Project Ara modular smartphone. Greybus is an application-level protocol for the UniPro (Unified Protocol) hardware transport. Greybus is central to Google's Project Ara smartphone, which was announced earlier this month as being canned by Google. However, Greybus is supposed to be shipping in a Motorola phone "any-day-now", according to Greg KH. UniPro is the protocol for inter-module communication on these modular phones while Greybus specifies the application layer / behavior of the software interacting with the different interfaces. Many developers have been working on this Greybus subsystem for Linux for 2~3 years while he is planning to merge it for Linux 4.9. The protocol specification to Greybus is publicly available, a new version of this protocol that's already implemented by this code will be published soon, and various user-space components to Greybus are publicly available. More details on Greybus and the Linux 4.9 kernel plans can be found via this kernel mailing list message. With Project Ara being cancelled, it will be interesting to see what happens of Greybus in the mainline Linux kernel and what other Google projects or other hardware vendors may end up utilizing Greybus. 13 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The unfortunate truth is that native WordPress site search needs some work to ensure it’s delivering your readers the best results. So what can you do to improve the relevance of your site search results? Fortunately, there are a number of easy-to-use WordPress plugins that can help – no need to mess around with code, just install, activate, and tweak the settings to make them work how you want them to. 1. Search Everything With over 80,000+ active installed, Search Everything has a solid user base and it’s served me well on several websites. There are no hoops to jump through, just activate, tweak the settings, and you’re ready to go. A useful feature included is search highlighting – whenever a search query is used, users will easily see it on the results page. The main reason I started using this plugin was to stop particular pages such as landing pages and download pages being found in search results – you can choose to exclude entire categories or specific posts/pages. In the configuration menu, you have the option to choose exactly what taxonomies are used for search queries. So for example, search results can be generated by searching through custom post types, attachments, comments, categories and more. 2. Custom Google Search Custom Google Search is a premium plugin by WPMU DEV, which allows you to replace the native WordPress search functionality with Google’s Custom Search. There are a few more hoops to jump through to set up this plugin, in comparison to other plugins like Search Everything, but setup is still straight forward. Whenever I try to search a website using the native WordPress search, I usually get far better results by typing “site:domain.com” into Google. This plugin will provide a much better experience for your readers. And it’s compatible with both BuddyPress and Multisite. The only thing that I dislike about this plugin is the cost which comes in at a steep $19/month for the plugin alone, or $49/month to get all of WPMU DEV’s plugins and themes. The $49/month option holds the most value considering the sheer number of plugins you’ll get access to, although the important question to consider is – do you really need them? There are several alternatives which include adding Custom Search manually following this tutorial by WP Beginner or a free plugin; WP Google Search. 3. Relevanssi Similar to Search Everything, Relevanssi has over 80,000+ active installs and receives regular updates. Relevanssi is a free plugin with the option to purchase a premium version that gives you extra control over your search functionality. The price of the premium version starts at $49.95. In comparison to Search Everything, the setup process is more complex but should enable the plugin to provide more accurate search results. Results can be ordered by relevance or publication date and by default the plugin will use fuzzy matching when straight search terms get no hits. Fuzzy matching matches everything that begins or ends with the search term. One feature in particular that stands out is the option to add a weight to particular elements. For example, post titles are given a weight of 5 by default and comment text is given 0.75. You can also select tag and category weights, but anything else would require a premium license. You will then be able to adjust the weights of post types, taxonomies and postdates. Other premium features include WordPress Multisite support, export/import settings, guaranteed support, sticky posts, and more. But neither the free version or premium versions support BuddyPress. 4. Swiftype Search Swiftype Search is a newer plugin that boasts some powerful features. Unlike Search Everything and Relevanssi, this plugin won’t make your server work harder. Everything is hosted on their servers which is awesome. Pricing is worked out on a quota based system. You can sign up for a free account, this will give you a quota of 500 total unique pages and up to 1,000 searches per month which should be sufficient for most small websites. Paid accounts range from $19/month to $249/month depending on the size of your website and the number of queries. Paid accounts also remove branding and unlock additional features such as search analytics. One feature I particularly like is the option to customize specific search queries to make them more relevant. For example, if you notice particular terms are being searched for in the analytics, you can manually edit them to give more accurate results – if those results aren’t as accurate as you would like. You can also utilize the Swiftype platform to add mobile search to apps and leverage their API, which I imagine can be incredibly useful for developers. And for marketers, the real-time analytics functionality can deliver some valuable insights, especially for larger sites. Conclusion This is not an exhaustive list by any means; however the plugins I’ve discussed will provide something suitable for almost any situation. Whether it is the option to leverage Google’s Custom Search, provide an easy way to remove particular pages/posts from your site’s search, power the internal search of a large e-commerce site or simply improve the relevance of search results for your personal blog – you’ll find a plugin to help you. However, there are always other options out there. Are you using any of the above plugins? Or are you using a different one? What has your experience been with these types of plugins? I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments below.   Image Credits Featured Image: Gil C/Shutterstock.com All screenshots by Adam Connell.

Roger Rogerson Oh good, the self promoting post comment is gone 😀 Good topic and writeup Adam 😀 Search is an often under-appreciated area of a site. It’s something that can result in abandonment or improve retention/conversion – so it’s worth looking into, properly. To be honest, I’m amazed that we’re this far along with the internet and websites – and yet still using systems with such shoddy default search functionality. The fact that you have to add in additional plugins/mods to get anywhere near a half decent search is disturbing (not just WP, most platforms and ecommerce stores have the same issues). It’s more than worth your time/effort to go play with your search and see what you can find, and how easily. Note the time it takes, the accuracy and the relevance. Do try some of the plugins – or if you fancy a stab, have a go yourself (look at things like normalising search terms to non-plural, lower-case, alpha-numeric only, splitting the search into single terms and bi/trigrams etc. Even stemming can help (though lemmatising may do better). Then you can get clever and look at things like soundex/metaphone to cover mistakes and phonetic searches (slight fuzzing). Personally, I’ve always added my own search field, and populated it with specific terms, separated by pipes after normalisation (it will even pull in titles/keywords/date etc.). It makes for a heft column, but the results are often far superior to default functionality. Adam Connell Good to see that spam comment was removed so quick 🙂 Thanks Roger – much appreciated! I agree, so much has been made possible with WordPress, and the functionality of plugins/themes has changed a lot about how we build our websites. But, the internal search function has been lacking for a good while. Curious as to whether this will get some focus in a future core update. That’s a great point – we can only truly get a good idea of how effective site search is by trying it ourselves. I like the idea of populating a search field with your own specific terms. Do you know of a good tutorial on exactly how to do that? Thanks for sharing your insights. Best, Adam Alexander Trust “Everything is hosted on their servers which is awesome.” <– You really do believe this, Adam, do you? I don't like it that way. Not by principle, but by decision. If Google for example would offer a standalone version of Analytics for your own server… or if the comment system you use here at SEJ would be one, you could use on your servers too, would this not be awesome? You could make the decision then, to share your data or not to share it. Adam Connell Thanks Alexander, I wasn’t as clear as I should have been about that part. It’s beneficial purely in the sense that having their server’s run queries, can reduce server load on your own server. But, I see your point – having the decision to share data, or not to share it would be far better. Alexander Trust You’re welcome. And it’s not you I am worried about. ^^ Because I can guess you chose your solutions wisely. But people tend to first use and then think. Kind of everything moved into the cloud. Which is not per se a bad idea and sometimes even can be a good thing. But you can do your own “cloudy” things without an external solution. There are enough tools which allow you that, not only on your home computer or NAS, but you can even use your webserver as a cloud service for your own web-apps, that is if you know how. As I mentioned Google Analytics before. There is for example an open source solution like Piwik which you can move to your webserver and then manage nearly infinite numbers of website’s analytics. If you have a colleague who owns a webserver, he could install it, make you an account and you’re good to go. Your colleague you probably trust better than an external provider. And think of those cloud services shutting down… recently mailbox was shutdown and a lot of people got accustomed to using it. Now they have to start over. If a plugin author stops working, which happens quite often when the developers cannot monetize their work thoroughly… then what? Adam Connell Great point. That’s one of the things I dislike about the move to the cloud. Last week MailChimp was down for around 10 hours or so – not a crazy amount of time but enough to cause a problem. I imagine plenty of people were running campaigns at the time and the result was a lot of lost business, and other problems. True, I like how Piwik gives the option to use the cloud or your own server. I’d like to have a go at installing that on my VPS at some point. The only concern I have is load times being sufficient but, it warrants testing. I’m still shocked about how Dropbox handled things with Mailbox. I never used it personally, but it’s horrible when companies buy an app/tool, then kill it off. I’ve had the same issues with plugins in the past. It’s usually with premium plugins that are put on the market for insane prices like $50 for lifetime updates/support – no way is that sustainable over the long term. It seems that some plugins with these insane price points are built for quick sales and no thought to creating a real business. Fortunately, for most plugins there are similar alternatives, but migrating over is entirely manual and time consuming, to say the least. Thanks for this food for thought, Alexander – it’s a solid reminder that there is far more to deciding what tool to use than what their features are. stephen robbin Nice article. Recently i make a website using wordpress. These plugin gonna help me a lot. surely i will try these plugins for my website. Thanks a lot for sharing stephen robbin Nice article. Recently I create a website using Wordpess. your recommended plugins gonna help me a lot. I have no good idea about these plugins before. Thanks a lot for sharing such a useful information. Keep sharing Hemang Rindani Nice article. Thanks. WordPress is a great platform that can be used to manage blogging sites to some large powerful websites including e-commerce websites. Its USP lies in the simplicity. WordPress has easy-to-use interface that allows developer to control website activities. Thousands of built-in modules and plugins allows a developer to turn digital dream into reality. WordPress is highly SEO friendly and can efficiently control page indexing. However, to ensure proper indexing make sure to have a proper sitemap and submit it to google for indexing. Developers can also opt for WP indexer or WP section index tools to ensure proper page indexing. Y Design Services Search Everything is a great plugin. I like it Sara Leonard I have used Relevanssi and Google custom search for my website but not satisfied. Now, I came across searchIQ and this is the best search plugin that I have tried so far. It’s absolutely free and provides much enhanced features. Why to pay when the same thing is out there for free.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Tag News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted Journalist Account PRNewswire Distribution Search User Data Is Safe with Retargeting In the era of social media interaction, there is a large amount of private information publicly available on the internet, and the concerns about user privacy are well-founded. User Data Is Safe with Retargeting   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Retargeting, Email Marketing * Live Trigger * Online Marketing By Industry: * SoftwareLOS ANGELES - Sept. 14, 2016 - PRLog -- More and more online users are curious to know which websites have access to their private data and how they plan to use it. These privacy concerns are mostly related to large networks like Facebook or Google. The largest worldwide social network was recently sued for intercepting the private messages of users and using the information for ad-targeting purposes. On the other hand, if you post a review on Google or YouTube, don't be surprised if you'll see your data or even your photos on one of Google's 2 million advertising websites. In fact, Google even has a name for this practice: it's called shared endorsement and it means Google will use your private data for advertising purposes. Why is Retargeting Safe? Retargeting is a cookie based marketing technique: when a visitor comes to a company's website, a cookie is placed in their browser. From that moment on, when that person uses a social network associated to that cookie, retargeting starts displaying the ads of that company. Cookies have the ability to store anonymous data about a person's online behavior, and they non-personally identify information regarding the products you've recently viewed, browser or language preferences or the device type. Retargeting doesn't use your private information like your name or photos. Retargeting offers brands control Brands which use retargeting have complete control over how information is displayed to their visitors. Viewing caps offer you the possibility to control exactly how many times a certain ad is displayed to a particular visitor. This helps advertisers establish the frequency of their ads and can prevent ads from becoming intrusive or annoying at some point. Moreover, instead of seeming invasive, retargeting ads will be perceived by the visitors as natural and helpful. Retargeting ads are effective The truth is that retargeting became an effective online marketing technique and it manages to accomplish this without abusing the private data of users. In certain industries, brands that use retargeting have increased their conversion rates with 147%, compared to brands that don't, according to a study performed by Marketingland. Also, the engagement rates of the brands using retargeting are 2.5 to 3 times higher than companies which use other forms of online marketing. Moreover, recent studies prove that 72% of online shoppers abandon their shopping cart after they've added products. Without retargeting ads, only 8% will return and complete a purchase; on the other hand, with the help of retargeting, 26% will remember about the products added in the shopping cart and come back to the website to finalize the purchase. Of course online privacy concerns are well-founded, since many companies take advantage of users and their private data constantly. And this is not an assumption or an unfounded conclusion, this is a fact reflected in global events and recent news. On the other hand, brands that use retargeting can benefit of one of the most cost-effective and profitable technique of reaching certain visitors, based on their online behavior, but without intruding their private life or using their private information. This is the reason why retargeting is a safe way to use visitor information without crossing any privacy lines.

Today, everyone can get a hint of what his new reality might look like with The Bohemian Rhapsody Experience, an interactive app created by Queen, Google Play, and studio Enosis VR. A prototype version of this experience was shown at Google I/O and at May’s own event earlier this year, but the final version is now being released on Android, and is coming to iOS soon. Google describes the app as "a journey through frontman Freddie Mercury’s subconscious mind," and it’s reminiscent of the Spotlight Stories that Google has released with directors like Patrick Osborne and Justin Lin — viewers can either watch with a Cardboard headset, or use the flat screen as a "window" into the world of the video. One of the highlights of the video is actually the fact that it uses a spatialized version of the song — sound that feels like it corresponds to fixed points in the world around you, changing as you turn your head. It gives depth to a series of animations that range from detailed fantasy scenes to a neon rendering of Freddy Mercury (with his mustachio’d, post-Bohemian Rhapsody look). Similar to Spotlight Stories videos, you can also move to catch small, subtle vignettes on different parts of the screen. Somewhat unusually, the piece isn’t on YouTube, where most of Google’s other VR video lives. Google has been working on pieces like this since 2013, well before virtual reality became popular. But as we saw at I/O, its ambitions are growing — alongside things like The Bohemian Rhapsody Experience, it’s also reportedly paying YouTube filmmakers and game companies hundreds of thousands of dollars to create content for its Daydream platform, which is likely to be revealed at an event on October 4th.

By Owen Hughes September 14, 2016 13:59 BST The Pixel Launcher APK is now available in a downloadLlabTooFeR Google is all but confirmed to be ditching the Nexus brand for its upcoming pure Android smartphones, which will instead fly under the Pixel banner. In the past few days we've seen a number of credible indicators adding weight to this theory, not least a leaked Android application package (APK) for the so-called Pixel Launcher. The APK has been released by ROM developer LlabTooFeR, who published screenshots from the launcher on Twitter. Google's new launcher was first leaked in August. The latest APK doesn't appear to show any major differences since then, other than a name change and different version number. A couple of app icons appear to have been tweaked too, but that's about it. One of the standout differences in Google's updated launcher, which is expected to arrive on the rumoured Pixel and Pixel XL (previously code-named Sailfish and Marlin) smartphones in Q3, is the removal of the app drawer icon. In its place, users can swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access the app drawer. Another notable change is the doing away of the Google search bar, which is now hidden under a toggle on the home screen. For those eager to get to grips with the Pixel Launcher ahead of Google's anticipated smartphone launch on 4 October, you can download it here and take it for a spin. The ZIP file includes both the launcher APK as well as the wallpaper picker tool. Bear in mind that this is an unofficial download, so install at your own risk.

Finance Search Thu, Nov 17, 2016, 7:11 AM AEDT - Australia Markets open in 2 hrs 49 mins EU's Juncker unveils radical copyright reformAFP – Wed, Sep 14, 2016 1:18 PM AEST Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Pop stars such as Coldplay and Lady Gaga will hail part of the EU copyright plan as a new weapon to bring a fair fight to YouTube, the Google-owned video service that they say is sapping the music business The EU will overhaul copyright law to shake up how online news and entertainment is paid for in Europe, under proposals announced by European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker Wednesday. Pop stars such as Coldplay and Lady Gaga will hail part of the plan as a new weapon to bring a fair fight to YouTube, the Google-owned video service that they say is sapping the music business. But the reform plans have attracted the fury of filmmakers and start-up investors who see it as a threat to European innovation and a wrong-headed favour to powerful media groups. "I want journalists, publishers and authors to be paid fairly for their work, whether it is made in studios or living rooms, whether it is disseminated offline or online, whether it is published via a copying machine or commercially hyperlinked on the web," Juncker said as he gave his annual State of the Union speech. The overhaul is meant to bring European copyright law up to date with the digital age to make the world's largest trading bloc more competitive in a tough global field. One major change would force internet portals such as Google or Reddit to pay newspaper publishers a licence fee when using small extracts or snippets of news content -- most notably on Google News or Huffington Post. "The commission's plan to create a copyright for news publishers in Europe is a significant and historic step," said Carlo Perrone, head of the European Newspaper Publishers' Association. But opponents say this idea punishes smaller publishers and is highly ineffective, as proven when both Germany and Spain created similar systems with neither case producing the badly needed life support to starved newspapers. "How we share and use the news is in danger. (This plan) won't lead to more income for news sites, let alone journalists," said MEP Daniel Dalton, a conservative from Britain. Another divisive proposal is a push to make national broadcasters, such as Sky in the UK or RTL in Germany, provide online content -- including films or sports -- Europe-wide, instead of just at home. But film producers warn that national limits are crucial to the financing of European cinema, which survives on the subsidies raised on the success of Hollywood blockbusters. In another highly criticised change, the commission is asking that video platforms, such as YouTube or even Facebook, use technology that can track violations of copyright and shut them down. Cracking down on YouTube is a key demand of some the world's biggest music artists who said in a letter to Juncker last June that YouTube was stealing value from streaming services, such as Spotify. The proposal is sure to attract a furious fight by lobbyists. It must go to the European Parliament and EU states for approval, which could take months or years. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » BBC World Service adds 11 languagesAAP The BBC World Service will begin broadcasting in 11 additional languages in a drive to reach millions more people, … Post boss says mail reform took too longAAP Spain ups growth forecast for 2016, 2017AFP House prices affect travel: Virgin CEOAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7481 -0.0071 -0.94% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.6010 -0.0055 -0.91% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6999 -0.0041 -0.58% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Socceroos Currency Converter HMAS Darwin NZ Home loans Carrie Fisher Mortgage calculator Dwayne Johnson Budget Rent a Car WGEA pay gap Free iTunes download Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian Jasper Jackson @JaspJackson email Wednesday 14 September 2016 12.40 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 14 September 2016 18.45 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 2 months old The EU is proposing strict new copyright rules aimed at making it easier for musicians, TV makers and publishers to make money out of their work online. Google could be especially hard hit by the rules, which could force both YouTube and Google News to pay out more for hosting content or showing parts of it. Many working in newspapers and the music and film and TV industries hold Google partly to blame for lost revenues from issues such as piracy. In particular, artists and record labels have argued that YouTube has created a “value gap” but does not fairly compensate them for the huge amount of music streamed over its platform, arguing that it hides behind “safe harbour” rules governing content uploaded by users. The new rules, which are contained in proposals from the European commission for an updated copyright directive, would require video sites such as YouTube to quickly remove or get authorisation for copyrighted videos, and strengthen the negotiating position of rights holders. YouTube and other sites such as Dailymotion would have an “obligation to deploy effective means such as technology to automatically detect songs or audiovisual works”, though it praises YouTube’s efforts in the area. The directive also offers hope for news publishers, some of which have been vociferous in their criticism of firms such as Google for making money from their content without paying. New rules will recognise “the key role press publishers play in terms of investments in and overall contribution to the creation of quality journalistic content”, providing them with a stronger foundation to make aggregators such as Google News pay for republishing all or part of their article. The new proposals still have to be approved by the European parliament and council of ministers and are likely to take months to come into force. The European commission also said it was looking at ways to improve enforcement of rules including involving digital advertising companies that put ads on sites that host content that violates copyright, and companies that process payments for sites that charge for access. Google’s vice president for global policy, Caroline Atkinson, said the company disagreed with the commission’s approach. “Innovation and partnership – not subsidies and onerous restrictions – are the key to a successful, diverse and sustainable news sector in the EU,” she wrote in a blog post. “And for both European creators and consumers, it’s vital to preserve the principles of linking, sharing and creativity on which so much of the web’s success is built. The appropriate balance has not yet been struck, and Google is committed to playing its part in the discussions.” More news Topics Digital media Television industry YouTube Facebook Intellectual property More… European Union Europe Music industry Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home election 2016 US world opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home election 2016 US world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media selected crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Media › Digital media Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2016 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Newspaper publishers would get the right to curb the online use of their content, allowing them to demand payment from Google News and other sites that use clips of their articles, under new European Union draft copyright rules published Wednesday. Regulators are seeking to protect publishers and creators when their work is made available on the internet, often without payment. Publishers complain that Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., is free-riding by making profits from advertising shown next to their content. While the EU’s draft rules aim to overhaul outdated and fragmented copyright rules for the digital age, they may harm internet companies’ ability to offer services in Europe. Google shut its news portal in Spain in 2014 after copyright legislation allowed publishers charge for content used by other websites. “This proposal provides for a new right for press publishers aiming at facilitating online licensing of their publications, the recoupment of their investment and the enforcement of their rights,” the European Commission said in a text of the proposal published on its website. "Fair sharing of value is also necessary to ensure the sustainability of the press publications sector." Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the EU proposals, which would need the approval of governments and the EU parliament to become law. Musicians’ Power The EU is also aiming to strengthen musicians in negotiations with publishers, which might allow them get extra payments from an unexpected bestseller. Authors and performers often transfer their rights against an up-front payment. The EU is suggesting they should be able to see how much their work generates and should be able to renegotiate if they think the deal was unfair. Websites such as Google’s YouTube may have to more actively screen content to check for video or music that infringes copyright. They should take "appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure protection" of copyrighted works, the EU said, citing content-recognition technologies. Online sites should inform copyright holders how well such tools are working and provide ways for them to complain and seek compensation, the commission said. Google uses ContentID to verify whether videos on YouTube infringe copyright and says it has paid out $2 billion to rightsholders. The EU is separately probing Google’s power over search results, online advertising and its mobile phone software Android. Wednesday’s plan to boost the rights of publishers versus websites follows last week’s key ruling on hyperlinks at the bloc’s top court.

Its claim to fame? The fact that it is the world's first Google Tango smartphone, the first commercial attempt to instill a smartphone with exceptional understanding of what is around it using Google's Project tango vision technology. While Lenovo had announced in June that the Phab Pro 2 would be released in September, the innovative device has been delayed and will now release somewhere in the fall. Lenovo's US website has discreetly changed the availability date of the smartphone from 'summer' to 'fall'. Earlier the company had confirmed to Ausdroid that it will be launching the Phab 2 Pro only in Lenovo's well established markets like India, Indonesia, Laos, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Myanmar and the Philippines. Information on the smartphones release in other territories is unknown at the moment. What is the Phab 2 Pro? As mentioned above, the Phab 2 Pro is the world's first Google Tango smartphone. It is the first smartphone to come with motion tracking, area learning and depth perception technologies which help the device understand the world around you. Google Tango is an attempt to instill a smartphone with exceptional understanding of what is around it computer vision and area learning technologies. Specifications Display: 6.40inch QuadHD IPS display CPU: Octa-core Snapdragon 652 RAM: 4GB Battery: 4050mAh Cameras: 4 cameras. 8MP front camera, 16MP rear RGB camera, depth sensing infrared camera and a motion tracking camera Others: Fingerprint sensor, Dolby 5.1 audio capture (for 3D sound) As we can see above, the Phab 2 Pro has not 2, not 3 but a grand total of four cameras! These are the smartphone's lifeline and what makes Project Tango work. The 4 cameras together give the smartphone an understanding of what is happening around you. The Cameras can record 4K video as well as 36- degree video, a first for any smartphone. The smartphone can also capture 3D sound using Dolby Audio 5.1 capture. Price and availability The Phab 2 pro has been priced at $499 ( Roughly Rs 33,500 ) and will now release sometime in October.

According to the company, Android Marshmallow 6.0 is slowly expanding to more number of handsets and sits at an 18.7% now. Android Nougat 7.0 is yet to make it to the chart. Although a significant increase, Android Marshmallow still lies below Android Lollipop, and Kitkat on the list. As per the latest distribution numbers, Android Lollipop 5.0 and v5.1 together run on 35% Android devices, followed by Android Kitkat 4.4 with a 27.7% share. Google starts rolling out Android N update to Android One devices Google has started rolling out the latest version of its mobile operating system, Android 7.0 Nougat, to Android One devices. The move comes some two weeks after the company started rolling Android 7.0 Nougat update to Nexus devices. Android Jelly Bean on the other hand, powers 15.6% devices, while Android Ice Cream Sandwich, Gingerbread, and Froyo are placed at 1.4%, 1.5% and 0.1% respectively. These numbers were gathered by Google from Android devices accessing Google Play Store within a seven-day period till September 5. A few days ago, Google started rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to Android One devices. The version was rolled out through the OTA channel. Cherry Mobile G1 was the first Android One smartphone to have received the update. The Android 7.0 Nougat update for Nexus 6P was on hold for sometime following reports of it draining the handset's battery faster than expected. The issue, however, was attributed to a glitch at Huawei's end. Google recently released factory and OTA images for the Nexus 6P and has resumed rolling the update out.

World's lowest error rate in speech recognition Microsoft has leapfrogged IBM to claim a significant test result in the quest for machines to understand speech better than humans. By Liam Tung | September 14, 2016 -- 11:41 GMT (04:41 PDT) | Topic: Artificial Intelligence The techniques Microsoft Research used to achieve a new world-best error rate will eventually enhance the Cortana Windows 10 personal assistant. Image: Microsoft Microsoft claims to have achieved the world's lowest error rate for speech recognition, as the company jostles with Amazon, Apple, Google, and IBM to develop products that understand speech as well as humans can. According to Microsoft, its speech scientists at Microsoft Research have achieved a word error rate (WER) of just 6.3 percent under an industry-standard evaluation, using techniques that will eventually enhance Cortana. Microsoft: Conflicting data laws could cost tech companies billions Microsoft: Conflicting data laws could cost tech companies billions Microsoft simultaneously releases new Windows 10 'Redstone' PC and phone test builds Windows 10 telemetry secrets: Where, when, and why Microsoft collects your data The previous lowest error rate was 6.9 percent, achieved by IBM's Watson team, which beat their own record of eight percent set last year. Both Microsoft and IBM presented papers detailing their work on speech recognition at the Interspeech conference in San Francisco this week, where papers were also presented by Google's speech researchers. As Microsoft notes, 20 years ago the lowest error rate in speech recognition was 43 percent and that was achieved by IBM in 1995. By 2004, IBM had cut its error rate to 15.2 percent. However, these days with more research funds being funnelled into deep neural networks, tech giants are boasting error rates of well below 10 percent, but not quite at a level that exceeds human-level accuracy, which IBM estimates to be at about four percent. Google CEO Sundar Pichai last year boasted its deep neural networks helped it achieve an error rate of eight percent in speech recognition systems that power voice Search and Android. More recently, Apple's senior director of Siri, Alex Acero, a former Microsoft Research member, said error rates for speech recognition have been "cut by a factor of two in all languages", with greater gains in some languages, again thanks to its work on deep neural networks. Acero's statement was more cautious than a claim by Apple vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi which suggested that Siri had an error rate of just five percent under industry-standard tests. Microsoft's speech recognition systems were assessed against the NIST 2000 Switchboard task, an evaluation that started in 2000 to test conversational speech recognition over the telephone. Back then, it evaluated technology from SRI, the company acquired by Apple in 2010 as the basis of Siri, Dragon software, IBM, and BBN Technologies, acquired by Raytheon in 2009. Like its rivals, Microsoft has made artificial intelligence a key plank in its strategy for human-computer interaction with voice-based platforms such as Cortana set to play a key role in enabling computing in wearables, mobile, the home, vehicles, and the enterprise.

The first announcement centred on event-based optimization in Universal App Campaigns app ads, and the other around YouTube’s ‘TrueView’ service. Universal App Campaigns Google announced this morning that its app ads have now driven 3 billion installs for developers. Google previously announced crossing the 2 billion threshold at Google I/O only back in May so this extra one billion installs has been added in just four months. Facebook also announced in May that it had also driven 2 billion installs so it will be interesting to see what the social network makes of Google’s sudden growth. On the back of this announcement, Sridhar has unveiled a new update giving advertisers around the globe the ability to do event-based optimization in Universal App Campaigns. Here’s Sridhar on the next generation of Universal App Campaigns: “Across Google Search, Play, YouTube, and the millions of sites and apps in the Google Display Network, Universal App Campaigns can now help you find the customers that matter most to you, based on your defined business goals.” Universal App Campaigns works by evaluating countless signals in real time to continuously refine ads so a brand can reach its most valuable users at the right price across Google’s largest properties. As people start to engage with your ads, Google learns where you’re finding the highest value users. To use Google’s example: Google may learn that the users who tap into the most hotel deals are those who watch travel vlogs on YouTube. So, Google will show more of your ads on those types of YouTube channels. Trivago has been one of the first to test this new version of Universal App Campaigns and it found it was able to find users who were more likely to click on hotel deals in-app to book a room. As a result, Trivago acquired customers who were 20% more valuable to its business across both Android and iOS.

So on the back of this research, Google is rolling out a new YouTube campaign type called ‘TrueView for Action’. The new TrueView campaign allows brand advertisers to make their video ads more actionable with tailored to calls-to-action during and after the video, like “Get a quote,” “Book now” or “Sign up.” This is an effort to make TrueView work as a direct or performance marketing tool for brand advertisers, in addition to driving brand value. Sridhar continues… “This is especially advantageous for brands that offer products or services with high consideration, like financial services, automotive, or travel. TrueView for action can help you move your customers along the path to purchase by encouraging actions like scheduling an appointment or requesting more information.” Google will start testing this new format with advertisers throughout the rest of this year.

Google Cuts Ties With Ad Tech Firm Over Ad-Block 'Surprise' By Garett Sloane. Published on September 14, 2016. Reprints Reprints Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior VP of ads and commerce at Google. Credit: Google Google will end its business relationship with ComboTag, the ad buying platform that teamed up with AdBlock Plus, according to Google's head of ads. Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior VP of ads and commerce at Google, said the company was taken totally by surprise when AdBlock Plus and ComboTag announced on Monday that they would offer an ad exchange that served web ads to ad-blocking consumers. Related Stories POLL: Why Is Adblock Plus Suddenly Selling Ads? Adblock Plus Gets Blocked by Ad Exchanges Adblock Plus Starts an Ad Tech Platform to Sell Ads Itself "It's an uncomfortable development for us," Mr. Ramaswamy said of the fact that AdBlock Plus was "moving from being an ad-blocking company to being a driver of ads." Mr. Ramaswamy spoke to reporters about Adblock Plus before he gave a presentation on Wednesday at the Dmexco conference in Cologne, Germany. Google was announcing new tools for app-install ad campaigns to help marketers create more lifetime value from users who install apps. Google also has new YouTube formats that could drive more marketing goals from video ads, Mr. Ramaswamy said in his presentation. YouTube will let advertisers include calls-to-action that send people to a website or register them for mailing lists right in their video ads. "Advertisers can get the benefit of brand advertising while having an effective way to get consumers to actually take action," Mr. Ramaswamy said. Mr. Ramaswamy's clear denunciation of AdBlock Plus and ComboTag came after the two companies announced a new ad exchange that would place "acceptable" ads in front of Adblock Plus users. (Consumers would still have the option to set the software to block all ads, even those deemed "acceptable" or sold by Adblock Plus.) The partnership also claimed that Google and AppNexus, another major Internet ad platform, would be involved with the ad-block ad exchange. Agency holding company giant WPP has a stake AppNexus. AppNexus was also quick to distance itself from the effort. AdBlock Plus has a strained relationship with the industry. It is seen by some to be encouraging ad-blocking only so it can then charge large publishers to participate in its "Acceptable Ads" program, which allows through ads that fit its specifications for unobtrusiveness and other factors. AdBlock Plus claims 100 million-plus users, a cohort of Internet consumers that advertisers would like to reach. For its part, Google thinks the industry needs to come up with ad standards that offer a compromise with internet users. "We think ad-blocking usage is driven by a disconnect between what the ad industry thinks is an acceptable ad standard and what consumers find acceptable," Mr. Ramaswamy said. "The only way to solve this is by working together defining standards based on objective data." Too many publishers are concerned with short-term revenue objectives and could turn off users with their ads, Mr. Ramaswamy said. ~ ~ ~ CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said WPP held an investment in ComboTag; it does not.

(Report) Advertising/Marketing | Google Google Unveils Revamped Universal App Campaigns, YouTube TrueView for Action By David Cohen on Sep. 14, 2016 - 7:00 AMComment Google used the dmexco conference in Cologne, Germany, Wednesday morning to announce a revamped version of its Universal App Campaigns, as well as the new TrueView for Action YouTube campaign type. Senior vice president of ads and commerce Sridhar Ramaswamy announced “the next generation” of Universal App Campaigns at dmexco, saying that they are available globally to all advertisers across Google Search, Google Play, YouTube and the “millions of sites and apps” in the Google Display Network. Ramaswamy stressed that rather than simply focusing on application installs, Universal App Campaigns aim to deliver specific in-app activities, using hotel search app Trivago as an example and highlighting its goal of driving users to book stays. He wrote in a blog post: Like Trivago, you get to choose the in-app activity you want to optimize for, whether that’s tapping into a deal or reaching level 10, and you can use third-party measurement partners or Google’s app measurement solutions like Firebase Analytics to measure those activities. Once your in-app activities are defined within AdWords, you’ve plugged in your analytics solution and set your cost-per-install, Google will put our machine learning algorithm to work. Universal App Campaigns evaluate countless signals in real-time to continuously refine your ads so you can reach your most valuable users at the right price across Google’s largest properties. As people start to engage with your ads, we learn where you’re finding the highest-value users. For example, we may learn that the users who tap into the most hotel deals are those who watch travel vlogs on YouTube. So, we’ll show more of your ads on those types of YouTube channels. For Trivago, Universal App Campaigns was able to find users who were more likely to click on hotel deals in-app to book a room. As a result, the travel brand acquired customers who were 20 percent more valuable to its business across both Android and iOS. This is a major shift in how Google can help you grow your app business. We’re listening, and we’re no longer just focusing on the install. Our goal with Universal App Campaigns is to deliver user engagement and value for the apps you worked so hard to build. As for TrueView for Action, Ramaswamy called it a way for advertisers to add calls to action—“Get a quote,” “Book now,” “Sign up”—to their video ads, and he wrote in the blog post: Over the past few years, we’ve evolved our TrueView format to change the way video delivers value for performance marketers. TrueView for app promotion and TrueView for shopping make it incredibly easy for brands to drive downloads and purchases directly from YouTube. But what about brands with other types of conversions, like requesting a quote, booking a hotel, signing up for a newsletter or scheduling a test drive? Today I’m excited to introduce TrueView for Action: a new format that encourages users to take any online action that’s meaningful for your business. TrueView for Action makes your video ad more actionable by displaying a tailored call to action during and after your video. This call to action can be adapted to your specific use case, like “Get a quote,” “Book now” or “Sign up.” Since this is an easy add-on to your video, you can drive performance on top of all of the benefits of showing your video to an engaged audience. This is especially advantageous for brands that offer products or services with high consideration, like financial services, automotive or travel. TrueView for Action can help you move your customers along the path to purchase by encouraging actions like scheduling an appointment or requesting more information. We’re excited to start testing this new format with advertisers throughout the rest of this year. Finally, Ramaswamy announced at dmexco that Google’s app ads have now driven 3 billion installs for developers, up from the 2 billion the company announced at Google I/O in May.

Contact Us Newsletters Sales: 1-800-405-0844 Articles Customer Stories Why eMarketer Plans Product Tour Research Topics Can Social Be as Good as Search for Some Ad Objectives? And can it gain a share of search budgets? September 14, 2016 | Advertising & Marketing | Media Buying | Social Media Share Email Print In many respects, social media and paid search are ideal partners. One facilitates branding and engagement, while the other helps seal the deal by driving traffic, leads and sales, as explored in a new eMarketer report, “Search and Social Platforms: How Facebook and Others Can Steal Dollars from Search” (eMarketer PRO customers only). This cozy pairing doesn’t end there. When Facebook began selling advertising, it did so through an auction-based ad marketplace that used interest- and demographic-based targeting, which was purposely analogous to the keyword-driven auction marketplace that Google and other search engines offer. That similarity helped Facebook build an enormous advertising business by making it easy for companies to streamline the mechanics of social ad buying. But the close partnership of search and social (at least in advertisers’ minds—Google and Facebook, the primary companies in each of those channels, have never been friends) is about to be tested. In the past year, Google and Facebook have introduced ad products that borrow from each other’s playbook, and both are making mobile the centerpiece of their ad business. In another corner, Pinterest is targeting search advertisers in a bid to expand its revenue base beyond social media budgets. And on the usage side, there is mounting evidence that consumers are using social platforms for research and discovery. While this activity by no means takes the place of search, it represents a new wrinkle for marketers to consider. There is no question that search is a powerful signal of intent, and typical social media interactions provide far fewer of these signals. But there are signs that social is playing a somewhat larger role in product research and information-gathering than before. For example, research has found that younger internet users are more likely than older generations to turn to social media interactions with brands when researching a product before purchase. According to a May 2016 survey of US internet users by Salesforce, millennial respondents were five times more likely to tap into their brand connections than were baby boomers (25% vs. 5%). However, only 14% of total respondents said they used social media as a research source, so this is not a major shift in behavior. eMarketer PRO customers can view the full report here.

Credit: C_osett More like this Google scrubs Pwnium hack contest Microsoft ponies up $100K to researcher who figured out new Windows hack in 2... Google raises ante for next Chrome hacking contest to $2M Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now Google yesterday announced a six-month bug contest that will pay up to $200,000 for an Android "bug chain," one or more successful exploits of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Dubbed "Project Zero Prize," it differed from hacking contests that take place over one or two days: Researchers can submit entries from now until March 14, 2017. In that regard, Google's contest resembled the limited-time bug bounties that rival Microsoft has offered to focus on, among other areas and applications, in Windows 10's Edge browser. In the case of multi-exploit entries, Google also departed from the usual contest or bounty rules by encouraging researchers to submit each link in the bug chain as the flaws were uncovered, rather than wait until all were in place and exploitable. "Instead of saving up bugs until there's an entire bug chain, and then submitting it to the Project Zero Prize, participants are asked to report the bugs in the Android issue tracker," wrote Natalie Silvanovich, a Google security engineer, in a post to a company blog. "They can then be used as a part of submission by the participant anytime during the six-month contest period." It's in each participant's interest to file bugs as soon as possible since Google will credit only the first who submits a specific bug. Researchers must be able to hack a Nexus 6P and a Nexus 5X smartphone running any version of Android that is current during the six-month stretch. "Entries where the user must open an email in Gmail, or open an SMS in Messenger are eligible, otherwise no user interaction is allowed," the contest's rules stated. The first researcher to submit a winning bug chain will be awarded $200,000, with half of that going to the second researcher. Others will receive at least $50,000 each. Silvanovich touted the contest as not only a way for Google to quash a few bugs, but to learn more about the vulnerability marketplace. "We hope that this contest will give us another data point on the availability of these types of exploits," she said. "There is fairly limited public information about this subject, and we might be able to glean some useful data from the number of submissions." Google announced the Project Zero Prize a week after security vendor Trend Micro spelled out Mobile Pwn2Own 2016, a more traditional hacking contest that will run Oct. 26 and Oct. 27 in Tokyo. Prizes at Pwn2Own range from $35,000 to $250,000, with those targeting the Nexus 6P -- one of three smartphones on the hit list -- maxing out at $100,000. Although Google had been a co-sponsor of Pwn2Own in the past, that relationship ended last year.

This year alone, the government has banned Facebook's free web service and declined to exempt Apple from local sourcing rules to open its own stores. Now India could force companies to use technology cooked up in a government-funded lab.  BCCL The initiative is part of a national biometric identity program called Aadhaar. Millions of Indians use fingerprint and iris-scan authentication to access a range of public and private services that now includes banking. Failure to join the effort could limit the tech industry's access to a vast and growing market, but companies like Apple and Google are expected to resist opening up their phones and operating systems to the Indian registration, encryption and security technology.  "There will be lots of pushing and shoving by the technology companies. It will be a battle of ecosystems, and companies will do their best to hold on to their own," says Neeraj Aggarwal, managing director of the Boston Consulting Group in India.   A few weeks ago, government officials invited executives from Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google to a meeting to discuss embedding Aadhaar encryption into their technology. None of the companies will comment on what transpired at the gathering -- and Apple didn't show up at all.  Ajay Bhushan Pandey, who runs the Unique Identification Authority of India and convened the meeting, says the industry representatives listened politely and were non-committal. But Pandey says he was frank about the government's position, telling his visitors: "Go to your headquarters and work this out so that we can have Aadhaar-registered devices."  BCCL India's biometric identity program is something of a path breaker. While the Federal Bureau of Investigation and US VISIT visa program use similar technology to respectively track criminals and foreign visitors, no other country has taken the concept as far as India.  In September of 2010, it began collecting citizens' biometric and demographic data, storing them in a centralized database and issuing a unique 12-digit ID number to every man, woman and child. Aadhaar is the world's largest such program; as of April this year more than one billion people had signed up, or about 83 percent of the population.  Designed in part to help thwart criminals who siphon off billions of dollars in welfare payments each year, Aadhaar helps authenticate millions of poor citizens so the government can send money in lieu of food, fuel and fertilizer subsidies, as well as pension and guaranteed work payments directly to their bank accounts electronically.  iphonetech Civil liberties and citizens' groups say the program violates Indians' privacy; others warn that Aadhaar's servers could be hacked and compromise national security. But the government is moving ahead and in recent weeks has rolled out a digital payments infrastructure built on top of the program. The idea is to bring financial services to a nation where millions have never set foot inside a bank, let alone opened an account.  As India's billion-user Aadhaar jigsaw fits into place, the government plans to ramp up and add a host of other services including education and health care.  "We are doing 5 million authentications daily, and with Aadhaar-compliant devices that number will grow exponentially. There is a solid business case for technology companies to enable Aadhaar services," Pandey says. Indians would still log into their smartphones using the manufacturer's biometric authentication, typically a fingerprint or iris scan. But once they access Aadhaar using the government's encryption, the likes of Apple and Google would lose the ability to track users online, forfeiting the ability to mine that data to sell ads or other products and services. (Indian law, by the way, bars the government from collecting or using customer data.)  BCCL Tech companies will probably also object to allowing the government to install its authentication software on their gadgets for fear of security breaches and hacking attacks. Apple has strenuously resisted the US government's demands to build a back door into its operating system so law enforcement can track the movements of terrorists and criminals. "There should be clarity and provisions about security," says Amresh Nandan, a research director at Gartner Inc.  On the other hand, foreign tech companies could be at a competitive disadvantage if they don't go along because Indian companies like Flipkart, Paytm and Snapdeal are already making their digital payments and services compatible with Aadhaar. "Once the Aadhaar system grows to scale, technology companies will find it tricky to prevent people from using it," Aggarwal says. bgr Samsung is the only global device-maker currently making an Aadhaar-friendly device, a tablet that's reportedly selling well. Microsoft is said to be working with the government to link Skype with the Aadhaar database so the video calling service can be used to make authenticated calls. Fresh from battles with Washington over encryption, Apple, Google and other US tech companies are less likely to compromise without a fight.  For now, Indian authorities are asking politely. That could change. Earlier this year New Delhi mandated that, starting in 2017, all mobile phones sold in India must have a panic button women can push when attacked. Nandan Nilekani, who co-founded the leading tech services firm Infosys Ltd. and helped create the national authentication program, says the government could do exactly the same with Aadhaar. 2.3k facebook twitter reddit Comment Here Follow @indiatimes Our Channels News Lifestyle Entertainment Health Videos Sports Trending Sections india world sports weird self style Tech who we are travel food bollywood celebscoop hollywood Healthy Living Recipes Inspire Tips & Tricks Buzz Photogallery Indiatimes Lifestyle Network MENS XP iDiva Luxury Ask Men Pursuitist Specials #FRONTLINES #GOFORGOLD #INDIANAMA Other Sites News – TO CricBuzz Happy Trips Business Insider ZoomTv Gizmodo Lifehacker IGN BoxTV Gaana Online Shopping Techradar Daily Deals Gitanjali Shop Satvik Shop WHAT'S HOT ZigWheels FILMIPOP Filmfare Femina Mobile Greetings Follo Jobs Property Astrology Speaking Tree Matrimonial iTimes Ads2book TcNext Romedy Now About us Mobile Apps ARCHIVES sitemap Contact us ABOUT INDIATIMES Privacy Policy Terms & CONDITIONS Copyright © 2016 Times Internet Limited.

But deliberate pixilation of photographs could soon be rendered useless by artificial intelligence that can peer through the blurring to see what is hidden beneath. Software engineers have used machine learning to teach a piece of software to adapt image recognition techniques to recognise objects, faces and words in obscured images. Artificial intelligence could be used to defeat attempts to protect people's identity (stock image) or hide certain information in videos and photographs posted online. Researchers found it was possible to train software to recognise faces, text and objects in obscured images The software could mean that people who appear on Google Street View, for example, could be identified despite attempts by the search company to hide their identity with image blurring. KANYE'S DISAPPEARING ACT  It is a bizarre disappearing act that only the most affluent seem to be able to afford. Dozens of million dollar homes in some of the world's most exclusive areas have mysteriously disappeared from Google's Street View - and nobody knows why. They include the homes of Kim and Kanye West, Miley Cyrus, Justin Timberlake and Drake, who all reside in the suitably named 'Hidden Hills' in California, along with other gated communities. There are 648 home built in Hidden Hills, California, a gated community 20 minutes outside of Los Angeles. When users type in an address in the neighborhood, such as the stunning home at 23726 Long Valley Road, into Google Street View the entire community seems to not exists.   Video sharing website YouTube also offers a tool to blur the faces of people in videos, which could be exposed by with the new too. Similarly text that has been obscured by blurring could be identified. Writing in a research paper published on the science journal site arXiv.org, Richard McPherson, a computer scientist at the University of Texas, and his colleagues said: 'We demonstrate that modern image recognition methods based on artificial neural networks can recover hidden information from images protected by various forms of obfuscation. 'We argue that humans may no longer be the 'gold standard' for extracting information from visual data. 'Trained machine learning models now outperform humans on tasks such as object recognition.' The researchers warn that the technology could have serious implications for people's privacy online. The researchers were able to show it was possible to defeat three privacy protection technologies currently used online. They demonstrated that it was possible to unblur faces from videos in YouTube that had used the site's own blur tool.

Share this article Share 63 shares The researchers used a series of data sets to examine whether image recognition software was able to recognise images that have been pixellated using photography software or using the P3 privacy software (illustrated) YouTube currently offers a tool that allows faces or other objects to be blurred within videos (pictured). The researchers showed, however, this could be overcome using image recognition software, which can match blurred faces with those in its database The researchers were also able to unpick information from pictures that had been pixelated using common photography software like Photoshop. Finally they were also able to defeat a tool called Privacy Preserving Photo Sharing, or P3, which encrypts parts of an image that may identify someone so it cannot be seen clearly. The researchers trained their software using images of words, faces and objects. When it achieved 90 per cent accuracy they then gave it the same images that had been blurred. When they later fed the machine blurred or pixelated images it had not seen before, they found it was able to identify what was in the image 80 to 90 per cent of the time. Google Street View uses blurring to protect people's identity if they were photographed by its Street View cameras (pictured). Image recognition software may be able to defeat this though It had the least success when tacking celebrity faces that had been obscured using the P3 system. Vataly Shmatikov, a computer scientist at Cornell Tech in New York who led the research, told Wired: 'The techniques we're using in this paper are very standard in image recognition, which is a disturbing thought.' However, the software was not able to reverse the blurring or pixellation, or even recreate the pictures it was identifying. Instead it was able to use image recognition tools to match the faces or objects to things already in its database. Writing in their paper, the researchers said: 'As user-contributed photographs and videos proliferate online social networks, video-streaming services, and photosharing websites, many of them can be found to leak sensitive information about the users who upload them, as well as bystanders accidentally captured in the frame. 'In addition to the obvious identifiers such as human faces, privacy can be breached by images of physical objects, typed or handwritten text, license plates, contents of computer screens, etc.' Besides helping to reveal information that people might want to obscure in images they post online, the system could find some practical uses too. For example it could be used to help identify a person's face from low quality CCTV footage where an individual's features can often be blurred or hard to make out. The system could match the image to photographs of suspects or people in a police database. THE SECRET SITES THAT ARE BLURRED ON GOOGLE EARTH  From scaling Mont Blanc to walking the Great Wall of China, Google Earth prides itself on putting the world at your fingertips. But even Google has some parts of the planet that it doesn't want you to see. In a recent in-depth feature, news.com.au put together a list of classified regions that have left some users baffled by their disappearance.  Haarp site, Washington-Oregon border The controversial Haarp (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program) was located near the Washington-Oregon border. In 2014, The US Air Force shut down the research facility which studies an energetic and active region of the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere. The secret city, Russia There is an area of Russia in the Siberian tundra that is thickly blurred out on Google – and no one knows why. The closest city is Egvekinot, Russia; neighbour to Alaska across the Bering Strait. Portlaoise Prison, Ireland Portlaoise Prison in Ireland's County Laois is a high-security prison housing some of the country's most dangerous criminals. While it isn't blurred on Google Earth, a closer look at the image shows how the colours do not match with its surroundings. This is because the view of on Google Earth is of an old prison, perhaps so no one is able to plan an escape from the facility. The Faroe Islands, Denmark The Faroe Islands is a self-governing archipelago, part of Denmark. It's made up of 18, volcanic islands between Iceland and Norway in the North Atlantic Ocean. A large area of the islands in the autonomous archipelago-country of the Faroes are missing, including the old WWII military base on the island of Vágar. No one is sure why parts of the Faroe Islands, home to 50,000 people, are pixelated, but news.com.au suggests it may have something to do with fishing rights. Százhalombatta Oil Refinery in Hungary The Százhalombatta Oil Refinery in Hungary asked Google to be coloured green and have its building and grounds removed from satellite images – but no one understands why. What makes the matter even stranger is that the green blocks out a field of grass with nothing on top of it. Kangtega, Nepal Kangtega, known also as The Snow Saddle, is a major mountain peak of the Himalayas in Nepal. Its summit rises 6,782 metres (22,251 ft). It is blacked out on Google Earth – and no one is sure why. Some have suggested it may simply be a glitch in the system.

Some have suggested it may simply be a glitch in the system The Volkel air base, the Netherlands According to former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, there are 22 US nuclear bombs stored in the bunkers of the Volkel air base air base. They include B61 thermonuclear bombs and a device said to be four times as powerful as the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. It appears as a strange camouflage set of tiles on Google Earth.  Keowee Dam, South Carolina The Keowee Dam, on Lake Keowee in South Carolina, has been blurred by Google. It is approximately 26 miles (42 km) long, 3 miles (4.8 km) wide, with an average depth of 54 feet (16 m), and a shoreline measured at 300 miles (480 km). The Keowee Dam, on Lake Keowee in South Carolina, has been blurred by Google. Lake Keowee provides a crucial source for cooling water for Oconee Nuclear Station  'Why would they want to hide a reservoir? Could be the fact that the dam helps run the Oconee Nuclear Station,' wrote one conspiracy theorist Read more: Defeating Image Obfuscation with Deep Learning AI Can Recognize Your Face Even If You're Pixelated | WIRED Share or comment on this article e-mail 63 shares Most watched News videos Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Victoria Fritz hides her baby bump moments before giving birth Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes? 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Shocking moment Kumbuka tries to smash glass at London Zoo President-elect Trump and family dine out at famous 21 Club Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Cops shoot man holding 2-year-old girl hostage Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Little girl leaps to her sister's defense during scolding EXCLUSIVE: Blow up!

A Google Maps user posted a screenshot showing a speed limit sign in the lower left corner of the app to Reddit. Another photo, shared by Android Police, shows a similar indicator appearing in the bottom right of the in-car Android Auto interface. Android users in both the US and the UK claimed to see the new speed limit indicators, with some reporting that the feature appeared for a short time, before disappearing a day later. It's not clear when this feature will arrive officially in the app, or which countries it will come to first, but its inclusion would be a bonus for Android Auto users who have relied on other software in the past to inform them of speed limits.

You can search for a phrase or multiple phrases separated by commas, and it will return a graph with different color-coded lines. The color-coded lines represent the rise and fall in the frequency of a phrase usage during that time period. In general, the graph displays how a particular phrase is used in Google books within the selected time period. You can dig deeper in analyzing phrase usages by using wildcards, parts of the speech tags, etc in your search query to get more complex results. For example, you can use it to see how a particular word like comb is used as a noun and verb differently by appending part of the speech tag in search keyword/phrases. I will tell you more about it in next section, so keep reading. Sponsored Links How to use Google Ngram Viewer: Step 1: Open Google Ngram Viewer homepage from here. Step 2: Enter a phrase that you want to search in the first text box from the top. Searches in Google Ngram Viewer are case sensitive, that means that “Winston Churchill” and “winston churchill” will produce different results. If you just want to search a phrase and ignore its case then you can enable its case-insensitive option. You can also perform advanced searching by using wildcards, part of the speech tags, etc. I will tell you more about it in the next section of this article. Step 3: Specify the time period for which you want to know frequencies of a phrase. You can set it between 1500 to 2008. Step 4: Select a corpus of books from which you want to see the frequency of searched phrase. You can choose from 22 different corpora like English, French, Spanish, American English, British English, and many more. Step 5: Click on “Search lots of Books” button to search for a phrase and it will then display a graph with a line. To see a phrase frequency in a year, just hover your mouse on any point of the line. In case you searched for multiple variations of the phrase, then the graph will have multiple color-coded lines, each line representing one variation. Step 6: You can also customize the smoothing level of a graph as per your convenience. If you apply a higher smoothing level, then the curves of the color-coded line will be smoother. You can set the smoothing level of the graph from 0 to 50. Also see: Free  Bulk Google Books Downloader. Advanced searching in Google Ngram Viewer: As I already mentioned, you can use the advanced searching feature of Google Ngram Viewer to procure more complex results. It allows you to perform 3 advanced type of search: Inflection search, Wildcard search, and Part of speech text.To perform these searches, you need to follow a syntax, so let’s see each one of them and their syntaxes. Inflection search: It will automatically return various modifications of a word, like, if you searched for cook then in results it will also display frequencies of cooks, cooking, cooked, etc. You can simply do inflection search by appending _INF at the end of a word like cook_INF in the previous example. Wildcard search: To do a wildcard search, insert * anywhere in your searched phrase and Google Ngram will automatically replace it (*) with top 10 popular phrases as per your searched phrase. You can place * symbol anywhere in a phrase that you want to search like you can search * California. Part of the speech search: I have already told you about it, you can use this search to see frequencies of a phrase as a particular part of the speech. To do this search, append _PartOfSpeech at the end of a phrase, like comb_verb and comb_noun. You can see its results in the screenshot included below. For more help in advanced usage of Google Ngram Viewer, you can read here. Verdict: Google Ngram Viewer is a useful online tool to analyze frequencies of phrases that occurred in Google Books from a time period of 1500 to 2008. It is quite easy to use and can be used by anyone to research or get an idea on anything. You can dig deeper to search and analyze frequencies of phrases more coherently by using its advanced searching types like wildcard, Inflection, or part of the speech.

Google Maps Now Shows Speed Limits During Navigation The new feature has already started rolling out Sep 14, 2016 10:12 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google pays a lot of attention to its Maps application, considering that it's one of the most popular Google proprietary apps out there. Now it seems that the application was updated with a new and useful feature, one that shows speed limits during navigation. A Reddit user has revealed that speed limits during navigation in Google Maps are now visible, thus displaying vital information letting users know how fast they should drive in certain areas. The feature isn't exactly new, as it has been available in other similar applications, like Waze, for some time now. The feature displays the speed limit for the current area in the bottom left corner of Google Maps, just above the route info. Unlike Waze, users won't be warned if they exceed the speed limit, but at least now they would know just how fast to drive. It seems that the feature has already started rolling out to some devices and should arrive to all users in the following weeks. Google has also started rolling out a new Explore UI for its users. The new section is an alternate view for finding local businesses and attractions. The new UI includes an all-white design at the top of the screen and it trades tabs for a vertical scroll that would make it easier to parse information. Just recently, Google Maps partnered with Lyft and Gett in order to provide users with more options to find and compare the fastest route to arrive at their destination. #Google#Google Maps#Waze#Lyft#Speed limits reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Risks $7.4 Billion Fine for Violating Antitrust Regulations in the EU Instagram App Hits 1 Billion Mark in Google's Play Store Russia Fines Google $6.75 Million over Pre-Installed Android Apps Google to Roll Out Mass Transit Delays and Wi-Fi Only Features to Maps Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China - Update OnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

Google Doesn't Give Up on Social Networks, Launches YouTube Community GO Google is trying to hide Google+ inside YouTube Sep 14, 2016 09:20 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Google announced the launch of YouTube Community, a new feature of its video hosting platform that adds support for sharing text and photos, on top of the service's native video-sharing feature. Plans for this move leaked in the press last week. With YouTube Community, Google is resurrecting its ambition of conquering the social networking landscape, after the failed Google+ experiment. While Google+ had to fight and get users to visit its platform on a daily basis, YouTube already has over a billion users visiting its site every day. It now remains to be seen if they'll embrace the new Community feature, or they'll leave it to rot in a corner of YouTube's menu, like past experiments. Fighting back against Snapchat and others For its part, Google said that this feature comes in support of content creators, the term used to describe dedicated YouTube uploaders that build their own following on the site. There's been some pressure from other platforms lately, such as Twitch, Vine, or Snapchat, that have slowly drained talent from YouTube's creators base. Most of these users left because they benefited from much deeper social interaction features on the other platforms that allowed them to get closer to their followings. YouTube just got its own Facebook Wall The new YouTube Community feature is like Facebook's Wall, but for content creators. They can share pure text posts, images, GIFs, and users subscribed to their channels will receive an update, just like in the case of a video. The feature is a double-edged sword. Some users might not like the new spam coming from a channel, and if misused, some creators might end up with fewer subscribers than when they started. YouTube Community is currently in Beta, with the company inviting just a few select YouTube creators to join as it tests the platform. Below is a preview of the Community section, as seen via the YouTube mobile app.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #YouTube Community#YouTube#social network#social feed#Google subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google+ Gets a Full Material Design Makeover, New Features Google Embeds Cast Extension in Chrome Google to Lower Search Rankings for Sites with Aggressive Popups Google Will Discontinue Chrome Apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux in Early 2018 Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China - Update OnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

WileyFox Swift 2: A new champ of the 'for around £150' market Google's new VR Daydream View will cripple your phone Comment Google isn’t just interested in tracking you, or even very interested. Google tracks you with the defiant zeal of an obsessive stalker. What’s curious is that the American state seems almost as keen on the unfettered collection and use of location data as Google itself. Phones incorporated GPS silicon long before the iPhone launched – by 2007 it was a standard feature of Nokia’s mid- and high-end S60 devices. Curiously, the original “Jesus Phone” launched in 2007 with Google Maps installed – but without GPS. GPS was one of the original missing features, along with MMS and video recording. We’ve generally been aware that smartphones track us. Concerns first surfaced in April 2011, when an app illustrating the iPhone’s location record made it easy to see. What’s changed is that the collection and use of this location data now appears to us to be much more aggressive. Google simply doesn’t care about being discreet any more. It doesn’t care that users might think it is creepy. But the historical records show that Google always was pretty hardcore about location data. Never more so than in April 2010, when it emerged that Google had halted Motorola’s production lines on the insistence that Motorola used Google’s location service, rather than SkyHook’s service. It was a nuclear intervention: work on some 40 models was jeopardised. Motorola capitulated. So, too, did Samsung. Both companies had signed deals with SkyHook. SkyHook had originally come up with the idea of wardriving (as it was then called), and building up a global Wi-Fi location database from the Wi-Fi hotspots. Google took out an evaluation licence from SkyHook in 2005, figured out how it worked, and then allegedly copied it. SkyHook sued for IP theft in 2010 and finally settled the case for $90m in 2015. The company was taken over by TruePosition, a Liberty Media subsidiary, in 2014. Larry Page fumed. Why would he think SkyHook’s service, as used by Motorola, was “contaminating” Google’s data collection but Google’s data was “clean”? Answers on a postcard please. Another wrinkle in the Matrix appeared when Google’s own wardriving effort got underway. It must have seemed like a neat idea over at Mountain View to combine StreetView with a Wi-Fi snooper, and that’s just what Google did. Germany baulked at the idea. Then it emerged that Google’s Wi-Fi snooping was collecting emails and passwords, too. The FTC investigated but, quite remarkably, didn’t prosecute. The $7m fine handed down was labelled a “wrist slap” by privacy groups. The FTC later reached a controversial settlement with Google over its trade practices after FTC staff had investigated, and concluded there was sufficient evidence for an indictment. And another wrinkle The FCC has been formally regulating behavioural advertising since the 1990s. You’d think they’d be all over Google and Facebook, then, right? Actually, no. The FCC is now run by a former Obama fund-raiser, Tom Wheeler, and it can’t do enough for Silicon Valley, whether it's collectivising songwriters rights or disaggregating TV. What the FCC did this year, with little fanfare, was cripple telecoms companies and wireless networks from doing what Google and Facebook do. That’s a very odd decision. If behavioural advertising is so bad consumers need an opt-out, how come you can opt out of your ISP's profiling, but not Google’s. How could that be? Don’t count on “digital rights” groups to help you, dear citizen, when we discover that Google is funding them. Privacy lawsuits became cosy backroom carve-ups, with privacy NGOs greedy to pocket Google’s cash. Marc Rotenberg at EPIC is one of very few exceptions: the object to the conflict of interests raised by the cy pres settlements, that saw “digital rights” groups raise a privacy class action only to settle. Money laundering might be a better description. Naturally, Google regards location data as especially valuable because of its advertising potential. As we previously noted: Security researcher Mustafa Al-Bassam reported on Twitter that he "almost had a heart attack" when he walked into a McDonald's and was prompted on his phone to download the fast food restaurant's app. Microsoft was once keen on raising public awareness of Google’s creepy behaviour. Redmond sold its advertising business to AOL, so doesn’t need to monetise the personal data it collects. But it’s got much more aggressive about personal profiling under Satya Nadella. Anything you can slurp, we can slurp too, says Microsoft. It thinks AI and bots are “new user interfaces” that will become an integral part of our lives. Perhaps. But on the basis of user reaction to Google’s increasingly aggressive use of location data, you wonder. Android phones now examine your location and invite you to rate the cafes you’ve been to. Most of the guesses are correct. Google now scans your photos and find similar photos of those locations. You need to go to Maps to turn this off – but as we now know, Google will ignore you and carry on collecting that information anyway. Anecodotal reactions from people in each case is largely negative. It’s a Yuk. The future dystopia of pervasive personal tracking, that was once merely Sci-Fi, is here, but … look how shiny it is! Does yours have a dual lens? Mine does. It’s Quad HD. And all that free stuff.

Ltd, an online fish delivery startup set up just a few months before. Freshtohome co-founder and CEO Shan Kadavil would not reveal the exact amount of funding the startup received, but said it was in “single-digit million dollars”. The investment came from Mark Pincus, co-founder of NASDAQ-listed social gaming company Zynga, Google Ventures CEO David Krane, Google India head Rajan Anandan, former SoftBank director Pavan Ongole, Silicon Valley venture capitalists Pete Briger and Walter Kortschak, and former Zynga executives Cadir Lee and Alex Garden. Pincus is an angel investor in Facebook and Krane is the person behind Google’s investment in Uber. That three of the eight investors have a Zynga connection is no surprise. For, Kadavil was the India country head of Zynga before founding Freshtohome. And he has also worked with and co-founded a number of startups in the San Francisco Bay Area, which explains his other Silicon Valley connections. But that is not the only reason why tech stars from Silicon Valley have come together to seed fund this fish- and meat-ordering startup. Freshtohome differentiates itself from other food-delivery startups with its full control of the supply chain, starting from procurement. At the back end, it runs an app-based marketplace to buy directly from fishermen. Around 1,000 fishermen along the coast of Kerala use the app to participate in auctions daily at 4 am, when they return to shore with their catch. The fishermen enter their prices against the icons or images of the fish on the app. “The app eliminates middlemen and keeps our procurement cost down,” Kadavil said. This helps Freshtohome create its unique selling proposition; it delivers sea fish home within 24 hours from the time it reaches shores. Sea fish available in the market in non-coastal locations are three to four days old and are preserved using chemicals, he said. “The fish we get in places such as Bengaluru is kept in cold storage and preserved in ammonia and formalin. They pose health hazards and lack their original taste,” he said. Formalin is carcinogenic. Kadavil said the firm neither uses chemicals nor keeps fish in cold storage. It transports the fish in ice to its processing centre on the outskirts of the city. The centre has 300 workmen and delivers fish on order. The company can deliver in four to six hours after an order is placed, he said. Similarly, the startup procures chicken, ensures they are free of antibiotics, processes it and sells. “We are not a hyperlocal startup; we are hyper-fresh,” said Kadavil. Freshtohome co-founder Shan Kadavil with staff Jumping into the entrepreneurial ocean Kadavil, who spent most of his career in cities in India and abroad, had neither a network among fisher folk nor a knowledge of the fish market. His entry into the fish sale business was rather unplanned. He was running Zynga’s 500-strong Bengaluru office, its largest engineering force outside the US, before starting this venture. Like any true blue Malayali, Kadavil loved his fish. He used to order fish from seatohome.com, one of the earliest ventures in online delivery of fish. Seatohome.com founder Mathew Joseph, a veteran who also runs a seafood exporting business, had wound up his experiment with online fish sales as he felt e-commerce was not his forte. This prompted Kadavil, a loyal customer, to reach out to Joseph. Kadavil’s technological knowledge and experience of running tech companies combined with Joseph’s knowledge of seafood industry and operational expertise in the field gave birth to Freshtohome. “Our direct procurement and delivery help us offer better price to our vendors while selling at lower than the market price to the end customer,” claimed Kadavil. “We share our gain from eliminating the middlemen with both the vendor and the customer.” For instance, the Indian mackerel fish, popularly known as Bangda, costs Rs 210 a kg in Bengaluru; Freshtohome sells it at Rs 195. The website shows that prices of fish and meat items are lower by around 10% while processed meat and fish on order generally charge a premium. The startup’s efforts at ensuring fresh and chemical-free fish and meat at competitive prices helped it gain traction with a limited Facebook campaign. It claims to have added 65,000 customers in Bengaluru within a year and delivers 2,000 orders a day, with 65% customers making repeat orders. Kadavil said the company doesn’t sell on discount and makes a profit per unit. He said the hyperlocal model with just 6-7% margin will have inherent weaknesses while an online sale with a fully controlled back end will ensure 30% margins. Freshtohome recently began a pilot project in Delhi by air-shipping fish from Kochi. The company has decided to expand in Delhi and eventually start procuring fish from Gujarat or Bengal coasts. Besides Bengaluru, it sells in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram now.

Hilary Benn (@hilarybennmp) I will be standing for the post of Chair of the new Brexit Select Commiittee. We need to get the best possible deal for the British people. September 14, 2016 Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, has told MPs that Tony Blair should have circulated the Iraq war note he wrote to George Bush saying he would be with him “whatever” to cabinet colleagues. Heywood, who was principal private secretary to Blair at the time of the Iraq war, initially refused to say what he would do as cabinet secretary if a PM refused to circulate a note like this. It was a hypothetical question, he said. Bernard Jenkin, the chair of the committee, replied: “It’s not hypothetical, it happened.” Then Heywood said: I think the cabinet secretary in that situation should seek a one-on-one meeting with the prime minister to speak to them directly and say to them that he really must share this collectively. It’s going to become government policy. That’s the way the cabinet works ... I certainly agree with you that private memos from the prime minister to the president of the United States setting out what the government’s position is should have been subject to collective approval, and would be today. Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, has told MPs on the public accounts committee that the government has not committed all the money he thinks is needed for the NHS’s five-year plan. Hugh Pym (@BBCHughPym) Simon Stevens tells Public Acocunts Committee he didnt get money requested for years 2,3 and 4 of NHS Eng Five Year View September 14, 2016 Hugh Pym (@BBCHughPym) Simon Stevens says in intermediate years of 5 year NHS view theres a bigger hill to climb than first envisaged September 14, 2016 Hugh Pym (@BBCHughPym) Asked if Govt gave NHS what it asked for, Simon Stevens "theres a lot of work in hand because we didnt get what we asked for" before 2020 September 14, 2016 Theresa May has criticised the concept of “safe spaces” designed to ensure debate does not cause offence to students in universities. Nicola Sturgeon has said she finds it “gobsmacking” that Theresa May’s government is still unable to answer basic questions about its Brexit strategy, almost three months on from the EU referendum. Aid charities have expressed concerns that British aid funding will be diverted away from supporting the world’s poorest people towards facilitating trade under the new international development secretary, Priti Patel. Patel has told the Commons international aid committee that she no longer supports the death penalty. As recently as 2011 she did support it. That’s all from me for now. I will be writing a new blog, covering the Sky News Labour leadership hustings with Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith, later tonight. The debate starts at 9pm and I’ll launch the blog at about 8.30pm. You’ll find it here.

According to the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn, it has been a waste of time. Tom Newton Dunn (@tnewtondunn) Always wonder why committees bother calling Sir Jeremy Heywood. #PACAC also getting zilch from him. Tighter than proverbial gnat's chuff. September 14, 2016 But the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope and the Mirror’s Jack Blanchard have found some lines worth tweeting. Jack Blanchard (@Jack_Blanchard_) Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood says the Chilcot Inquiry was "an outstanding piece of work." He has met Chilcot and told him so September 14, 2016 Christopher Hope (@christopherhope) Sir Jeremy Heywood: Inquiry took more than six years because of the scope of the investigation from the beginning #Chilcot September 14, 2016 Jack Blanchard (@Jack_Blanchard_) Heywood says the problem was not how long it took to conduct the Chilcot inquiry, but the claims at the outset that it could be done quickly September 14, 2016 Jack Blanchard (@Jack_Blanchard_) Heywood cannot think of any way Chilcot could have been speeded up. "If you want a thorough inquiry, it's going to take that length of time" September 14, 2016 Christopher Hope (@christopherhope) Bernard Jenkin to Jeremy Heywood: The #Chilcot report "was delayed so the grass was as long as possible." Heywood denies this. September 14, 2016 Christopher Hope (@christopherhope) Jeremy Heywood: #Chilcot £10.3million was "considerably cheaper" than other inquiries - "if that is what it cost, that is what cost" September 14, 2016 Sir Jeremy Heywood.

May has refused to rule out Britons having to pay for visas to visit Europe after Brexit. Angus Robertson, the SNP leader as Westminster, asked for an assurances that May would protect visa-free travel in the Brexit negotiations with the EU, but she refused to give this assurance. May has said that an international competition will be launched to design Britain’s new national memorial to the Holocaust. It will be built in the Victoria Tower Gardens, next to the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, has condemned attacks on Polish people in the UK in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Later, on the World at One, the Ukip leader Nigel Farage accused Juncker of being selective. Referring to the killing of Arkadiusz Jozwik, Farage said: [Juncker] did refer to that awful incident, but equally he could have referred to many other dreadful things being done all over Europe. Not to mention 14 recognised terrorist attacks in the space of this year. I don’t actually think that it’s ever very wise to pick any one incident against an individual and to use it for political ends. The government has said it did not renew the contract of an American firm accused of wrongly withdrawing tax credits from claimants because its work was not up to scratch - but has ruled out an inquiry. As the Press Association reports, Concentrix’s contract to reduce fraud and error in the tax credits system will not be extended when it comes up for renewal in May 2017. Responding to an urgent question on the matter in the House of Commons, Treasury minister Jane Ellison said the firm has “not been providing the high levels of customer service that the public expect and which are required in their contract”. But she said there is no need “to go into inquiries etc etc” as the contract is not being renewed. A slide in wages growth in the month after the Brexit vote appeared to give the first warning sign that the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the referendum could harm the UK labour market. As Phillip Inman reports, the Office for National Statistics said wages growth slipped to 2.1% in the three months to July, from a revised 2.4% a month ago. When bonuses are added to the wage total, earnings rose by 2.3% during the quarter, down from 2.5%.Employment rose by 174,000 in the period, while the unemployment rate remained at 4.9%. The claimant count, which is calculated for August, found there were 771,000 people claiming unemployment related benefits, up from 763,600 in July. The former vice-chairman of the BBC Trust has expressed alarm about the “brutal” way Theresa May effectively reversed David Cameron’s decision to reappoint Rona Fairhead as chair of the corporation. Britain should have taken far more extensive and decisive action in Libya to prevent the country sliding into chaos after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, the former chief of the defence staff has said, following the release of a damning report into the UK’s intervention. A parliamentary committee has found the former News of the World editor Colin Myler and legal manager Tom Crone in contempt of the House of Commons over evidence they gave about the phone-hacking scandal. Theresa May is poised to give the conditional go-ahead to the £18bn Hinkley Point C nuclear plant.

Fired up and thinking on his feet, not just sticking to scripted lines. His best #PMQs for ages. September 14, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.11am EDT 08:11 PMQs - Verdict PMQs - Verdict: People often think PMQs is a pointless, archaic ritual but, for all the shouting and sloganising, it is remains an arena where ideas and policy gets scrutinised and no amount of wit or mudslinging can disguise a seriously weak argument. That is why Jeremy Corbyn won today, handsomely. Theresa May may be entirely sincere in her desire to create more good schools, and her point about “selection by house price” is a good one, but Corbyn successfully highlighted some of the multiple flaws with her grammar policy. Where are the experts who back it? Why do FSM (free school meal) pupils in grammar-school Kent do so much worse than those in non-grammar London? Will pupils at grammar school feeder schools be guaranteed a place? How can segregation at 11 be justified? On all these questions, May couldn’t provide an answer. It was easily her worst PMQs so far. And that’s what I thought watching it in TV from my desk. Many of the journalists who tweet and report on PMQs watch it from press gallery in the chamber and they often get a different impression because they hear the actual noise levels (which can be much louder, and much more one-sided, than you would realise from just following it on TV). And they tell me what was striking was how little support May was getting from her own side. That’s not because Tory MPs have suddenly gone all Corbynite; it’s because many of them have serious reservations about grammar schools. On the basis of today’s PMQs, and judging by what happened the last time Corbyn won a PMQs so clearly on an education matter (see 12.26pm), the chances of May’s plans being ditched, or having to be substantially amended, must be quite high. Updated at 8.13am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.49am EDT 07:49 My PMQs coverage normally leaves out Angus Robertson, the SNP leader, because he asks his questions as I’m writing my snap verdict. So here is what he asked. He started by asking if May would protect visa-free travel to the EU. She dodged the question. There was a very clear message from the British people that they wanted to see an end to free movement as it operated, they want to see control of the movement of people from the EU into the UK and that’s what we will deliver. Robertson then quoted Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator. He asked May: Does she agree with Mr Verhofstadt, the EU negotiator, and the Scottish government who want to protect Scotland’s place in Europe? May responded by saying the Scots voted to stay in the UK two years ago. It’s all very well him asking that question but only two years ago he didn’t want to protect Scotland’s place in the EU because he wanted Scotland to leave the Uk and on all of these questions - whether it’s the q of the EU referendum, the referendum on independence on Scotland, the right honourable gentleman seems to think if he asks the same question all the time he’ll get a different answer. Well, it won’t work for me and it won’t work for the Scottish people.

You want to create a manifesto, just Google “manifesto” and you will get 1000’s of samples, take one that suite your environment polish it and bingo! Even a form four high school student can perfectly do it... September 14, 2016 September 14, 2016 You want to create a manifesto, just Google “manifesto” and you will get 1000’s of samples, take one that suite your environment polish it and bingo! Even a form four high school student can perfectly do it especially with their mastering of IT, smart phones and Internet of things. Any candidate trumpeting a manifesto should first give the PDOIS a big kudos when they produced one long time ago when the Internet was non-existent. Who reads a manifesto in Africa? Not the semi-literate majority who form the majority of voters. A manifesto in Africa is meant for the consumption of the minority schooled elite. Gambians confused politics in the Western hemisphere and politics on the African Continent. They are totally different in form and context. In the Western world, politics centers on policies and programs and foreign policy. You will never hear a Western candidate campaigning by telling people I have built roads, schools, hospitals, and houses for you if the person is the incumbent seeking for another term in office or a new candidate vying to be elected. Rule of law, the independent of the judiciary and the legislative are also not part of their campaign speeches for these are acquired facts and realities and they know it is the intellect and taxes that people pay that made all of the above possible. A candidate who venture into the above propaganda will be taken to mental hospital in fact that candidate will not even pass the test of party lines primaries. This is why Western presidents age fast when elected into office because the challenged in the delivery of their mandate, whiles their African counterparts get fatter and shiner and younger, because they are not challenged and are given exclusive powers that no institution can challenge. Having these extraordinary powers conferred on them transformed them into dictators and family feuds. Whiles these campaign slogans are not a criteria in the Western world; it is the modus operandi of the African candidate campaign trails. The reason being that the majority of African still think that it is the presidents that dip their hands into their personal pockets to build the national infrastructures and the African intelligentsia are not doing a good job in enlightening the tax payers that is their monies spent by presidents except in the Gambia PDOIS. Until the African intelligentsia fight for the independence of the Judiciary and the Legislature as CONTROL institutions of the over powerful presidency, Africa will NEVER take off. Power is sweet and corrupts easily and absolute power transforms the person into a political animal generating dictators and family feuds. The power of African presidents must be reduced to the level of the Western hemisphere for them to become the SERVANTS of the people and not the masters of the people. Manifestos are the least respected by African presidents and president Macky Sall is a prime example when he accepted the “ National Charter of Benno Siggil Senegal headed by Professor Amadou Moctar Mbow of UNESCO” during the second round voting only to dilute it when elected into office. Only the House of Parliament could have rejected the diluted piece of legislature but because of party lines and the veto power of the president, the “watery law” passed despite the huge campaign against it. Having control of the national coffers and applying the “stomach politics” versus the meager resources of the Opposition parties made the diluted law passed like pay as you pass go. The African presidential candidate is entrenched in what we call the “stomach politics”. The candidate is only audible to the audience when he or she talks about food, health, schools, houses, hotels and roads etc. Since independence, politicians in connivance the corrupt technocrats and the top brass army officials conspired to keep the populations ignorant of the power of their taxes and voting cards. Until the new honest intelligentsia unlocks the TRUTH in people hearts and minds, they will remain victims of corrupt governments and politicians. As far as the Gambia is concern only a trusted charismatic leader can appeal to the people yarning for change and make them go out in large numbers to put their voting weight behind that person. Insulting, vindicating, vendetta and promise for revenge will not appeal to the majority electorate in the Gambia. It is only the promise of peace, stability and development that can appeal to the ordinary people. After 22 years Gambians know who Yaya Jammeh is so there is no need to remind people, as they are the victims. He who feels it knows it. CHANGE back to the smiling coast is the most appealing slogan to the Gambian electorate than anything else. Written By Baboucarr Bojang.

By Charlie Osborne for Zero Day | September 14, 2016 -- 07:23 GMT (00:23 PDT) | Topic: Security NopSec Google has launched The Project Zero Prize, a competition slated as a way to find and destroy critical Android vulnerabilities before attackers exploit dangerous Android vulnerabilities in the wild. Project Zero security researcher Natalie Silvanovich revealed the competition on Tuesday. In a blog post, Silvanovich said that despite the constant stream of bug discoveries coming from Google's security team, "many unique, high-quality security bugs have been discovered as a result of hacking contests." As a result, the tech giant has decided to run its own contest in the quest for interesting, severe Android security bugs. Google is asking researchers interested in competing in The Project Zero Prize scheme to focus on vulnerabilities or bug chains which would allow attackers to perform remote code execution on multiple Android devices. However, there is a catch -- Google wants you to start with only the device's phone number and email address. Exploits which successfully target any version of Android Nougat on Nexus 5X and 6P devices are eligible for the competition. If security researchers are able to find exploitable flaws which are this severe, and then submit them through the program, there are a number of prizes on offer. The first prize, worth $200,000, will be awarded to the first winning entry. The second prize is worth $100,000, and a third valid entry will earn researchers at least $50,000. Google will also consider other entries for rewards through the Android Security Rewards program. The search engine giant does not want participants to save up their bugs until the last minute. Instead, Google asks that researchers submit bugs through the Android issue tracker as they find them -- and they do not need to be a full vulnerability chain -- and these entries can then be used as part of a contest submission during The Project Zero Prize, which will last six months. Silvanovich commented: "There are often rumours of remote Android exploits, but it's fairly rare to see one in action. We're hoping this contest will improve the public body of knowledge on these types of exploits. Hopefully this will teach us what components these issues can exist in, how security mitigations are bypassed and other information that could help protect against these types of bugs. Also, we're hoping to get dangerous bugs fixed so they don't impact users." After the competition has ended, the winning vulnerabilities and exploits will all be disclosed publicly.

The Android N is now available to download for selected Nexus smartphones - Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Pixel Tablet, and Nexus Player. SEE ALSO: How to Generate Unlimited Reliance Jio 4G SIM Barcodes From Android Smartphone: 8 Simple Steps Now, the huge miss in that list will be the Nexus 5 as the company dropped support for the smartphone. As expected, the OS comes with a lot of new features such as the much anticipated multi-window mode, drag and drop text, etc. We are now covering the top 10 features of the Android N, which are worth looking at. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Multitasking Finally, Google decided to add the feature officially. Android N comes with a new multi-window mode, which is essentially seen on Samsung smartphones for ages now. You can now view and work on separate tasks at the same time with this feature. Quick Switch With the Android N, Google is also tweaking the app switcher mode. Now, the multi-task menu comes with bigger cards and the app switcher key can be used for other tasks as well like double tap to switch to the last opened application, tap and hold to switch between apps, etc. Revamped Notifications Google thinks that the widgets arena is gone and they are now concentrating on delivering feature rich notifications to their users. There are now five quick toggles and the notifications in the drawer are very helpful. You can drag the notification received to see more information. If there are more than two notifications, you can easily expand them to see the entire information. Night Mode Android N also comes with an in-built night mode which when activated applies a red filter to the entire screen to reduce strain on your eyes. Settings App Gets a Redesign There aren't many changes to the Settings apps, however, it has some nice additions worth considering. You can immediately observe some new sections on top of the menu, which shows information such as battery left, storage used, Wi-Fi network connected, etc. Also, Google added a new three-line menu to jump from one section to other section with ease. Data Saver Mode Data Saver Mode is not a new one to Android, but in Android N, it improved a lot. You can now stop each application from using data in the background, which saves your data. Call Block Finally, the call block feature is here. With the Android N, users can now block calls right from the dialer app itself without installing any third party app, which is a much-awaited addition. Zoomed Interface The new Zoomed Interface feature allows you to change the entire system's text according to users choice. It essentially changes the DPI of the display for better viewing of text. Faster OS Updates Google promises that with the Android N, users will be able to get faster updates than anyone. This feature will be useful to other manufacturers as they don't need to edit the core OS components of Android. However, this feature will not be supported by the current generation devices. Better Battery Life As expected, the Android N offers better battery life than the Marshmallow. Google added some new features to the Doze mode, which was introduced with the Android Marshmallow. Now, in the Android N, the phone no longer syncs or performs tasks in the background which ultimately saves the battery life. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

Marshmallow Climbs in Android Distribution Chart for September GO Android 7.0 Nougat is nowhere to be found Sep 14, 2016 07:07 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google has just released the Android Distribution Chart for September and we have to say that it's rather late, considering that it' almost the middle of the month and usually the numbers are released during the first days of the month. The chart doesn't come with any surprises. Google has just released September's distribution numbers and they're rather predictable. Marshmallow 6.0 continues to grow and now reaches 18.7%, up 3.5% from last month's 15.2%. The number isn't surprising, considering that many smartphones have been updated to this Android version in the past month. Lollipop 5.0 and 5.1 reached 35%, down 0.5% from 35.5% in August. Lollipop 5.0 actually lost a full point, from last month's 14.1%, while Lollipop 5.1 rose 0.5%, but this didn't help the overall decline of Android Lollipop. It's probably the last month that we'll see Froyo in the distribution chart Next in line is Kit Kat, which now reaches 27.7%, down 1.5% compared to the distribution numbers presented last month. Jelly Bean 4.1.x, 4.2.x and 4.3 all dropped 1.1 points together, reaching a collective share of 15.6%. Additionally, Ice Cream Sandwich lost 0.2% reaching 1.4% this month, while Gingerbread also decreased 0.2% to 1.5% share of the Android market. Froyo continues to hold its ground at 0.1% and this might actually be the last Android Distribution Chart that will include Android 2.2 Froyo. Google didn't include Android 7.0 Nougat in this month's distribution chart, and that shouldn't come as a surprise. Nougat started rolling out just a few weeks ago, specifically two weeks before the numbers were prepared. What's more, the Android 7.0 Nougat OTA update for Nexus 6P was pulled shortly after the release, as the version caused some battery and performance issues for such smartphones. Moreover, the Nougat build for Nexus 6 hasn't even been pushed out yet. Android's latest version will most likely appear in the distribution numbers to be posted in October. #Google#Android Distribution Chart#Android 7.0 Nougat#Android 5.0 Lollipop#Android 6.0 Marshmallow subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Marshmallow Usage Reaches 15.2% in Android Distribution Chart for August Marshmallow Usage Reaches 13.3% in Android Distribution Chart for July Marshmallow 6.0 Hits 10% Mark in Android Distribution Numbers for June Android 6.0 Marshmallow Leaps to 7.5% Market Share, Lollipop Stagnates Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China - Update OnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Yet more bad news for Flash as Google Chrome says goodbye (sort of) 18 May 2016 5 Adobe, Adobe Flash, Google, Google Chrome, Security threats Post navigation Previous: Apple’s big security update – but some iPad Pro users say they’ve been “bricked” Next: Fake, violent YouTube video makers imprisoned by Bill Camarda 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Adobe Flash, long the Swiss cheese of the security world, took another meaningful step this week towards well-earned extinction. Google has quietly passed the word that HTML5, rather than Flash, will soon become the default experience in Chrome wherever the choice is available. Flash Player will still be bundled with Chrome for the time being, but by the end of the year it’ll be hidden away like some embarrassing distant relative, listed neither in the plugins list or as a supported media (MIME) type. Per Google’s presentation: When a user encounters a site that needs Flash Player, a prompt will appear at the top of the page, giving the user the option of allowing it for a site. If the user accepts, Chrome will advertise the presence of Flash Player… refresh the page… [and] honor the user’s setting for that domain on subsequent visits. If a site doesn’t notice Chrome’s hidden Flash Player, and directs a user to adobe.com’s download page, Chrome will cancel that navigation and offer the user the option of activating the copy of Flash Player it keeps squirreled away for such occasions. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More To keep user prompts down to a dull roar, Google says it’ll temporarily exempt the ten sites generating the highest Flash usage. According to VentureBeat, that list starts with Google’s very own YouTube.com. The other nine top hotbeds of legacy Flash use: Facebook, Yahoo, VK.com, Live.com, Yandex.ru, OK.ru, Twitch.tv, Amazon, and Mail.ru. Google’s “allowlist” could change by the time its new policies kick in at year end. The writing’s already on the wall for Flash at some of those sites: last December, Facebook switched to HTML5 for most video content, and, in September, Amazon dumped Flash ads. Needless to say (though we’ll say it anyway), Flash-less mobile platforms like iOS and Google’s Android have contributed hugely to this transition. As VentureBeat reminds us, Google’s been gently easing Flash towards the exits for years. Even though YouTube still serves plenty of Flash content, Google moved to a HTML5 default in January 2015. The following month, it began automatically converting most Flash campaigns to HTML5, and next January it’ll stop running Flash display ads altogether. If you’re just awakening from a deep sleep, you might be wondering: Why all the Flash hate? Well, it’s really quite remarkable that Flash is still generating this many security flaws after all these years, but it does, practically like clockwork. Just last week, we reported Adobe’s release of a Flash update to patch yet another zero-day hole – along with no less than 25 bugs. Then, there was the zero-day flaw Adobe patched in April… and the really significant ones from March… and last July’s…  and this one… and this zero-day from last February, quickly exploited by poisoned ads. Need you keep putting yourself at risk by using Flash? As more and more sites and apps adopt HTML5, many users can shout NO to that question, too. So, as a public service, we share this compilation of uninstall instructions, courtesy of the folks at Occupy Flash.

The program rewarded Local Guides, those who help contribute to the Google Maps community, on a tier-based system. The more contributions you made, the more points you earned, and the higher your level would become. Local Guides are being alerted that Google is now cutting back on one of its most generous offers — a free terabyte of storage for two years after reaching level 4. The company is reducing that amount of storage to 100GB for people who reach level 4. According to this Google Help Center article, the decision was made as a result of the growth of the Local Guides community. With more people contributing to the program it makes sense that Google couldn’t keep with giving droves of people a free terabyte of storage. ”We are changing the Drive storage benefit for Level 4 from 1 TB to 100 GB, so that we can continue giving Drive storage to all Level 4 qualified Local Guides.” The good news is if you’re on the cusp of reaching level 4, you have until July 21st to level up and redeem your free 1TB of storage. Of course, if you have already reached level 4 or higher, Google will continue to honor your reward until its time runs out.

Mercedes-Benz, Chinese ride-service Didi Chuxing and others agreed to consider Udacity graduates for job openings.  The employer pool is growing quickly. Research firm and venture capital database CB Insights has identified 33 corporations working on autonomous cars, including auto makers GM and Volvo, internet giants Baidu and Google, and Silicon Valley companies tech firm Intel and startup ride-service Lyft.  GM for one is hiring dozens of engineers in the area, and Uber is looking to fill more than 50 positions in Pittsburgh, where the company is building a fleet of self-driving cars, according to jobs website Glassdoor.  "I love people with MIT and Stanford degrees," Thrun said. But "there are a lot of people who can't make it to those institutions. There are entire generations of people who are equally smart and equally capable."  Yet the idea that a certificate from an online training programme would secure a job in one of the most difficult emerging technologies strikes some recruiters as very unlikely.  A master's degree in computer science from a leading university such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Stanford University is the usual, and still preferred, course.  "You'd be hard-pressed to say the Udacity candidate is going to be more qualified because they have some specific knowledge about self-driving cars, versus someone who has a rock-hard degree in computer science or data science," said Dave Carvajal, chief executive of recruiting firm Dave Partners, which fills executive jobs at venture-backed tech companies.  Hungry for talent  With a scarcity of talent in the workforce, companies have been recruiting directly from universities with strong programs in data science, robotics and machine learning. Carnegie Mellon University suffered an exodus of staff last year after Uber hired away 40 faculty and researchers for its Advanced Technologies Centre.  Startups, too, are sparring to build autonomous vehicle staff. Varden Labs, a company of fewer than 15 people working on self-driving car technology, is "hiring aggressively" although the field is "very competitive," said co-founder Alex Rodrigues.  Technology companies frequently bemoan their struggle to hire qualified engineers, but the challenge is more pronounced in autonomous vehicles, which combines complex technologies such as machine learning and computer vision, and applies them to cars. Startups in particular are struggling to hire against powerhouses such as Apple Inc and Google, say recruiters.  "The startups will have to get by with one, two, three or four people who can do it," said Dan Portillo, talent partner at venture firm Greylock Partners.  But a small team may be enough for startup success. GM in March purchased Cruise Automation, a three-year-old autonomous vehicle startup with about 40 employees, for about US$1bil (RM4.13bil). Uber last month agreed to buy Otto, which is less than a year old, in a deal valued at US$680mil (RM2.81bil).  "Early hires are making unbelievable amounts of money in a few short years," Rodrigues said. — Reuters You May Be Interested Billionaire Ananda Krishnan exploring taking Astro private India bans Zakir Naik's NGO Maybank sells entire stake in Visa Inc for RM413mil Beware of Rove beetles Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Petronas’ net profit soars on lower impairment losses, other factors Malindo Air offering one million tickets to celebrate winning award Catch Doctor-X on the all-new dimsum.my! advertisement Latest News Rideshare service Lyft gets a flashy new look Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment Most Viewed in Tech Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Warning!
