The exploration app, which enables users to explore the planet thanks to satellite imagery captured by the technology giant has introduced several new features, including Voyager, a new series of guided tours of different parts of Earth. It includes input from BBC Earth as well as exclusive content from Planet Earth II, the BBC series presented and narrated by Sir David. The update has been made available for the Chrome web browser and Android versions of the app, and also includes improved and more detailed satellite imagery. Google Earth’s Gopal Shah said: “With the new Earth, we want to open up different lenses for you to see the world and learn a bit about how it all fits together; to open your mind with new stories while giving you a new perspective on the locations and experiences you cherish.

Zoom in and see what adventures await you in the new Google Earth.” A new 3D button has also been introduced to the app, which adds the ability to see any place on the map in 3D, a feature only previously available in specially designated locations. The ‘I’m feeling lucky’ button, which first appeared on Google’s search engine and carried out a random search for users has also been added to Earth, now automatically jumping to a random location and offering users information about it. View photos (Google)More “You might discover the lush green Pemba Island off the Swahili coast, the historic La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, or the Zao Hot Spring in Yamagata, Japan,” Shah said. “We’ve curated 20,000 different places, so roll the dice and see where the world takes you.” Google said the new version of the app will be made available for Apple iOS users “in the near future”.

Google partnered up with storytellers, scientists, and nonprofit organizations to develop Voyager, which currently has over 50 available online tours and Google promised to add more on a weekly basis. Google just launched its latest Google Earth feature called “Voyager.” Image credit: Google / Wired Voyager will give people the chance to explore sites they’ve heard of, as oppose to Google Earth’s previous features to see random places of the planet in the hopes of discovering something interesting. Google Earth’s Voyager has over 50 available trips Voyager features dozens of themed journeys across the globe, including “Museums around the world,” “Earth View,” and “Birds of Paradise.” Museums around the world is a tour that takes you to a Street View of 28 museums around the globe, including Museo Reina Sofia in Madrid and The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The Street View takes you to museums from every continent in the world, along with a brief description of the museum and photo. Earth View will allow people to see the most striking landscapes available on Google Earth. The feature even has a color palette, which sends you to a different location whenever you press a color. There’s an available option to download a wallpaper of the place visited and a Surprise Me mode that sends you to a random location. Beautiful Birds of Paradise voyage includes clips from “Planet Earth” narrated by Sir David Attenborough. Voyager features dozens of themed journeys across the globe. Image credit: Earth Blog “Colorful, extravagantly ornamented and extremely impressive, male birds of paradise develop amazing feathers and put on wonderful making displays,” says Attenborough in an opening video in Voyager’s Birds of paradise. “Found mostly in the island of New Guinea, they are among my favorites.” The tour features five different locations where different birds of paradise are found, along with a clip with a description of the beautiful birds narrated by Attenborough. The “National Treasures” tour journeys through six habitats from BBC Earth, showing the unique wildlife in different ecosystems such as islands, mountains, jungles, deserts, grasslands, and cities. Voyager even has a tour through Gombe National Park in Tanzania, to explore the location where Jane Goodall has spent most of her life conducting chimpanzee research. The tour discusses the chimpanzees and talks about conservation efforts. You can see pictures, and videos of the work Goodall has performed with the chimpanzees. If you’re planning to take a trip, Google Earth can now provide you with trip itineraries designed to show you all the best places to visit in cities like London, Tokyo, and Mexico City. Google Earth’s update also includes an “I’m lucky feature,” that when clicked on sends you to a random location or landmark along with descriptions of the site from Wikipedia. It has over 20,000 different locations which have been cured by the Google Earth team. Furthermore, another new feature from the latest update includes a 3D button that shows any place on the globe from any angle. Now, users can also share postcards of particular views from Google Earth. “When you find a view that leaves you breathless or inspires a fond memory, share a Postard of your exact view with your friends and family,” says Google Earth on the postcard latest feature. “They can click the link to jump right to where you were (virtually) standy.” Google Earth is now available for anyone accessing from a computer with Google Chrome, as before you could only see the sites through a downloaded version of the tool. Voyager will be available soon for other computer browsers. Google Earth is now available for anyone accessing from a computer with Google Chrome. Image credit: ConnectNigeria.com Google Earth has been criticized for invasion of privacy Google Earth is a virtual globe, mapped and equipped with geographical information, which was originally developed by Keyhole, Inc., a CIA-funded company that Google acquired in 2004. The product was called EarthViewer 3D and was re-released as Google Earth in 2005, according to Wikipedia. Several groups have criticized the platform for allegedly being an invasion of privacy and posing threats to national security. The platform had caused problems from governments around the world, such as the Israeli government, when Google Earth offered detailed images of classified areas in the country. Google Earth has been blocked by Google in Sudan and Iran since 2007 due to U.S.’ export restrictions. Many citizens around the world have expressed their worries regarding aerial images showing their properties and residences. In the United Kingdom, people also claim that Google Earth leads to vandalism of private ownership, as graffitis of genitals have been drawn on the roof of several locations by vandals in the hope of seeing their artwork on Google Earth.

Users can gain information about any location they are interested in as well as view 3D maps of certain popular locations. Under the new ‘Voyager’ segment, users can avail guided tours of specific locations while sitting at home. The tours are conducted by experts such as scientists and documentarians. Google Earth also comes with the ‘I’m Feeling Lucky’ tab that takes users to random locations. Each of the locations support knowledge cards that give little pointers of information about the place to the users. The ‘I’m Feeling Lucky’ tab does not take users to the well trodden paths but those locations which are relatively untouched by tourism. Each location is further supported by ‘points of interest’ which lets users explore other places around the spot that they are presently exploring. Google has completely revamped Google Earth and the new version retains almost nothing from the past. Right on opening Earth, users see a new layout with multiple icons. Each icon has a different function and will take the user on a different ‘tour’. The most interesting of the icons is the ship’s wheel, which launches ‘Voyager’ segment. Voyager is basically all about “stories” that give information about a region and its history, and is complete with 360 degree views. Google has partnered with third party sources for authenticity and to add interesting elements to their stories. Once a user embarks on a journey, the person can even send cards from the places they are at to family and friends. The e-postcard feature is restricted only to mobile for now, while desktop users get a traditional share link. There are over 50 stories in Voyager with Google expanding the list slowly. As a special Voyager feature, Google ‘This is Home’ takes users into homes across the world to explore different cultures and meet the people who live there. As the Google Earth Blog states, “Today we’re introducing a brand-new version of Google Earth – on the web and Android – two years in the making. With the new Earth, we want to open up different lenses for you to see the world and learn a bit about how it all fits together; to open your mind with new stories while giving you a new perspective on the locations and experiences you cherish. It’s everything you love about Google Earth, plus new ways for you to explore, learn and share.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Google Maps For iOS Brings ‘Your Timeline’, New iMessage App And ‘Directions’ Widget By Ali Salman 8 hours ago 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Google has rolled out an update for its Google Maps for iOS app the brings two major features to the table. The update integrates features well within the operating system that takes into account the new iMessage app and the ‘Directions’ widget. The update bumps up the version to 4.30.0 and includes forward facing features. Google is making its Maps app on iOS better to better compete against that of the stock Apple Maps on iOS. So let’s dive in and see what else does the update have in store for users. Google Maps For iOS Adds Directions Widget And An iMessage App For Location Sharing To begin with, Google Maps for iOS has been updated with a new Direction widget. This allows users to access their directions anywhere in the operating system from the Today View. While you had the option available to view your directions through in-app and via push notifications, it wasn’t easy to access. Now, with the new Directions widget, you even have the ability to access your location from the lock screen. You can so this by simply swiping left, and the today view will come into play housing the Directions widget. Related Facebook Messenger Is Getting An Apple Music And Spotify Extension The second major feature part of the update is the addition of the new iMessage app that allows users to share their location with contacts easily. The update comes a few days after the search engine giant released real-time location sharing in Google Maps. iMessage only supports static or still location sharing, instead of updating it consistently like on Android by Google Maps. Below is the complete change log for everything announced in the new update. What’s New in Version 4.30.0 Get turn-by-turn navigation right on your lock screen with the new Directions widget Use the new iMessage app to send your static location to contacts without leaving the conversation Bug fixes Related iWork, GarageBand, iMovie Apps Now Absolutely Free for All iOS & Mac Users – Download Links Advertisement Another new feature that Google announced in a blog post is ‘Your Timeline’. The feature keeps track of all the places that you have visited and can be accessed from the slide out menu in the Google Maps app for iOS. Google also emphasizes that the information in the Timeline interface can be edited easily, allowing you to change the names and address so everything is accurate. You can see your Timeline in a place-by-place method which will include the places you have visited, total distance traveled, the mean by which you traveled and more. Apart from this, users will also see visit information on the separate place cards of businesses and locations. This includes information of the visited place like the date, time and more. Google Maps on iOS is a neat addition for users as Apple Maps did not meet user requirement. Google has been constantly updating its Google Maps for iOS app to add more features and improve its performance. While the app now covers most of the important aspects of the operating system. This is it for now, folks. What are your thoughts on the new Google Maps for iOS update? Do you think the addition of a new Directions widget is worthwhile?

We can pick out images too obscure for Google's AI Google's Cloud Vision API getting stuff wrong once noise is added 19 Apr 2017 at 05:31, Simon Sharwood Google's Cloud Vision API is easily blinded by the addition of a little noise to the images it analyses, say a trio of researchers from the Network Security Lab at the University of Washington, Seattle. Authors Hossein Hosseini, Baicen Xiao and Radha Poovendran have hit arXiv with a pre-press paper titled Google’s Cloud Vision API Is Not Robust To Noise (PDF) that says “In essence, we found that by adding noise, we can always force the API to output wrong labels or to fail to detect any face or text within the image.” The authors explain that if one can add different types of noise to an image, the Cloud Vision API will always incorrectly analyse the pictures presented to it. The image at the top of this story (or here for m.reg readers) shows the false results the API returned. It doesn;t need to be a lot of noise: the authors found an average of 14.25 per cent "impulse noise" got the job done. At this point readers may ask why this matters: the authors suggest that deliberately adding noise to images could be an attack vector because “an adversary can easily bypass an image filtering system, by adding noise to an image with inappropriate content.” Which sounds interesting because bad actors could easily learn that images are subject to machine analysis. For example, The Register recently learned of a drone designed to photograph supermarket shelves so that image analysis can automatically figure out what stock needs to be re-ordered. An attack on such a trove of images that results in empty shelves could see customers decide to shop elsewhere. And let's not even start to think what would happen if photos of wanted criminals were corrupted so that known villains could walk in front of CCTV cameras with impunity. The researchers also strike a small blow for humanity, because they found images that fool Google remain easily-recognised by real, live, flesh-and-blood people.

It was less than a month ago that the firm resurrected its "Free App of the Week" section on the Play Store. Now, when checking the Play Store, it appears that the free section is no longer in existence. If you missed out on the promotion, Google was giving away one free app every week. When we last checked, Google was offering Card Wars - Adventure Time which is normally priced at $2.99. However, pulling the promotion doesn't come as a complete surprise, since we did speculate that it could be some kind of short-term test. The company had not officially unveiled details about the section. If looking for something similar, you might want to take a look at Amazon, as the company has been giving away one free app each day through its own app store for quite some time.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 19 April 2017 | MYT 1:10 PM PayPal and Google get cosy with new digital wallet partnership The Android Pay deal increases PayPal’s reach in stores, which Schulman sees as key to getting customers to use PayPal more frequently than the current average of two to three transactions per month. — AFP PayPal Holdings Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google deepened their relationship with a new agreement that enables payments through the tap of a phone from PayPal accounts at thousands of new retail locations.  The partnership lets PayPal users link their accounts to Android Pay, Google’s digital wallet, on smartphones running most versions of the Android operating system. This makes PayPal a funding option when people use Android Pay in locations including Walgreens Boots Alliance drug stores and Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants. PayPal was added as a payment method for Google's Play app and digital content store almost three years ago.  PayPal CEO Dan Schulman has been busy cutting deals with banks, credit card issuers and wireless carriers to convert PayPal from a payments button on websites into a versatile financial tool used to make payments in stores, transfer money overseas and shop from smartphones on the go.  The Android Pay deal increases PayPal’s reach in stores, which Schulman sees as key to getting customers to use PayPal more frequently than the current average of two to three transactions per month.  “This is the next logical step in our desire to partner with everyone in the ecosystem,” said Aunkur Arya, senior vice president at PayPal unit Braintree, which enabled the Android Pay tie-up. “These partnerships don’t happen unless there’s value for both sides.”  One big challenge remains: PayPal accounts can't link to Apple Inc’s digital wallet, Apple Pay.  The stronger relationship between Google and PayPal could rekindle speculation about an acquisition. PayPal split from parent company eBay Inc two years ago, prompting hope it could be a target of tech companies or financial institutions looking to enter the digital payments industry. PayPal processed US$354bil (RM1.56tril) in payments through 197 million active customers in 2016.  “The more closely they work together, the more potential there is for a future combination,” said Gil Luria, director of research at D.A. Davidson & Co. PayPal declined to comment on takeover talk, while a Google spokeswoman wasn't available to comment.  Shoppers accustomed to swiping credit cards have been slow to embrace digital wallets, which use technology called near-field communication to enable transactions between smartphones and retail payment terminals. The PayPal deal may boost Google’s mobile payments efforts, which have progressed in fits and starts.  The search giant’s Google Wallet failed to gain traction, and its Android Pay faces competition from Apple. Two years ago, Samsung Electronics Co, the largest Android phone maker, introduced its own payment system, Samsung Pay, for its devices. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested Germany’s VCs hunt for software startups as Berlin loses crown Hackers exploit Japan’s mobile gamers with fake fantasy cash The driverless future: Where is artificial intelligence taking us?

"I don't know why. I see many adult magazines on Play Store and App Store. It's interesting that on one hand Google Play Store is suspending the app and on the other some fans are 'complaining' that I am not even nude in the photos," Poonam said. She unveiled the app on Monday. She also tweeted: "Google has suspended the app but Android users can directly download #ThePoonamPandeyApp from my website." When IANS reached Google for a comment, Google spokesperson said: "We don't comment on individual applications. You can check out our policies for more information." Despite the "ban", Poonam seemed to be happy.

SD835, dual rear camera, steel body confirmed   Technology, In Other News There’s a new Google Earth on the web – it’s magical DECCAN CHRONICLE Published Apr 19, 2017, 9:39 am IST Updated Apr 19, 2017, 9:50 am IST Google’s attempt at revamping its long forgotten Google Earth strives to make it “the” destination for seeking virtual adventure.  Google earth gets many new features, Voyager being its highlight. Google has launched a new and revamped version of the Google Earth service. With the new update, the application wants to provide a medium for exploring the adventurous phenomenon of the blue planet. The new Google Earth is now a web-based service, i.e you no longer need to download a separate application on your computer. However, you need to get the application if you also want to explore other heavenly bodies, like Mars and Moon, apart from the Earth. You also need to download the app if you want to experience the new Google Earth on your Android phone – courtesy the high-quality graphics (nothing for iOS users as of now). Google has added many new features to the service. One of the highlighting new features is the Voyager section where Google has partnered with various groups like NASA, BBC and other wildlife conservation groups to provide a 360-degree live experience of that place. For instance, you can visit various preserved forest ranges that have been documented by BBC earth, through live 360-degree videos. There’s a new "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature takes you to a random location around the globe. Google Earth is also highlighting around 20,000 lesser-known destinations – the kinds of places locals might frequent or know about. Google also announced an update to a virtual-reality version of Google Earth. It now works with Facebook's Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive. However, it won't work with cheaper, phone-based VR systems, such as Google's Daydream and Samsung's Gear VR.

"This is our gift to the world," Google Earth director Rebecca Moore said while unveiling an early look at the new version of the program that lets people range the planet from the comfort of their computers, smartphones or tablets. "It's a product that speaks to our deepest values around education and making information available to people." A new 'Voyager' feature enables people digitally exploring the planet to be guided on interactive stories told by experts, boasting partners including BBC Earth, NASA, Sesame Street, and the Jane Goodall Institute. Google artificial intelligence will be put to work for Earth users in the form of "knowledge cards" that let them dive deeper into online information about mountains, countries, landmarks or other places being virtually visited. It will also make suggestions on other locations armchair explorers might be interested in exploring based on what they have searched in the past. "This is the first time we have done this deep integration with the Google Knowledge Graph," Earth engineering manager Sean Askay said. "Everything Google knows about the world, you can know about the world." There is also a newly installed "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature for people who want to let the software suggest hidden gems such as Pemba Island off the Swahili coast or the Oodaira Hot Spring in Yamagata, Japan. People can choose to fly around the world in Earth, using a 3-D button to see the Grand Canyon, Chateau Loire Valley and other stunning spots from any angles they wish. "With the new Earth, we want to open up different lenses for you to see the world and learn a bit about how it all fits together; to open your mind with new stories while giving you a new perspective on the locations and experiences you cherish," Earth product manager Gopal Shah said in a blog post. Online explorers cruising the mobile version of Earth can also capture pictures on their travels, sending friends digital postcards. New Earth was launched on Google's Chrome and Android software, with versions tailored for Apple devices and other internet browsing software promised soon. It's the first time that Earth can be reached on a web browser instead of through applications installed on devices. The move allows Google to tap into more powerful computing power at data centers in the internet "cloud" instead of relying on the capabilities of smartphones and other devices.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 83 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares164 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Nope. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ?

Google accidentally pushed a Dogfood test build of the May 2017 security update to the Pixel XL Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 4:20pm PDTApr 18, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 85 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Applications Google News Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart. Last month, the company pushed an unfinished Google Drive for Windows update, causing Drive to break for thousands of users. Now Google has accidentally released a confidential build of the May 2017 security update to normal Pixel XL owners. We've received a few reports of the update so far, and our own Artem has received the update on his Pixel XL as well. As you can see from the below screenshot, this was clearly not meant for public release:   There isn't any user-visible changes in this update, which has a build number of N2G470. One tipster said he received the new Play Store UI after updating, but that's likely just a server-side change that was flipped by coincidence. Let us know in the comments below if you see it on your phone. Thanks: Everyone who sent this in Tags dogfood Google N2G470 ota security update update subscribe ...

Suicide_Note But i like beta software. matteventu Considering there's people who has issues after updating to the STABLE April patch (fingerprint reader not working among all the others), I would strongly suggest you NOT to update to a dogfood build :D ZettabyteGamer Install Android O Tr3ple How stable is it so far? Don't wanna fuck up my pixel like I fucked up my 6p. Lol VAVAMk_2 How did you fuck up your 6P? ParanoidAirbag I got the new Play Store UI without getting this update for the record Suicide_Note Same here. Cleared the Play Store app cache this morning and it popped up for me. boop Most likely case is that he already had the UI but needed to reload the app and rebooting the device to update just happened to do that. Funem Same here on a Samsung S7. Its about time as well as some of the new feature were long overdue Marty Me too. Got it on my Honor 8, Xperia XP and some LineageOS devices. itsalaser Same here on my Nexus 4 Dmitry Stepanushkin Same on my Nexus 5. Seems to be enabled for most of devices on server side. Deeco What new UI? The new my apps page? EvilHowl I haven't :( Peter Please someone grab the OTA URL Brad Hoschar And post it to XDA Artem Russakovskii I looked through the logcat but didn't find it there. Peter It will be there, but often requires a Full Bug Report to get the entire logcat. George "Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart." AP throwing shade at Google... Lord Argyris Aren't they all effectively Dogfood builds these days? Marty Soon they revert to cat food builds...after the secondary process of the dog food builds happen. Pewww... JD The new internal builds are now dogshit builds taylor banasiak I'm in the process of downloading it. I'm happy. Tr3ple Uh lol EJ102D My Nexus 6 received the UI update for Google Play today actually... C Lo Dog food build? Isn't this the same build Google's been releasing? Wonder what this one breaks. Kay Hocking It's come up on mine - should we be downloading it?? Peter Please send yourself a bug report and grab the update URL from it. Kay Hocking I don't know how to do that! Peter Settings... About phone ... Tap lots of times on Build Number. This will enable Developer Options in main Settings menu. Bug Report option is in there. Do it, takes a few mins, then email it to yourself. Open it up and look for .zip in the .txt file. Or share it here and I'll dig thru it for ya. Scott I tried to share it but it seems they get removed or are moderated or something. goo . gl slash 4KudHG Peter Got it now. Thanks! JD Ok Google go home you're drunk whispy_snippet What is this amateur hour?! NinoBr0wn "Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart. Last month, the company pushed an unfinished Google Drive for Windows update, causing Drive to break for thousands of users." Edit: ..causing Drive to break for tens of users. Corbin Davenport Between all the posts on the Drive Product Forums, Twitter, Reddit, and other sites, there were definitely thousands (myself included). NinoBr0wn That comment definitely wasn't being facetious. But this one is. Trooper311 Nothing showed up for me on my PIxel Xl. I am sure they have fixed the issue by now. derk p :: checks software update:: Nothing showed up for me on my Pixel. I am sure they have fixed the issue by now. Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. Total Insecurity Google needs to bring their machine learning technology to the next step and help them to differ between testers and customers! mrjayviper doesn't seemed to be a problem with Apple and I doubt they use any AI (or at least to Google's level) on their OTA updates PhantomGamers He was joking... -.- Sir_Brizz No compromises device. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 stan gurule Same here on my HTC 10. Adam Margeson Same what? stan gurule Whatever dogfood update it was, everyone else was saying "same here" so I had too also. Wasn't serious though... 4Ui812 It wasn't an accident it's Google. They been fucking up a lot shit lately. JohnyNoLegs Prob shows that customers are getting beta/alpha/dogfood builds anyway. pks OTA link: https://ota.googlezip.net/packages/ota-api/google_marlin_marlin/6ea1ccda14a13cd03ab763d27fd7047025a53d3f.zip MrJakeK Next can we talk how horrible their beta forum is? Open non-private GooglePlus board where all the comments are random jerks asking for beta on their old broken phones? Google take notes from Motorola, you owned them for a second you should have learned. YuCMi I guess the idea of "being professional" is lost on Google. Karen Fennell I got this as well! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/329aa615888972a22bb6aed46e9dc9321d2ef29076d01d8cfa5c7cd3f0277b50.png Nathan J "Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart." They seem to be taking a page out of Bethesda's book. All of the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games released in the past 15 years have been buggy messes. And like Android, they are usually fixed by a dedicated community of developers. That settles it. Google needs to release Android for the Pip-boy. /s The limited edition Pip-boy can hold a phone, but I don't think any Android phones are small enough. Maybe, just maybe the Xperia Mini line. It seems to have been made with the iPhone 6 in mind. Sadly, it can't charge one and blocks the port. If someone could 3D print, paint, and polish up a good one, I can see an Android phone where the screen goes, a 10,000mAh power pack where the tape deck is, and wires on the inside connecting the two. The official Pip-boy design is too bulky for practicality, but a slimmer design meant for bigger phones, like the S8/+, G6, Pixel XL, iPhone Plus, etc., holding the phone at an angle over the arm, could be very cool. Especially with an interface geared toward one-handed, landscape use. Anonymous Vagrant What's the name of the download speed monitor app seen on the screenshots? iCoerce I have the new play store ui on both my 3T and S7. 3T running 7.1.2 and my S7 still only on 7.0, so that was definitely just a server side switch. jon Glad to know they do that. Jaufder in Granite Bay (Sac) My Pixel XL has gone absolutely batshit since the 7.1.2 upgrade I did last week. I had previously been dealing with battery problems noted on 7.1.1 ( which mysteriously resolved even before I upgraded to 7.1.2). Now, with 7.1.2, my phone app is locking up, audio is cutting out and/or making amazingly loud crackling noises, headphone audio stops working periodically, the phone randomly shuts off, phone calls won't hang up...etc, etc. It's barely useable at this point. Aufar Ramadhan My Nexus 6 running Android 7.1.1 is perfect! No downgrades, and no bugs! Gonna flash LineageOS before 2018. Sudev Seems they did it on purpose... They're showcasing that they are "internally testing" things before they release it to public. /s Teja Don't know why lately Google has been messing up things. Nexus 6P OTA with major issues causing rollback, Pixel 7.1.2 OTA having fingerprint issues and this one. P. Sherman Please remind me again on how Google is still "superior" to Samsung and OnePlus for pulling s--- like this. As if they weren't content enough on disabling fingerprint readers and borking Bluetooth connectivity... Sumeet Gandhi It updated the playstore for me on my Pixel XL. Now it looks pretty neat tough.

Name: Subject: Message: New Nat & Friends video explains how Google Earth actually works Newsby Brian Reigh1 hour ago The latest Nat & Friends video explores just how 3D images are created for Google Earth, but unfortunately, Lo will be officially leaving the project. See also: The new Google Earth adds random locations, interactive tours, and more 13 hours ago If you are curious about what goes on inside Google or if you just live on YouTube like me, you’ve probably heard a thing or two about Nat and Lo. Nat and Lo both work at Google, and since 2015, they’ve been making videos under what they call the 20% Project: at Google, employees are allowed to spend part of their time working on something that they came up with, and Nat and Lo decided to go behind the scenes of interesting projects at the company. Well, the latest video is all about Google Earth. As Nat explains, it was almost 50 years ago that we saw the first ever photo of the planet that we live in from the outer space. Today, we can access not only that but every nook and cranny of this amazing planet right on our computer, thanks to Google’s 3D images on Google Earth. Now, Google Earth is about to see some important changes, so it’s only fitting that we learn more about just how Google creates these breathtakingly accurate models of the world. To sum it up without spoiling the whole video for you, Google Earth actually relies on photos taken on a plane rather than satellite images. To sum it up without spoiling the whole video for you, Google Earth actually relies on photos taken on a plane rather than satellite images. Google employees fly an airplane and essentially go zig-zag over an area, through which various advanced sensors create overlapping images to capture the landscapes and create the clearest and the most accurate 3D model. If you want to find out more about this incredible process, you can watch the video above. As you may have noticed, the latest video is actually called Nat & Friends, not Nat & Lo. That’s because Lo will no longer be a co-host for the video series; however, she does make her first cameo in this episode. What do you think? It’s pretty cool how Google Earth creates its 3D models, eh?

This follows a recommendation from the Watal Committee report on digital payments, which explicitly said that direct carrier billing is not permitted under current regulations, but that the RBI, TRAI and the DoT should allow Direct Carrier Billing. The good news first: The most significant development in this announcement is that now prepaid users can purchase apps and services using their mobile balance. Remember that though direct carrier billing had been launched earlier last year (with a deal between Idea and Google), it had subsequently been limited, via a direction from the Department of Telecom (we were told by sources), only to postpaid consumers. Google subsequently also launched carrier billing for the Play Store with Airtel, with the same limitation. Over 95% of India’s user base is prepaid: the first put money into their mobile account, and then use it for purchases. This development will allow apps creators to target more than just the 1%. The terrible news: The Department of Telecom has also said that “Such purchase of digital content shall not be treated as pass-through revenue for the purpose of computing Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) for license fee and spectrum usage charge.” Advertisement Now, this is myopic and creates a massive disincentive for carrier billing. One key reason why content creators did not want to integrate carrier billing was the additional charges that were levied on the content. Because the government taxed telecom operator revenue for license fee and “spectrum usage charge” (together called WPC charges). The Indian government takes a certain percentage (around 8-10%) of a telecom operator revenue as Adjusted Gross Revenue. Historically, these charges amounted to 12-13% in total. On top of that, telecom operators would keep their own revenue share, the aggregator (like Google Play Store would keep theirs, and the remainder would go to the content creator. In 2014, Vodafone was giving 60-70% of money to the aggregator, post taxes. To simplify (and do correct me if I’m wrong about this): Historically, with WPC Charges, for every Rs 100 that was spent on Mobile VAS, in a best case scenario: For every Rs 100, the government gets Rs 13. Rest get Rs 83. From the Rs 83, the telecom operator keeps Rs 24.9 (30%). Rest get Rs 58.1. From the Rs 58.1, the aggregator keeps Rs 17.43 (30%). Content provider gets Rs 40.67 In a worst case scenario: For every Rs 100, the government gets Rs 13. Rest get Rs 83. From the Rs 83, the telecom operator keeps Rs 58.1 (70%). Rest get Rs 24.9. From the Rs 24.9, the aggregator keeps Rs 7.47 (30%). Content provider gets Rs 17.43 Of course, revenue shares may vary, but this indicates how for content providers, much of the revenue gets lost in transmission. What Google and Idea had done was a best case scenario. For an app that cost Rs 100 For every Rs 100, government got Rs 0, since this was treated as pass-through-revenue For Rs 100, Idea levied a 16% convenience fee. Rest got Rs 84 On the Rs 84, Google took 30% as app store (aggregator) charges. Developer got Rs 58.8 From what we heard, the structure varied by circle, but that is unconfirmed. Still, it is a better deal than what happens when there are WPC charges. Pass through revenue or not Our recommendation, in 2014, was: 1. Take carrier billing out of the mandate of telecom license fees, and treat them as pass-through revenue 2. Kill the revenue share, enforce a transaction fee 3. Enforce verification of billing (to prevent fraud, which was/is rife in case of mobile VAS) The argument against here is that purchasing an app or a video online isn’t utilization of spectrum: consumption of data is. So while the government should get a revenue share for usage of data, it shouldn’t be applicable to the act of paying for something. This can actually be contested in court, but I doubt that will happen: telecom operators don’t really care that much about carrier billing; they have other battles to fight in court. What can happen next It’s not likely that the telecom operators and the Google Play Store will shut down direct carrier billing just because WPC charges are applicable. What they can do, is change the way they are working together. It’s a little complicated, but here goes: Recharges go to wallets, not prepaid account: Airtel, Idea, Vodafone, Reliance Jio together account for most of India’s mobile and Internet users. All of them have licenses for wallets, and wallets can do auto recharge. What telecom operators can do is ensure that any prepaid recharge goes straight to a wallet account, and this money is available for payments, and for topping up recharges of the prepaid mobile account. Play Store junks carrier billing, and switches to wallet payments: tie up with multiple wallet services, including all the telecom operator wallets. At present, the Google Play Store has no wallet partnerships. The only question that remains: is it worth it? For direct carrier billing aggregators, like Fortumo, Boku and ipayy, this is option isn’t available, so WPC charges will remain.

It has become big enough to draw a competitive response from giants like Microsoft, but not big enough to have the roster of large corporate clients that it needs to compete with the giants. SAN FRANCISCO >> Slack is the classic Silicon Valley accidental success. Born three years ago, with roots in a failed video game, the messaging software is now used by 5 million people. The company behind it, Slack Technologies, found success by combining something that Silicon Valley fetishizes — rich data on how people use a product — with something it often overlooks: How do people actually feel while using it? This combination produced an unlikely hit that, when it became available in 2014, grew mostly by word-of-mouth, which is unusual for corporate software. Last year, the privately held company was valued at nearly $4 billion. Now Slack faces a significant new challenge. It has become big enough to draw a competitive response from giants like Microsoft, but not big enough to have the roster of large corporate clients that it needs to compete with the giants. Last fall, Microsoft announced a direct Slack rival called Teams, to be given free to all 85 million users of its Office 365. At the same time, Facebook made its work collaboration tool, Workplace, widely available free. Atlassian, a smaller company, has signed big customers, too. As a result, Slack, which built up momentum as a lovable underdog, must fend off some of technology’s largest and fiercest competitors if it wants to be more than a niche tool for small businesses and teams. Microsoft, for instance, already offers ways for employees to collaborate. And while its offerings have not been viral hits, they have offered boring but important features that big companies demand, like strong data security and regulatory compliance controls. There is no illusion within Slack that success is certain. But Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive, said small tech companies with new ideas had long defeated larger rivals that tried to copy them. Think of Apple’s beating IBM in personal computing, Google’s beating Microsoft in search and Facebook’s crushing Google in social networks. One advantage Slack does have is focus, Butterfield maintains. Microsoft, for example, has numerous Slack-like products including Yammer, SharePoint, Skype for Business and now Teams. The executives who run those businesses within Microsoft must “compete for budget and mind share and attention,” he said, providing an opening for Slack to gain users while Microsoft managers wage internal wars. Microsoft said users would embrace Teams because it had strong encryption and global support and worked seamlessly with software they already used, like Excel. “We think customers value coherence,” said Bryan Goode, general manager of Office 365 at Microsoft. BORN FROM GAMES Slack is the product of Butterfield’s second failed attempt to make a video game. His first, called Game Neverending, had a photo-sharing feature that became more popular than the game. It became Flickr, which was sold to Yahoo for $25 million in 2005. In 2011, he introduced another game, Glitch, in which people cooperated to build a shared world. (Misbehaving players got a timeout.) At its height, the game was costing the company $500,000 a month and bringing in $30,000, so Butterfield shuttered it in late 2012. A few employees stayed on to build out the messaging platform that Glitch engineers had used to talk among themselves. That project became Slack. Slack was officially introduced in February 2014 and today has 5 million daily users, up from 4 million in October. Most users are on a free version, but about 1.5 million pay Slack $8 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search. The 750-person company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but it is not profitable. Initially popular with small teams of software engineers who wanted to work remotely without cumbersome videoconferences or email, Slack was not designed for big companies. Users chat in “channels,” typically organized around a few well-defined tasks. “The overhead of working among different offices becomes less of an issue” with Slack, said Nick Coronges, chief technology officer at R/GA, a 1,000-person design and marketing agency with offices in several cities. Collaboration software like Slack is not new. Google’s Wave, which started in 2009 and shut down in 2012, was supposed to replace email with a messaging tool, but conversations were too hard to follow and track. Atlassian, an Australian software company, released a team collaboration platform in 2004 and acquired Slack’s nearest startup rival, HipChat, in 2012. But Slack has focused on making a product that people love, a strategy that is more common among consumer companies like Apple, Snap and Spotify. Slack modeled itself after consumer messaging apps that let users communicate with GIFs, stickers and emojis. One Slack emoji is a cartoon raccoon with its palms pressed in respectful greeting. Called “raccooning,” it signifies, “Please take this conversation someplace else. You are getting off topic.” In Slack’s office in Vancouver, British Columbia, designers think about things like color choice, layout and Slack’s sign-in greeting, and how they might affect a customer’s peace of mind. Back at San Francisco headquarters, data jockeys pore over the kinds of signals that tech companies normally study, like time spent with the product and whether moving a button elicits a change in behavior. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” Slack wrote in an open letter to Microsoft that ran as a full-page ad in November in The New York Times. Unlike some Silicon Valley companies, Slack believes humans are as important as robots. All executives, including Butterfield, are expected to field the 6,000 customer support calls and 2,800 Twitter messages that come in each week. The average turnaround time for a help request is under an hour. “I get worried if I see customer satisfaction scores dip below 97 percent,” said Ali Rayl, Slack’s head of customer experience. If Slack can dovetail seamlessly with how people behave, feel like second nature to use and strongly appeal to employees, taking it away could become “like taking off your astronaut helmet in space,” Butterfield said. PURSUING LARGE CUSTOMERS When it began, Slack had fewer features than its rivals had, but that wasn’t seen as a problem at first. Tens of thousands of small teams were creating accounts, some even paying for them, without much prompting. Smaller customers still account for more than 50 percent of Slack’s revenue. But Slack knew it would always be a niche product without basic features like “threading,” a standard email and chat room feature that groups together replies to a message, and an easier sign-in process. Originally each team required its own sign-in, even if an employee worked on many teams in the same organization. As competition heated up, Slack started to elicit feedback from companies like Capital One. The bank’s teams wanted to log in at one place and get access to all of their Slack rooms. They wanted each channel to allow more people, and they wanted to customize features, like file sharing, to comply with regulations. Slack made those changes, and employees “latched on,” said Jennifer Manry, vice president for workforce technology at Capital One, “an indication that it was filling a critical need.” At the end of January, Butterfield unveiled Enterprise Grid. Aimed at companies and governments, it can manage the conversations of up to 500,000 employees at once. IBM, Jet.com, NASA and Home Depot are all customers. But Slack has not taken over. Capital One still uses collaboration tools from Microsoft and Atlassian. Facebook and smaller companies like Asana share customers with Slack, too. Slack is available only in English in the United States and Britain. Microsoft Teams is available in 181 markets around the world in 19 languages. BIG AMBITIONS The battle between Slack and its competitors is essentially a fight over who will make the next piece of workplace software that no one can live without. Many businesses, large and small, depend on Excel from Microsoft, Photoshop from Adobe and Gmail from Google. Slack wants to be in that pantheon — as the place where people collaborate and hang out online, the world’s virtual conference room and water cooler. Slack’s name — an acronym for Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge — underscores its big ambition. But to become a Microsoft-size success it needs workers to choose Slack over its competitors. “Companies want their employees to collaborate more, because better collaboration reduces the need to jump ship,” said Sean Ryan, head of partnerships at Facebook Workplace. “The No. 1 reason people leave their jobs is they feel isolated.” “We’re trying to build empathy at scale,” Butterfield said. Slack’s office walls are covered with customer feedback, and soothing French pop music is piped into the restrooms. Company engineers say being a good designer is like being a good host, and they use shorthand like “set out the towels” as they create new user features. “I’ve been building software for 15 years, and I’ve become more attuned to how the average person will interact with and experience software in the last 18 months here than in the prior 13 years,” said April Underwood, who joined Slack as vice president of product in 2015. Whether this approach translates into profits for Slack depends largely on how fast the company can expand into more countries and whether employees at big companies push their information technology departments to pay for it. That would necessitate an unusual level of devotion to a piece of workplace software, which is why Slack says it is so devoted to its users’ well-being. “There are people who will die, get divorced, have children with cancer,” Butterfield said. “You really have to put yourself in their frames of mind. If we preoccupy these people for a minute longer than we have to, we’ll lose them.” Get the latest news by email Sign Up Share this: PREV NEXT Most Read Bank of Hawaii removing its ATMs from McDonald’s The word on the streets is that they are horrible Former Hawaii sumotori Musashimaru and Akebono hospitalized in Japan Lawyer helped UH-Hilo with telescope Police: Man kills 3 on Fresno street, says he ‘hates white people’ Comments () By participating in online discussions you acknowledge that you have agreed to the TERMS OF SERVICE.

Google accidentally pushed a Dogfood test build of the May 2017 security update to the Pixel XL Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 4:20pm PDTApr 18, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 85 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Applications Google News Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart. Last month, the company pushed an unfinished Google Drive for Windows update, causing Drive to break for thousands of users. Now Google has accidentally released a confidential build of the May 2017 security update to normal Pixel XL owners. We've received a few reports of the update so far, and our own Artem has received the update on his Pixel XL as well. As you can see from the below screenshot, this was clearly not meant for public release:   There isn't any user-visible changes in this update, which has a build number of N2G470. One tipster said he received the new Play Store UI after updating, but that's likely just a server-side change that was flipped by coincidence. Let us know in the comments below if you see it on your phone. Thanks: Everyone who sent this in Tags dogfood Google N2G470 ota security update update subscribe ...

ParanoidAirbag I got the new Play Store UI without getting this update for the record Suicide_Note Same here. Cleared the Play Store app cache this morning and it popped up for me. boop Most likely case is that he already had the UI but needed to reload the app and rebooting the device to update just happened to do that.

Got it on my Honor 8, Xperia XP and some LineageOS devices. itsalaser Same here on my Nexus 4 Dmitry Stepanushkin Same on my Nexus 5. Seems to be enabled for most of devices on server side.

Last month, the company pushed an unfinished Google Drive for Windows update, causing Drive to break for thousands of users." Edit: ..causing Drive to break for tens of users. Corbin Davenport Between all the posts on the Drive Product Forums, Twitter, Reddit, and other sites, there were definitely thousands (myself included). NinoBr0wn That comment definitely wasn't being facetious. But this one is. Trooper311 Nothing showed up for me on my PIxel Xl. I am sure they have fixed the issue by now. derk p :: checks software update:: Nothing showed up for me on my Pixel. I am sure they have fixed the issue by now. Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. Total Insecurity Google needs to bring their machine learning technology to the next step and help them to differ between testers and customers! mrjayviper doesn't seemed to be a problem with Apple and I doubt they use any AI (or at least to Google's level) on their OTA updates PhantomGamers He was joking... -.- Sir_Brizz No compromises device. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 stan gurule Same here on my HTC 10. Adam Margeson Same what? stan gurule Whatever dogfood update it was, everyone else was saying "same here" so I had too also. Wasn't serious though... 4Ui812 It wasn't an accident it's Google. They been fucking up a lot shit lately. JohnyNoLegs Prob shows that customers are getting beta/alpha/dogfood builds anyway. pks OTA link: https://ota.googlezip.net/packages/ota-api/google_marlin_marlin/6ea1ccda14a13cd03ab763d27fd7047025a53d3f.zip MrJakeK Next can we talk how horrible their beta forum is? Open non-private GooglePlus board where all the comments are random jerks asking for beta on their old broken phones? Google take notes from Motorola, you owned them for a second you should have learned. YuCMi I guess the idea of "being professional" is lost on Google. Karen Fennell I got this as well! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/329aa615888972a22bb6aed46e9dc9321d2ef29076d01d8cfa5c7cd3f0277b50.png Nathan J "Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart." They seem to be taking a page out of Bethesda's book. All of the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games released in the past 15 years have been buggy messes. And like Android, they are usually fixed by a dedicated community of developers. That settles it. Google needs to release Android for the Pip-boy. /s The limited edition Pip-boy can hold a phone, but I don't think any Android phones are small enough. Maybe, just maybe the Xperia Mini line. It seems to have been made with the iPhone 6 in mind. Sadly, it can't charge one and blocks the port. If someone could 3D print, paint, and polish up a good one, I can see an Android phone where the screen goes, a 10,000mAh power pack where the tape deck is, and wires on the inside connecting the two. The official Pip-boy design is too bulky for practicality, but a slimmer design meant for bigger phones, like the S8/+, G6, Pixel XL, iPhone Plus, etc., holding the phone at an angle over the arm, could be very cool. Especially with an interface geared toward one-handed, landscape use. Anonymous Vagrant What's the name of the download speed monitor app seen on the screenshots? iCoerce I have the new play store ui on both my 3T and S7. 3T running 7.1.2 and my S7 still only on 7.0, so that was definitely just a server side switch. jon Glad to know they do that. Jaufder in Granite Bay (Sac) My Pixel XL has gone absolutely batshit since the 7.1.2 upgrade I did last week. I had previously been dealing with battery problems noted on 7.1.1 ( which mysteriously resolved even before I upgraded to 7.1.2). Now, with 7.1.2, my phone app is locking up, audio is cutting out and/or making amazingly loud crackling noises, headphone audio stops working periodically, the phone randomly shuts off, phone calls won't hang up...etc, etc. It's barely useable at this point. Aufar Ramadhan My Nexus 6 running Android 7.1.1 is perfect! No downgrades, and no bugs! Gonna flash LineageOS before 2018. Sudev Seems they did it on purpose... They're showcasing that they are "internally testing" things before they release it to public. /s Teja Don't know why lately Google has been messing up things. Nexus 6P OTA with major issues causing rollback, Pixel 7.1.2 OTA having fingerprint issues and this one. P. Sherman Please remind me again on how Google is still "superior" to Samsung and OnePlus for pulling s--- like this. As if they weren't content enough on disabling fingerprint readers and borking Bluetooth connectivity... Sumeet Gandhi It updated the playstore for me on my Pixel XL. Now it looks pretty neat tough.

Google Assistant adds support for Lowes Iris, Lutron Caseta, and Osram Lightify Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 3:41pm PDTApr 18, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 11 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares66 Google News Even if you have a wide array of smart home products from different manufacturers, Google wants to make sure they all work seamlessly on Assistant (and thus, the Google Home). The company has gradually added more supported services since launch, and now Assistant works with Lowes Iris, Lutron Caseta, and Osram Lightify. I've never heard of any of these products before, and maybe you haven't either, so I'll go over what these actually are. Lowes Iris is the store's smart home lineup, comprised of light bulbs, outlets, locks, and thermostats. Iris is already compatible with Amazon Alexa, so it's nice to see some support for the Google Home as well. Next up is Lutron Caseta Wireless, which includes dimmers, remote control shades, and a thermostat. Finally, Osram's Lightify product line includes smart LED lamps and light bulbs. If you have any of these devices, you can now connect them to Assistant through the Google Home app. Source: Google Home Help Tags google assistant google home lowe's lowes iris lutron lutron caseta osram osram lightify smart bulb smart home smart lock smart outlet subscribe ...

I want to see more aggressive IoT support from the Googs. A little piglet dies every time I have to concede the Amazon Echo has more IoT support than Google Home. Even though I think the Home is a better product in general. dcdttu You might mention that most if not all of those devices require a hub to work with Google Assistant. Individual items such as a Litton Caseta light switch won't simply work with Google Home. DarenTx I want Hulu support. Alfred Ridiculous. So my Google Home can turn off the lamp for me, but it still can't even play an mp3 I have on my phone or my PC. David Hyman Try all cast or es file Explorers Chromecast player. Both of those options work great for me when I want to cast something. All cast in particular works quite well mlm5em If the song is uploaded to Google play music, can it play from there? Or do you have to actually pay for the GPM subscription plan? (I pay for GPM so I can't test this). surethom If you ask for a song by artist & song title Google home will not play buy assistant on all other android devices will???

Google accidentally pushed a Dogfood test build of the May 2017 security update to the Pixel XL Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 4:20pm PDTApr 18, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 85 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Applications Google News Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart. Last month, the company pushed an unfinished Google Drive for Windows update, causing Drive to break for thousands of users. Now Google has accidentally released a confidential build of the May 2017 security update to normal Pixel XL owners. We've received a few reports of the update so far, and our own Artem has received the update on his Pixel XL as well. As you can see from the below screenshot, this was clearly not meant for public release:   There isn't any user-visible changes in this update, which has a build number of N2G470. One tipster said he received the new Play Store UI after updating, but that's likely just a server-side change that was flipped by coincidence. Let us know in the comments below if you see it on your phone. Thanks: Everyone who sent this in Tags dogfood Google N2G470 ota security update update subscribe ...

Suicide_Note But i like beta software. matteventu Considering there's people who has issues after updating to the STABLE April patch (fingerprint reader not working among all the others), I would strongly suggest you NOT to update to a dogfood build :D ZettabyteGamer Install Android O Tr3ple How stable is it so far? Don't wanna fuck up my pixel like I fucked up my 6p. Lol VAVAMk_2 How did you fuck up your 6P? ParanoidAirbag I got the new Play Store UI without getting this update for the record Suicide_Note Same here. Cleared the Play Store app cache this morning and it popped up for me. boop Most likely case is that he already had the UI but needed to reload the app and rebooting the device to update just happened to do that. Funem Same here on a Samsung S7. Its about time as well as some of the new feature were long overdue Marty Me too. Got it on my Honor 8, Xperia XP and some LineageOS devices. itsalaser Same here on my Nexus 4 Dmitry Stepanushkin Same on my Nexus 5. Seems to be enabled for most of devices on server side. Deeco What new UI? The new my apps page? EvilHowl I haven't :( Peter Please someone grab the OTA URL Brad Hoschar And post it to XDA Artem Russakovskii I looked through the logcat but didn't find it there. Peter It will be there, but often requires a Full Bug Report to get the entire logcat. George "Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart." AP throwing shade at Google... Lord Argyris Aren't they all effectively Dogfood builds these days? Marty Soon they revert to cat food builds...after the secondary process of the dog food builds happen. Pewww... JD The new internal builds are now dogshit builds taylor banasiak I'm in the process of downloading it. I'm happy. Tr3ple Uh lol EJ102D My Nexus 6 received the UI update for Google Play today actually... C Lo Dog food build? Isn't this the same build Google's been releasing? Wonder what this one breaks. Kay Hocking It's come up on mine - should we be downloading it?? Peter Please send yourself a bug report and grab the update URL from it. Kay Hocking I don't know how to do that! Peter Settings... About phone ... Tap lots of times on Build Number. This will enable Developer Options in main Settings menu. Bug Report option is in there. Do it, takes a few mins, then email it to yourself. Open it up and look for .zip in the .txt file. Or share it here and I'll dig thru it for ya. Scott I tried to share it but it seems they get removed or are moderated or something. goo . gl slash 4KudHG Peter Got it now. Thanks! JD Ok Google go home you're drunk whispy_snippet What is this amateur hour?! NinoBr0wn "Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart. Last month, the company pushed an unfinished Google Drive for Windows update, causing Drive to break for thousands of users." Edit: ..causing Drive to break for tens of users. Corbin Davenport Between all the posts on the Drive Product Forums, Twitter, Reddit, and other sites, there were definitely thousands (myself included). NinoBr0wn That comment definitely wasn't being facetious. But this one is. Trooper311 Nothing showed up for me on my PIxel Xl. I am sure they have fixed the issue by now. derk p :: checks software update:: Nothing showed up for me on my Pixel. I am sure they have fixed the issue by now. Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. Total Insecurity Google needs to bring their machine learning technology to the next step and help them to differ between testers and customers! mrjayviper doesn't seemed to be a problem with Apple and I doubt they use any AI (or at least to Google's level) on their OTA updates PhantomGamers He was joking... -.- Sir_Brizz No compromises device. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 stan gurule Same here on my HTC 10. Adam Margeson Same what? stan gurule Whatever dogfood update it was, everyone else was saying "same here" so I had too also. Wasn't serious though... 4Ui812 It wasn't an accident it's Google. They been fucking up a lot shit lately. JohnyNoLegs Prob shows that customers are getting beta/alpha/dogfood builds anyway. pks OTA link: https://ota.googlezip.net/packages/ota-api/google_marlin_marlin/6ea1ccda14a13cd03ab763d27fd7047025a53d3f.zip MrJakeK Next can we talk how horrible their beta forum is? Open non-private GooglePlus board where all the comments are random jerks asking for beta on their old broken phones? Google take notes from Motorola, you owned them for a second you should have learned. YuCMi I guess the idea of "being professional" is lost on Google. Karen Fennell I got this as well! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/329aa615888972a22bb6aed46e9dc9321d2ef29076d01d8cfa5c7cd3f0277b50.png Nathan J "Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart." They seem to be taking a page out of Bethesda's book. All of the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games released in the past 15 years have been buggy messes. And like Android, they are usually fixed by a dedicated community of developers. That settles it. Google needs to release Android for the Pip-boy. /s The limited edition Pip-boy can hold a phone, but I don't think any Android phones are small enough. Maybe, just maybe the Xperia Mini line. It seems to have been made with the iPhone 6 in mind. Sadly, it can't charge one and blocks the port. If someone could 3D print, paint, and polish up a good one, I can see an Android phone where the screen goes, a 10,000mAh power pack where the tape deck is, and wires on the inside connecting the two. The official Pip-boy design is too bulky for practicality, but a slimmer design meant for bigger phones, like the S8/+, G6, Pixel XL, iPhone Plus, etc., holding the phone at an angle over the arm, could be very cool. Especially with an interface geared toward one-handed, landscape use. Anonymous Vagrant What's the name of the download speed monitor app seen on the screenshots? iCoerce I have the new play store ui on both my 3T and S7. 3T running 7.1.2 and my S7 still only on 7.0, so that was definitely just a server side switch. jon Glad to know they do that. Jaufder in Granite Bay (Sac) My Pixel XL has gone absolutely batshit since the 7.1.2 upgrade I did last week. I had previously been dealing with battery problems noted on 7.1.1 ( which mysteriously resolved even before I upgraded to 7.1.2). Now, with 7.1.2, my phone app is locking up, audio is cutting out and/or making amazingly loud crackling noises, headphone audio stops working periodically, the phone randomly shuts off, phone calls won't hang up...etc, etc. It's barely useable at this point. Aufar Ramadhan My Nexus 6 running Android 7.1.1 is perfect! No downgrades, and no bugs! Gonna flash LineageOS before 2018. Sudev Seems they did it on purpose... They're showcasing that they are "internally testing" things before they release it to public. /s Teja Don't know why lately Google has been messing up things. Nexus 6P OTA with major issues causing rollback, Pixel 7.1.2 OTA having fingerprint issues and this one. P. Sherman Please remind me again on how Google is still "superior" to Samsung and OnePlus for pulling s--- like this. As if they weren't content enough on disabling fingerprint readers and borking Bluetooth connectivity... Sumeet Gandhi It updated the playstore for me on my Pixel XL. Now it looks pretty neat tough.

Pierce, the owner of a digital agency based in Jakarta, Indonesia, has voiced his opinion on the world of operating an SEO company. “This is an emerging field. Of course it’s not easy by any stretch of imagination. The competition is difficult and unforgiving. All I can do right now is thank the wonderful team that I have.

We provide quality control for various companies and their websites. Some of them are top ranked on Google searches”, stated a representative.

"This is our gift to the world," Google Earth director Rebecca Moore said while giving AFP an early look at the new version of the program that lets people range the planet from the comfort of their computers, smartphones or tablets. "It's a product that speaks to our deepest values around education and making information available to people." A new 'Voyager' feature enables people digitally exploring the planet to be guided on interactive stories told by experts, boasting partners including BBC Earth, NASA, Sesame Street, and the Jane Goodall Institute. Google artificial intelligence will be put to work for Earth users in the form of "knowledge cards" that let them dive deeper into online information about mountains, countries, landmarks or other places being virtually visited. It will also make suggestions on other locations armchair explorers might be interested in based on what they have searched in the past. "This is the first time we have done this deep integration with the Google Knowledge Graph," Earth engineering manager Sean Askay said. "Everything Google knows about the world, you can know about the world." There is also a newly installed "Feeling Lucky?" feature for people who want to let the software suggest hidden gems such as Pemba Island off the Swahili coast or the Oodaira Hot Spring in Yamagata, Japan. People can choose to fly around the world in Earth, using a 3-D button to see the Grand Canyon, chateaux of the Loire Valley and other stunning spots from any angles they wish. "Because we're doing a lot of the computing in the cloud, it allows you to have Google Earth right on your phone, so you can literally carry the whole world in your pocket," Earth product manager Gopal Shah told AFP at the New York launch. "The new version of Google Earth is really about education, it's really about immersing yourself in places you haven't been before to get a little bit of an exposure," he added. Online explorers cruising the mobile version of Earth can also capture pictures on their travels, sending friends digital postcards. New Earth was launched on Google's Chrome and Android software, with versions tailored for Apple devices and other internet browsing software promised soon. It's the first time that Earth can be reached on a web browser instead of through applications installed on devices. The move allows Google to tap into more powerful computing power at data centers in the internet "cloud" instead of relying on the capabilities of smartphones and other devices.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Explore the planet with Google Earth VR, now on… Explore the planet with Google Earth VR, now on Oculus Rift By Julian Chokkattu — April 18, 2017 8:18 PM Subscribe Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Thanks to Google, you can spend Earth Day in 2017 by flying around the planet — in virtual reality. Google Earth got a massive revamp today, but the search giant also brought its Google Earth VR app to the Oculus store. The experience has been available for the HTC Vive since the end of 2016, and bringing it to the Oculus Rift means a wider audience. We got a chance to travel to various countries in VR with the Rift at a Google event in New York City. Suffice to say it’s an experience that will have you coming back for more. “It’s an experience that will have you coming back for more. The Oculus version of the Earth VR app works just like the Vive experience, except you’ll be using Facebook’s new Touch controllers. You start out in space, but you can use the the analog stick on the right-hand controller to zoom in to anywhere on Earth; the secondary index trigger lets you rotate the camera horizontally. You don’t have to stick to a bird’s eye view either as there’s a 3D view that lets you look at stunningly-detailed content. Google said Maps is powered with satellite imagery as well as aerial photography — the latter often looks better and is prevalent in featured places, like Florence, Italy. Colombo, Sri Lanka only used satellite imagery, and while it still looked great, it wasn’t as impressive. Speaking of featured content — pressing the Y button on the left-hand controller opens up menu overlay, which lets you scroll through featured places to visit. You can also browse through some cinematic Tours of select areas here, and these are gorgeous shots mixed with heart-warming music that may or may not make your eyes well up. If you’re planning a trip and are scoping out things to see, what’s neat is you can save locations by holding the X button. But the killer feature in Google Earth VR is the god-like ability to control the sun. Find the source of light, click and drag it past the horizon to mask the world in darkness — and you’ll then see a brilliant sky lit up with the Milky Way. It’s a jaw-dropping moment, and we can’t see it ever getting old. If you have an Oculus Rift, you can check out the new free experience at the Oculus store now. Again, it’s been available for Vive users for some time now, but you can grab it here if you haven’t checked it out yet. Is it worth buying a VR-ready PC and VR headset for Google Earth VR? Maybe not, but it’s a must-try experience if you have one lying around. We’re hoping Google brings it to more accessible VR platforms like Daydream and Samsung’s Gear VR.

With a Google executive confirming that the second-generation flagship mobile devices would see a debut later this year, the release of the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL is all but certain. While the rumored release date of the upcoming devices has largely pleased fans, a particular feature rumored for the smartphones has been notably panned by fans of Google’s homegrown smartphones. Rumors about the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL have already begun to trickle down in a steady stream, with features and specs of the devices being teased in leaks and reports. The smartphones’ release date is among the most notable points of interest for those looking forward to the debut of the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. While the tech giant has announced no specific date, rumors are currently high that the Google Pixel 2 would be launched sometime around October, exactly one year since the first-generation flagships were unveiled to the public. #GooglePixel2 e le ultime informazioni emerse online https://t.co/uoLUSgM8cj pic.twitter.com/weNc7qg18p — Lorenzo Spada (@oznerol93) March 21, 2017 An October release date for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL is indeed highly likely, considering that Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice president of hardware, stated that the tech giant is looking to follow an annual release cycle for the premium-grade devices. This means that before the end of the year, Google’s flagship smartphones would definitely see a refresh. The specifications of the device have neither been leaked nor teased as of date, though speculations are high that the Google Pixel 2 and the Google Pixel 2 XL would feature the best internals that the mobile industry currently has to offer. With this in mind, there is a good chance that Google’s 2017 flagship devices would be fitted with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC, around 6GB of RAM and internal storage options starting at 64GB. A killer camera that exceeds the leaders in the smartphone photography industry is also widely rumored for the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL, according to a TechRadar report. Lastly, practical features such as waterproofing and a 3.5mm headphone jack are also expected to be showcased in the upcoming devices. One thing that has managed to surprise fans of the tech giant recently, however, is the news that Google might be going for a curved OLED design for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. According to an Electronic Times report, Google has attempted to strike a deal with LG to acquire flexible OLED panels for its 2017 flagship smartphones. Specifics of Google’s proposal have not been officially revealed by the tech giant, but speculations are high that Google is willing to pay $880 million to the South Korean tech firm to seal the deal. #Google #Pixel 2: in arrivo, ma forse senza #Jack per le cuffie – #GooglePixel2 #IPhone | https://t.co/9hWNAhyQ0a pic.twitter.com/f7kSZzvtP1 — Focustech.it (@focusTECHit) March 7, 2017 Considering that Google is rumored to be acquiring LG’s flexible OLED panels for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, speculations have begun to emerge that the upcoming flagship smartphones would be fitted with curved displays, akin to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Interestingly, many Google fans have reacted quite negatively to the news, stating that the tech giant’s flat-screened design in the current Pixel and Pixel XL are far more durable and significantly more useful than a design that features curved displays. A recently uploaded video from noted tech YouTube channel PocketNow, for example, asked users if they would prefer the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL to be fitted with curved displays. Interestingly, the response against the curved screen design is overwhelming. Numerous commenters were blunt, stating that while curved screens are indeed visually stunning, they make the smartphone extremely fragile. Not only this, but curved displays also have very limited uses, as seen in the current and last two generations of Samsung’s S-series devices. The Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL might see an official reveal sometime this coming August. Pricing for the upcoming devices has not been leaked as of date, though speculations are high that the smartphones would be priced at a premium.

IANS| Last Updated: Wednesday, April 19, 2017 - 08:17 Comment 0 Comment Pic courtesy: IANS Mumbai: Actress Poonam Pandey says her newly launched app, which she promised would have "bold" content, has been banned by Google. "I don't know why. I see many adult magazines on Play Store and App Store. It's interesting that on one hand Google Play Store is suspending the app and on the other some fans are 'complaining' that I am not even nude in the photos," Poonam said. She unveiled the app on Monday. She also tweeted: "Google has suspended the app but Android users can directly download #ThePoonamPandeyApp from my website." When IANS reached Google for a comment, Google spokesperson said: "We don't comment on individual applications. You can check out our policies for more information." Despite the "ban", Poonam seemed to be happy. She said: "I am very happy with the response as we got 15,000 downloads in less than 15 minutes." She said her team had decided that till the time the issue was resolved, everyone could download the app from her official website. "I would like to appeal to my fans, don't get disheartened. The issue shall be resolved soon." Poonam was last seen doing a special appearance in the 2017 film 'Aa Gaya Hero', which starred Govinda. Poonam made headlines for promising to go topless if the Indian cricket team won the World Cup in 2011.

One of the main new features on Google Earth is called Voyager, which is capable of providing users with an interactive guided tour. Voyager on Google Earth is able to provide fun facts, stories and other information on various locations around the globe. Google partnered with the likes of BBC Earth and the Gombe National Park to deliver 50 stories for Voyager. Google says that it will add more stories to Voyager every week. Google has already set up a Voyager story called “This is Home” that takes users on a journey to see traditional homes from cultures around the world. Google will be adding more homes to this Voyager story in the coming months. “With the new Earth, we want to open up different lenses for you to see the world and learn a bit about how it all fits together; to open your mind with new stories while giving you a new perspective on the locations and experiences you cherish,” Google Earth product manager Gopal Shah said in his blog post. Google’s “I’m feeling lucky” option has also made its way to the new Google Earth. When clicked, it will take users to a random and interesting place which they can explore. When a user lands on a place, they will also be able to open up what’s called a Knowledge Card to learn about the place’s history, facts and see more photos. There’s also a card for related places so users can instantly jump to a next location. Google says that it has curated 20,000 different places for this feature to work. The redesigned Google Earth includes a new 3D button, which allows users to view sites from any angle. Users can also share the 3D locations as a postcard for their friends and family, according to VentureBeat. The new Google Earth is now available on the web via the Chrome browser, and it will roll out to Android devices this week. The new Google Earth will be available to iOS devices and other browsers in the coming months. Google EarthMore The new Google Earth now lets users explore and learn more about places around the world.

Now the “skinny bundle” is disrupting that model with Internet-delivered packages offering live and on-demand programs. Google’s YouTube TV is the latest to enter this market with its bundle of around 40 channels for $35 monthly, challenging slim packages from Sony’s PlayStation Vue, Dish Network’s Sling TV and AT&T’s DirecTV Now. More entrants are expected including one from streaming service Hulu. These services offer easy interfaces like those of on-demand services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, let viewers digitally store programs in the Internet “cloud,” and toss in a limited selection of live channels to sate news and sports or other interests. Skinny offerings are aimed at young viewers and “cord cutters” loath to pay $100 or more to be force-fed hundreds of channels in hefty bundles and accustomed to streaming shows they want, when they desire. A Parks Associates survey last month found 20 per cent of American consumers dissatisfied with their pay TV service, leaving the market ripe for change. Analyst Glenn Hower at Parks said the market is in flux, with some consumers taking advantage of the easy sign-up for skinny packages, even though some cancel just as quickly. In addition to lower prices, he said, “you don’t have to worry about sending out a technician, you don’t have to worry about getting the equipment back.” BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield, in a research note titled “the big bundle is doomed,” says he expects skinny bundles to eat away at the established pay-TV providers. Established media companies are focusing too hard on “protecting their legacy business model” instead of giving consumers the flexibility they want, Greenfield wrote this month. Leichtman Research Group found that the top US cable companies lost 277,000 subscribers in 2016, while Internet-delivered services like Sling TV and DirecTV Now added about 845,000. These shifts could lead to a huge upheaval in the television ecosystem, allowing more choices and lower costs for consumers in many cases, while leaving smaller, independent cable channels out in the cold. The skinny bundles “have made inroads in the past year,” said Leichtman Research President Bruce Leichtman. Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said Google’s entry into the business is significant because “for the first time, the broadcasters are letting a powerful digital platform have the keys to its treasure room: live, first-run TV shows.” He noted that major tech firms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft “have tried to cozy up to TV for many years now, and all of them have been rebuffed” until now. “The digital platforms are indeed taking over the world, this time with permission from their former adversaries,” he said in a blog post. While many consumers use on-demand options like Amazon and Netflix, they often keep cable or satellite subscriptions for live sports and local news. But live channels will make streaming options more attractive. At the same time, popular channels such as HBO and sports programmer ESPN have been offering standalone subscriptions to allow consumers to watch without a bundle from cable or satellite. But independent television analyst Alan Wolk argues that the major pay TV firms remain in good shape despite these challenges. Some like AT&T already have a “skinny” offering, and others such as Comcast and Verizon are expected to enter the market to give consumers a choice. — AFP About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Berlin start-up offers a year with no money worries Bahrain National Gas Expansion Co raises $515 million loan → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Airport, Port and malls off limits to orange taxis Sultanate’s economy to grow by 3 per cent New rules to improve safety for children in school buses No foul poultry in Oman Read More ...

Ever since, he has searched for the next frontier of modern computing and how to be a part of it from the start. Now, Zuckerberg is betting he has found it: the real world. On Tuesday, Zuckerberg introduced what he positioned as the first mainstream augmented reality platform, a way for people to view and digitally manipulate the physical world around them through the lens of their smartphone cameras. What that means today is fairly limited. Augmented reality is nascent — people can add simple flourishes on top of their photos or videos, like sticking a pixelated blue beard on a selfie, or adding puppy stickers in the front yard of a photo of their house. But in Zuckerberg’s telling, there are few boundaries for how this technology will evolve. He said he envisioned a world in which people could eventually point smartphone cameras at a bowl of cereal and have an app create tiny sharks swimming in the milk. Friends can leave virtual notes for one another on the walls outside their favorite restaurants, noting which menu item is the most delicious. Apps like Pokemon Go, the breakout augmented reality hit that went viral globally last year, are just the beginning for Zuckerberg. One day, he mused, household objects could perhaps be replaced entirely by software. “Think about how many of the things around us don’t actually need to be physical,” Zuckerberg said in an interview last week. “Instead of a $500 TV sitting in front of us, what’s to keep us from one day having it be a $1 app?” Facebook does not expect to build all of these software experiences itself. At its annual developer conference Tuesday, the company called for computer programmers to help by building augmented reality-based apps to work with what Facebook calls its Camera Effects Platform. Facebook announced new tools to aid developers and will begin the initiative with a small number of partners in a closed test. Zuckerberg’s goal is ambitious — perhaps overly so. Augmented reality efforts have flopped in the past, including Google’s much-promoted attempt around spectacles with the technology, known as Google Glass. Facebook has previously gambled on other futuristic technologies — including virtual reality with a $2 billion purchase of Oculus, the virtual reality goggles maker, in 2014 — but Zuckerberg has acknowledged that it has had difficulty finding traction. He is also grappling with many issues that have the potential to distract Facebook. The company is under scrutiny for its position as an arbiter of mass media, and questions as to what role Facebook should play in policing content across its platform of nearly 2 billion regular users. That issue was thrust to the forefront this week after a man posted on his Facebook page a video of a murder he committed. Still, Zuckerberg said he intended to create the next major app ecosystem that would work with Facebook’s in-app camera. If successful, Facebook could be in a position similar to that of Apple, which relies on the hundreds of millions of apps in its store to keep users buying the company’s smartphones and tablets every year. Facebook, in turn, wants developers to build experiences that entice people to visit its website and apps on a daily — if not hourly — basis. “Just like Apple built the iPod and iTunes ecosystem before the iPhone, you want to make sure there’s a set of content there, even if there’s not everything,” Zuckerberg said. Facebook has been building toward this goal for some time. Zuckerberg has spent 18 months reorganizing his company and its suite of consumer apps — Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger — around a new interface, focused almost entirely on the camera. Slowly, the company has downplayed the role of text inside its apps, instead encouraging people to take and send photos and videos to one another by accessing the in-app camera features. In time, Facebook hopes that companies like Electronic Arts, Nike and Warner Bros. — which are part of the initial set of partners — will be the ones to bring immersive augmented reality experiences to Facebook’s platform. One early partner app is Giphy Thoughts, made by Giphy, a short-form video startup that acts as a search engine for animated GIFs. With Giphy Thoughts, for instance, people can attach cartoon thought bubbles above the heads of people they view through their Facebook camera lens. “It goes back to creative expression,” said David Rosenberg, director of business development at Giphy. “Facebook Camera is just going to be this massive audience of people ready to make deeply personal content they can share with their friends.” Hours before Facebook’s developer conference Tuesday, Snapchat — a professed “camera company” and Facebook’s direct competitor for attention — announced its own take on augmented reality, offering new 3-D lenses for use inside of its app. The effect is similar to some of the ideas Zuckerberg has described. Snapchat also offers Spectacles, glasses that allow users to record video from their faces. And two years ago, Microsoft unveiled its version of an augmented reality headset, called Holo­Lens. Another dark horse is Magic Leap, the secretive augmented reality startup that has an enormous investment from Google and Alibaba and is working on hardware to offer a similar experience. The company has yet to unveil an official product. For the near term, however, Zuckerberg sees the smartphone camera as the first step forward. “We want to get to this world in the future where you eventually have glasses or contact lenses where you can mix digital or physical objects in the digital world,” he said.

Linkedin is a bit rubbish isn't it? Despite being one of the most popular job sites/networks around, it's always been pretty awful and unintuitive to use – and there's hardly any goo alternatives too. However, in 2017 things are going to change, and after Facebook launched into the job world earlier this year, Google has just followed suite. Called Google Hire, the search giant's new job-site isn't up and running yet, but could be the jobs site we've been waiting for.   Although the site exists already, it's impossible to sign on – but we do know a few things about the forthcoming website. According to the website Axios, the new site will work much like a normal job site; allowing companies to post job listings so that people can search for their next job. However, the service also appears to come with the added bonus of working within the Google ecosystem, something that most companies, or individuals are already a part of. That should make the process of applying for jobs more easier and familiar, and that can only be a good thing. However, when this story first broke yesterday, several sites – including the Mail – suggests that Google Hire may allow employers to see your search history. As expected, that wasn't the case, and Google even emailed Engadget the statement below to clarify things. "Google Hire is a product under development that will help G Suite customers manage their hiring process more effectively. The product will allow employers to collect candidate applications online. Only information that a candidate voluntarily provides would be passed to a prospective employer as part of their online application. Private information will not be shared." So, will Google Hire take off? When it comes to jobs sites, Google is relatively late to the party – and with the likes of Linkedin and Monster dominating things, as well as Facebook's recent move into the job market – things might be tough for Google Hire. And although Google is a huge company, that should be able to compete, it's failed hugely in markets it's entered late, with the Google+ social network being a prime example. To stand a chance, Google will need to do something more intuitive and interesting than the competition. And as Google+ reminds us, it'll need to be more than just a new thing tacked on to your existing Gmail account.

Gorgeous screen. Best processor and modem available. Cons Awkward fingerprint scanner placement. Average battery life. Bottom Line The Samsung Galaxy S8 is a gorgeous big-screen phone with a comfortable single-handed feel, and it's packed with top-notch components and promising new software. By Sascha Segan Samsung sets the pace for smartphone power in 2017 with the Galaxy S8 ($750 as tested). It's the best phone at nearly everything it does, whether it's connecting to the internet, making calls, playing games, taking photos, or watching big-screen video. The S8 isn't leaps and bounds ahead of other top choices like the Google Pixel, but it's the overall most capable phone on the market, and our Editors' Choice. //Compare Similar Products Compare LG G6   %displayPrice%%seller% Samsung Galaxy S8+   %displayPrice%%seller% Google Pixel   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iPhone 7   %displayPrice%%seller% Samsung Galaxy S7   %displayPrice%%seller% Google Pixel XL   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iPhone 7 Plus   %displayPrice%%seller% ZTE Axon 7   %displayPrice%%seller% Motorola Moto Z   %displayPrice%%seller% Carriers and Pricing This is a review of the smaller Galaxy S8. There is also a larger Galaxy S8+ model, with a 6.2-inch screen and a larger battery. The Galaxy S8 is available from every major carrier in the US and several prepaid carriers. While it's only available from carriers right now, an unlocked version will follow in May or June. Prices in the US vary from $659 on Walmart's Total Wireless, to $750 at AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile (I tested the phone on Sprint and T-Mobile). You may also be able to get a promotional deal at big-box retailers like Best Buy or Target. We have a full rundown of the different prices and deals for the S8, and MobileSyrup has a good overview of Canadian prices. View All 12 Photos in Gallery It's also worth mentioning that this is a review of the US and Canadian unit of the phone. Other countries have a different device with a different Samsung Exynos processor that may function differently. Physical Design "The core idea behind the Galaxy S8...has been to deliver the biggest screen in the smallest device possible," Robert Kim, vice president of Samsung's global product strategy team, told me at Samsung's headquarters in Korea. "The contradiction is that [customers] want to have a bigger screen size but a small form factor," Kim added. By shrinking bezels and bending edges, Samsung makes that happen. The Galaxy S8 is proportionately tall and narrow. It's also very slippery, so you'll want a case. It measures 5.86 by 2.68 by 0.31 inches and weighs 5.47 ounces. That's taller than the Galaxy S7 (5.61 by 2.74 by 0.31 inches), but narrower—and remember, the S7 only has a 5.1-inch screen to the S8's 5.8-inch panel. The idea is you're going to use it in one hand. It's easy to wrap your fingers around the S8, even if you have relatively small hands. But you're still going to be shifting it up and down in your hand more often than you would with the S7 or the iPhone 7, to reach all of the vertical stretch of the screen. Almost all of the front face is the 5.8-inch, 2,960-by-1,440 Super AMOLED display, which Ray Soneira at DisplayMate has said in a comprehensive report is the best one on the market. It's bright and glowy, with saturated colors and great blacks. It's also a little smaller than Samsung says it is, because of the new 18.5:9 aspect ratio. Most phones are 16:9, so the S8 is taller and narrower than they are. It's even narrower, proportionately, than the LG G6, which is 2:1. The S8's screen is 13.23 square inches—I call that SQUID, or square inches of display. On a standard 16:9 aspect ratio phone, you get the same real estate in a 5.6-inch screen. So I think you should consider the S8's screen on par with the 5.5-inch, 16:9 displays on the Galaxy S7 Edge and iPhone 7 Plus. Above the screen, a notification LED blinks if you have unread notifications or a low battery. There's a new button on the left side. It's there to activate Bixby, Samsung's voice assistant. On the bottom there's a single speaker, along with a USB-C port and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The speaker sounds richer and less tinny than the S7's does. It's also about 1dB louder at its maximum volume. The phone comes in three colors: black, gray, and silver. I received black review units, and they get very smeary on the back. It's especially an issue because the fingerprint sensor is on the back right next to the camera lens, and while there's a slight ridge between them, it's almost unnoticeable. That means you will definitely smear the camera lens when you go to use the fingerprint scanner. The phone is waterproof, which will be a relief to many. But the all-glass body seems a bit fragile. Samsung said that by using Gorilla Glass 5 with a more gentle curve than on the Galaxy S7 Edge, it's made the phone more durable. At its manufacturing plant in Gumi, Korea, it showed me a four-foot drop test. Still, though, that glass back will be inherently more breakable than a metal back, and Samsung's curved glass is expensive to replace. "Compared to the S7, component wise, [durability] is a 40 percent improvement," Kim said. "Device-wise, it's around 20 percent." Using the Screen The Galaxy S8 has no physical home button. Instead, you press on the screen where you see a home button icon, and you feel a little bit of haptic feedback. It works just fine. The app drawer icon is gone, too—to get the app drawer, you swipe up from the home area. It takes a little getting used to. The aspect ratio definitely creates issues with third-party apps. YouTube videos, for instance, either have black bars on the sides, or get zoomed and cropped into full-screen mode. Samsung Mobile CEO DJ Koh said Facebook has already updated for the new size, and, "All of our major partners are working on it." On a settings screen called Full Screen Apps, I found that many text-oriented information and social networking apps, such as Microsoft Office, TripAdvisor, and Marvel Unlimited, are optimized for the tall screen, while most games are not. Everything runs, it just might not use the whole display. Launching an un-optimized game such as Mini Metro displays the game with black bars on either side of the screen. 21:9 wide-screen movies look great, with less letterboxing than on the Galaxy S7. 16:9 TV shows, on the other hand, have visible pillarboxing. Launching a 16:9 video in YouTube gives you the option to pillarbox the video, or to zoom and crop into full-screen mode, but that forces part of the image off of the screen. This is similar to the experience on the LG G6. Phone Calls, Networking, and Storage Yes, the Galaxy S8 makes phone calls. It has whatever your carrier's latest phone-calling techniques are (like HD Voice, VoLTE, and Wi-Fi calling) and calls sound clear, with aggressive noise cancellation in the microphone. I was especially impressed with the speakerphone volume when the Extra Volume button is pressed—the voice blasting out of the bottom-ported speaker is easily hearable outdoors. The rest of the networking alphabet soup is supported as well. There's dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, which I found worked about as well with our Netgear router as the Galaxy S7 does (which is to say, very well). The phone has NFC and MST, so you can do mobile payments even with old school magnetic credit card readers that don't support tap-to-pay. ANT+ is on board for certain smart home devices. This is the first phone with Bluetooth 5, which can potentially transmit to devices 120 feet away, as well as to two sets of headphones at once. However, there are no other Bluetooth 5 devices out there to test the S8 against yet. The phone comes in one size, 64GB with 4GB RAM, and there's also a microSD card slot tucked in with the SIM slot, which can handle 256GB cards. Samsung still doesn't support Google's Adoptable Storage mode, so the card will appear as a separate storage device. But you can move apps to the SD card from one of the settings pages. About 10.7GB of the phone's storage is taken up by the system and non-deletable apps. Battery Life Battery life is far better in real-world practice than it is in our benchmarks. With the same size battery as the S7 (3,000mAh) driving a larger, brighter screen, I got considerably shorter time on our screen-blasting LTE video streaming test: 5 hours, 45 minutes on the S8 compared with the S7's nearly 9 hours. That made me uncomfortable, so I tried some other scenarios. Dropping the screen resolution to 1080p got 7 hours, 39 minutes. Dropping to half brightness got twelve and a half hours. In real-life use over several days, with the screen generally at around half brightness, the S8 had no problem lasting through the day each time. In general, I ended up with about 30 percent battery after a 12-hour day before starting to charge again, with the shortest run-out time at about 16 hours and the longest well over 24 hours. The Google Pixel has a 1080p screen, and if you set the S8's screen to the same resolution, you get about the same usage time. But the Pixel is better at not draining battery in standby. The iPhone 7 has shorter screen-on usage time, but it's more efficient in standby and playing audio. The good news is that the S8's quick charging feature is very quick. The phone charges from zero to 100 percent in about an hour and a half. I got to 15 percent charge in 15 minutes, and 30 percent in half an hour. Samsung Mobile R&D VP Bookeun Oh told me, "I focused on maintaining the durability of the battery over the long term, over hundreds of charging cycles. For example, after approximately six months of normal usage, the battery in the S8 will outperform previous batteries. While most batteries hold about 80 percent of their charge after two years in usual cases, this battery should be capable of 95 percent of its original capacity." I'm also confident this phone won't explode. I took a trip to the factory where AT&T and Verizon units are made, saw Samsung's array of new tests, and spoke to the company's battery advisory council. Samsung is taking battery safety seriously in a way that it didn't with the Galaxy Note 7, and these phones are very extensively tested. Using a smaller battery than it could have, I'm sorry to say, is also part of the new focus on safety. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835: Snappy? The S8 is the first US phone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset. Qualcomm has been making a big deal about calling its chipsets platforms rather than processors, and some of that is because most of its improvements are in areas like DSPs, graphics, and modem capabilities, and not the individual CPU cores. See How We Test Phones You see this in the benchmarks. First of all, benchmark results change depending on what you have the screen resolution set to. Looking purely at the CPU, the single-core Geekbench score of 1,836 isn't any better than the Snapdragon 821-powered LG G6, at 1,811. The multi-core score of 5,960 outpaces the G6 (4,195), but only matches the Huawei Mate 9 and Huawei P10. But the 835 pumps a lot more graphics horsepower than those competitors do. On the most advanced GFXBenchmark Car Crash test, the Galaxy S8 pushed 12fps onscreen and 22fps offscreen at WQHD resolution. That's around double the G6 or P10's performance. Down at 1080p resolution, it scaled to 43fps onscreen, double the Google Pixel's result. Left to right: Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S7 Using the Snapdragon 835-optimized Samsung web browser gives the S8 superior JavaScript and web performance, too. It scored 71 on the JetStream Javascript benchmark, to the LG G6's 54 and the Google Pixel's 55. On the Browsermark web test, the Pixel scored 118 while the S8 made it to 145. That means snappier web page performance overall. Between this and the modem advances (described below), the benchmarks bear out Qualcomm's contention that device performance is more than just individual processor cores. Of course, that cuts both ways. While our test S8s were fast and smooth, Samsung devices have a reputation for lagging badly after a year or so (that's certainly happening with my S7). Because that lag is frequently solved by a factory reset, it's clear that the problem is in software, not hardware. Samsung has sworn up and down that the S8 won't have the creeping lag issues that previous models did. Of course, it's sworn the same thing before. There's no way to tell during the first week of use, alas. The Modem: The S8's Secret Weapon Smartphones aren't much use if they don't connect. The S8's invisible, secret weapon is that it's the first US phone with gigabit LTE and HPUE, combinations of four technologies that can improve performance on all four networks. I tested the phones on Sprint and T-Mobile, and found distinct improvements over the Galaxy S7. Samsung says all the carrier versions of the phone are identical, frequency band-wise. That means all U.S. Galaxy S8 phones will work on all the U.S. and Canadian carriers, as well as roaming globally. However, foreign phones may have some foreign LTE bands which are not common in the U.S. On Sprint, the S8 is the second phone (after the LG G6) with HPUE, which improves connectivity in weak signal conditions, especially with upload speeds. It delivers as promised. Over 34 tests in extremely weak signal conditions, only eight failed on the S8 while 24 failed on the S7. That's a major difference. In 48 tests of slightly better but still bad conditions, I got 2.33Mbps uploads on the S8 and only 1.3Mbps on the S7 (downloads were pretty much the same between them). As signal quality gets better, the S8's advantage fades. With decent signal, the S8 got 9.83Mbps down and 4.69Mbps up, while the S7 showed 7.41Mbps down and 4.79Mbps up. In our strongest signal test, both phones had no trouble hitting 120Mbps speeds right by a Sprint cell site. HPUE doesn't raise the roof—it raises the floor. The outcome for Sprint users: If you are frustrated with Sprint connectivity in a place where Sprint is supposed to have LTE, getting a Galaxy S8 will go a long way toward curing your dead-zone problem. The S8's advantage on T-Mobile is different. It combines several different technologies to potentially double download speeds. In T-Mobile's case, the difference should get more dramatic as speeds get better and faster, the opposite of the Sprint situation. I only ran ten tests on T-Mobile because of data limits, but I still saw the difference: 15.36Mbps down and 11Mbps up on the S8 compared with 8.65Mbps down and 10Mbps up on the S7. In congested areas, the S8 is the third phone (after the LG V20 and G6) to use its new Band 66 LTE network, which should prevent speeds from crashing too low. The phone should improve performance on AT&T and Verizon, as well. AT&T has called the S8 its first "5G Evolution" phone, which means it has the same three technologies that T-Mobile terms "gigabit LTE." AT&T's rollout is going a little more slowly than T-Mobile's, with Austin and Indianapolis getting the network first. Verizon has stayed irritatingly coy about its plans for gigabit technologies, but the same three elements should work on its network, too. In late 2016, Verizon said it had 3x carrier aggregation and 256 QAM, and it said it was deploying 4x4 MIMO more than a year ago. Verizon wouldn't confirm whether 4x4 MIMO is activated on its version of the phone, though. The S8 is also the first phone with LTE-U, a new form of LTE that uses Wi-Fi airwaves to enhance capacity in crowded areas. I haven't seen much in the way of LTE-U buildouts yet, but AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon are all working on it. Software: Taking Android to the Edge Samsung does not leave Android alone. You have to be OK with that to enjoy Samsung phones. The Galaxy S8 runs Android 7.0 Nougat, but with Samsung's icons, home screen, and apps added to Google's. And not just Samsung's: Our Sprint unit came with six Amazon apps, six "featured" apps, and eight Sprint apps for a total of twenty chunks of carrier bloatware. Fortunately, those are uninstallable. Samsung is also keeping its custom camera, gallery, music, and phone apps, although the music app is a downloadable option. The phone app now integrates a sticker and GIF messaging function that's tied to your Samsung Account, which will be able to be used if your friends also have Samsung accounts. The "always-on" front display has a more visually appealing design than on the S7, with a colorful spray of stars across the screen. Like on the S7, it shows the time and date or a calendar, as well as notification icons. Double-tapping on a notification icon shows you more information, or takes you to the app which was sending the notification. The really tall screen allows for a neat multitasking trick: You can select a chunk of an app's screen and pin it to the top, running other apps in the bottom half. That lets you watch a video while sending texts about it, for instance. You can swap the order of the back and multitasking buttons in the software. Press down on a home screen icon, and you get Google's Quick Option menu, letting you clear notification badges and uninstall the app. Samsung's edge functionality is better than ever. You swipe in from the right-hand side of the screen to see app shortcuts and your favorite contacts by default, and there are more than two dozen other Edge Panels you can download. There's a calendar, a calculator, a note-taking app, messengers, and system status widgets. They're genuinely useful. Also useful, but perpetually hidden in stacks of settings screens, are all of Samsung's custom settings options. Want to change the screen color gamut? The order of the virtual buttons at the bottom? Want to change what's shown on the always-on display? Samsung's phones have always been highly customizable, unless you're talking about getting rid of the Samsung stuff entirely. Three Ways To Prove Yourself Since Samsung seems to realize that putting its fingerprint scanner spot right next to the camera isn't the best idea, it offers up a buffet of other ways to authenticate yourself. The two more exotic ones are face and iris recognition. Face recognition is quick and easy. In our tests, it worked flawlessly and nearly instantly. But it also isn't secure, Samsung warns. I couldn't get it to unlock using a picture of my face, but others have been able to do so. That means it'll defeat casual attempts to unlock it, but not a determined antagonist who knows who you are. Iris recognition is more secure. It's also far pickier. Samsung advises that users take off their glasses to unlock their phones, which I'm happy to say isn't necessary. But iris recognition only worked eight out of 10 times for me, it's slower than other methods, and I was often bombarded by prompts to move the phone higher and farther away. Complicating things, you can use your iris or fingerprint for Samsung Pay, but not your face. I started out not using the fingerprint scanner, but after a few days, I was using it regularly. The change happened when I put the S8 in a Caseology Legion case, which has a slanted cutout for the fingerprint scanner and camera. The case cutout gave me the tactile cues I needed to hit the fingerprint scanner without smudging the camera. Bye Bye Bixby Samsung's flagship new service, Bixby, can't be tested yet. It won't be launched until May. The idea behind Bixby is that you push a dedicated button on the side of the phone and you're able to command it by voice, for instance, to send a photo you just took to someone in your contact list. According to Samsung Mobile CTO Injong Rhee, Bixby will initially work with ten built-in apps, including camera, contacts, gallery, phone, reminders, and settings, but notably not the browser, calendar, or email. Rhee said those will come in the second batch of 10, and the company has 32 apps targeted. "Right now, our focus is on the device interface and application controls," Rhee said. "As Bixby's ecosystem expands, clearly there's an overlap between what Bixby can pursue and what Google Assistant can pursue. We are working with Google...so we can actually benefit from both." For the record, "OK Google" works just fine on this phone. Pressing the Bixby button right now takes you to "Hello Bixby," Samsung's answer to Google Now's stack of personalized cards. By default, it shows your most recently taken photos, reminders, weather, and a news feed, although with time it's supposed to prompt you with apps and information it thinks you might want—pushing Uber at you if you take an Uber at the same time each day, for instance. Other much-heralded new software remains similarly elusive. Samsung Connect is supposed to bring together all of your (new) Samsung appliances and SmartThings Hub functionality. It doesn't work yet, so I can't judge it. Samsung's Dex, a system to turn your phone into a desktop PC, also isn't ready yet. See our in-depth look at DeX for more details. Best Camera Ever The Galaxy S8 has a 12-megapixel camera, just like the S7. But it's better. I took side-by-side images with the S7 and S8 in a variety of modes, and the S8's pictures are clearer and brighter, with more detail and less artifacting. While the S8 doesn't have dual main cameras, there's a software-based Selective Focus mode to create bokeh, and a pretty good Pro mode that includes Raw capture and manual shutter speed. Low-light performance has taken a step up, too. Compared with the S7, shots taken in very low light show noticeably more detail on the S8. The S8 outpaces the Pixel in low light, too, with sharper detail, less artifacting, and slightly better colors. I'm comfortable saying that the S8 has the best phone camera I've seen, although I'm also going to turn the phone over to our camera analyst for a longer look. The front-facing camera has improved from 5MP to 8MP, and it's gotten autofocus. In practice, that means sharper focus on faces, with backgrounds going slightly out of focus. That makes photos of yourself look great, but it means that if you're used to taking photos of yourself in front of things—famous buildings, for instance—you'll have to make sure to lock focus on the distant object to get the same fixed-focus look you're used to. As light gets lower, the front-facing camera gets a bit soft, but it keeps skin tones warm. I prefer this approach to what the Pixel does, which makes my face look pale and dirty as it tries to dramatically brighten my features. Actual exposure isn't necessarily better than the S7, but you have more pixels, so things don't look quite as soft. Both cameras record video as well, of course, to true 4K with the main camera, and 2,560-by-1,440 with the front camera, both at 30fps in all circumstances. There's also a 60fps 1080p (barely) slow-mo option. The main camera has OIS and the front camera doesn't, but in general, they're both excellent video cameras, much as the S7's was as well. One new gimmick, Bixby Vision, isn't a great differentiator. It's a mode in the camera that can shop for products or translate text based on a picture you take. But it's no better than Google Translate or Microsoft Word Lens (in fact, the translator just uses Google Translate). It's not a minus, it's just not much of a plus. Comparisons and Conclusions Phones are connected devices. That's also what they do: connect us, to each other and to the internet. We create things, whether they're words or pictures, and we share them. The Galaxy S8 is the best phone available for creating things you want to share, sharing them, and experiencing things shared by others. It's the most connected device possible. That said, the Google Pixel is less expensive than most S8 carrier models at $649. While the S8 is slightly better in many ways, the Pixel has a cleaner interface, more frequent Android updates, and longer standby battery life. For AT&T and Verizon users, meanwhile, the unlocked ZTE Axon 7 and OnePlus 3T deliver all of the power most people want for around $400. The S8 securely kills the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in our eyes, though. While the iPhone SE is still an excellent value, platform lock-in is pretty much the only reason to get an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus over this device—the idea that you've spent so much time and money learning Apple's apps and using iMessage that it would be too much of a bear to leave. But the phone is expensive enough that I would hesitate to upgrade from an S7, unless you think the better modem will help you connect where you couldn't before. The S8 is better than the S7 in every way except battery life, but it's a lot of money for incremental improvements. I prefer the S8 to its larger sibling the S8+, though. This is purely a taste issue, as I love how the S8 is comfortable in one hand, even with a case on. The S8+ adds a bit more battery life and a bigger screen for $100 more, but doesn't add any other functionality, and I don't think the trade-off for usability is quite worth it. People with large hands, of course, may disagree. The Galaxy S8 is the most luxurious, best performing phone on the market right now. It's on fire, and I don't mean that literally. Maybe it's more phone than most people need. But it's almost certainly better than the phone you have. And for that reason it's our Editors' Choice.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research.

Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Nope. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ?

Last month, the company pushed an unfinished Google Drive for Windows update, causing Drive to break for thousands of users. Now Google has accidentally released a confidential build of the May 2017 security update to normal Pixel XL owners. We've received a few reports of the update so far, and our own Artem has received the update on his Pixel XL as well. As you can see from the below screenshot, this was clearly not meant for public release:   There isn't any user-visible changes in this update, which has a build number of N2G470. One tipster said he received the new Play Store UI after updating, but that's likely just a server-side change that was flipped by coincidence.

JD Ok Google go home you're drunk whispy_snippet What is this amateur hour?! NinoBr0wn "Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart. Last month, the company pushed an unfinished Google Drive for Windows update, causing Drive to break for thousands of users." Edit: ..causing Drive to break for tens of users. Corbin Davenport Between all the posts on the Drive Product Forums, Twitter, Reddit, and other sites, there were definitely thousands (myself included). NinoBr0wn That comment definitely wasn't being facetious. But this one is. Trooper311 Nothing showed up for me on my PIxel Xl. I am sure they have fixed the issue by now. derk p :: checks software update:: Nothing showed up for me on my Pixel. I am sure they have fixed the issue by now. Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. Total Insecurity Google needs to bring their machine learning technology to the next step and help them to differ between testers and customers! mrjayviper doesn't seemed to be a problem with Apple and I doubt they use any AI (or at least to Google's level) on their OTA updates PhantomGamers He was joking... -.- Sir_Brizz No compromises device. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 stan gurule Same here on my HTC 10. Adam Margeson Same what? stan gurule Whatever dogfood update it was, everyone else was saying "same here" so I had too also. Wasn't serious though... 4Ui812 It wasn't an accident it's Google. They been fucking up a lot shit lately. JohnyNoLegs Prob shows that customers are getting beta/alpha/dogfood builds anyway. pks OTA link: https://ota.googlezip.net/packages/ota-api/google_marlin_marlin/6ea1ccda14a13cd03ab763d27fd7047025a53d3f.zip MrJakeK Next can we talk how horrible their beta forum is? Open non-private GooglePlus board where all the comments are random jerks asking for beta on their old broken phones? Google take notes from Motorola, you owned them for a second you should have learned. YuCMi I guess the idea of "being professional" is lost on Google. Karen Fennell I got this as well! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/329aa615888972a22bb6aed46e9dc9321d2ef29076d01d8cfa5c7cd3f0277b50.png Nathan J "Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart." They seem to be taking a page out of Bethesda's book. All of the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games released in the past 15 years have been buggy messes. And like Android, they are usually fixed by a dedicated community of developers. That settles it. Google needs to release Android for the Pip-boy. /s The limited edition Pip-boy can hold a phone, but I don't think any Android phones are small enough. Maybe, just maybe the Xperia Mini line. It seems to have been made with the iPhone 6 in mind. Sadly, it can't charge one and blocks the port. If someone could 3D print, paint, and polish up a good one, I can see an Android phone where the screen goes, a 10,000mAh power pack where the tape deck is, and wires on the inside connecting the two. The official Pip-boy design is too bulky for practicality, but a slimmer design meant for bigger phones, like the S8/+, G6, Pixel XL, iPhone Plus, etc., holding the phone at an angle over the arm, could be very cool. Especially with an interface geared toward one-handed, landscape use. Anonymous Vagrant What's the name of the download speed monitor app seen on the screenshots? iCoerce I have the new play store ui on both my 3T and S7. 3T running 7.1.2 and my S7 still only on 7.0, so that was definitely just a server side switch. jon Glad to know they do that. Jaufder in Granite Bay (Sac) My Pixel XL has gone absolutely batshit since the 7.1.2 upgrade I did last week. I had previously been dealing with battery problems noted on 7.1.1 ( which mysteriously resolved even before I upgraded to 7.1.2). Now, with 7.1.2, my phone app is locking up, audio is cutting out and/or making amazingly loud crackling noises, headphone audio stops working periodically, the phone randomly shuts off, phone calls won't hang up...etc, etc. It's barely useable at this point. Aufar Ramadhan My Nexus 6 running Android 7.1.1 is perfect! No downgrades, and no bugs! Gonna flash LineageOS before 2018. Sudev Seems they did it on purpose... They're showcasing that they are "internally testing" things before they release it to public. /s Teja Don't know why lately Google has been messing up things. Nexus 6P OTA with major issues causing rollback, Pixel 7.1.2 OTA having fingerprint issues and this one. P. Sherman Please remind me again on how Google is still "superior" to Samsung and OnePlus for pulling s--- like this. As if they weren't content enough on disabling fingerprint readers and borking Bluetooth connectivity... Sumeet Gandhi It updated the playstore for me on my Pixel XL. Now it looks pretty neat tough.

You may recall that last year, Google added a warning in the Phone app for when a suspected spam caller was ringing. Now the company is bringing that same feature to Google Voice. According to a post on the Google Voice Help Forum, the new filter catches twice as many spammers, reports 40% more calls correctly as spam, and results in 20% fewer reports from users. Again, this is the same feature that the Phone app on Pixel, Nexus, and Android One devices already have - Google Voice users just get to enjoy it too. You can make sure it's on by enabling spam filtering in the webapp or mobile app. See the link below for the original source.

File/AP NEW YORK — U.S. stocks fell Tuesday after weak first-quarter reports from Johnson & Johnson and Goldman Sachs frustrated investors who hope company earnings are on the rise. Health care companies lost the most. Wall Street has high hopes for earnings this spring, and weak results from the world's largest health care products company and one of the biggest financial firms had them concerned. Investors also looked for safety after the British government called for a surprise early election next month. According to S&P Global Markets Intelligence, investors expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to rise almost 10 percent compared to last year. That would be the biggest jump since 2014. The S&P 500 index shed 6.82 to close at 2,342.19. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 113.64 to 20,523.28, with Goldman Sachs responsible for most of that loss. The Nasdaq fell 7.32 to 5,849.47. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks recovered from an early loss and rose 0.71 to 1,361.89. Google Earth gets tools for exploration NEW YORK — Google Earth is getting a revival, with the 3-D mapping service becoming more of a tool for adventure and exploration. A central feature in the new Google Earth is Voyager. Google has partnered with such groups as the BBC, NASA and "Sesame Street" to mix in video clips, photos and text narratives. Before Google Maps brought in real-world imagery, Google Earth was the place to go to for satellite views and 3-D images stitched together from aerial fly-bys. A software download was required, limiting its use. With the update, Google Earth now works on desktop browsers. Google has a mobile app for Android but not iPhones or iPads yet. +1  Steve Ballmer. File/AP Ex-Microsoft CEO compiles spending data NEW YORK — Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has created a new organization to analyze government spending and revenue to make it easier to understand. He says he created USAFacts because he was frustrated he couldn't find a single source that combined all the relevant state and federal numbers. Ballmer gathered a group of data specialists that spent nearly three years compiling the information for its first reports, which are available online at www.USAFacts.org . The reports will be updated periodically. The former Microsoft executive says he wants to provide clear information on government spending, adding that he hopes it will be easier to discuss divisive issues if everyone can agree on the basic facts. He announced the effort Tuesday in a speech at the Economic Club of New York. IMF: global economy set to accelerate WASHINGTON — A resilient China, rising commodity prices and sturdy financial markets are offering a sunnier outlook for the global economy and helping dispel the gloom that has lingered since the Great Recession ended. That's the picture sketched by the International Monetary Fund, which predicts that the world economy will grow 3.5 percent this year, up from 3.1 percent in 2016. The IMF's latest outlook for 2017 is a slight upgrade from the 3.4 percent global growth it had forecast in January. The IMF expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.3 percent, up from 1.6 percent in 2016; the 19-country eurozone to expand 1.7 percent, the same as last year; Japan to grow 1.2 percent, up from 1 percent; and China to expand 6.6 percent, down from 6.7 percent in 2016. Fruity Pebbles owner to buy Weetabix NEW YORK — Post Holdings, the company behind Fruity Pebbles, Honey Bunches of Oats and other cereals, said Tuesday that it is buying the maker of British breakfast brand Weetabix as it seeks to expand overseas. It is paying about $1.8 billion to buy Weetabix from its owners, Shanghai-based Bright Food Group and Baring Private Equity Asia. Besides its namesake cereal, Weetabix also makes Alpen, Barbara's Puffins and other cereals. Post said the deal will allow it to grow its U.S. brands internationally and expand Weetabix in North America. Weetabix, a rectangular wheat biscuit that breaks apart when it absorbs milk, is little known in the U.S. but is the second-biggest ready-to-eat cereal brand in the U.K., according to market research company Euromonitor. The deal is expected to close by September. KFC changing chicken sandwich prep NEW YORK — KFC is aiming to take a bigger bite out of the chicken sandwich market by changing how it prepares them. The chain says it is hoping to improve the taste and is switching from filets that were breaded and frozen offsite before being shipped to the stores in favor of filets breaded at the stores. That's similar to how rivals Chick-fil-A and Popeye's already prepare their chicken. For  KFC, the switch is part of a push to revive business and court younger customers.  A key step is gaining a bigger share of the chicken sandwich market, which KFC says accounts for 40 percent of the fast-food industry's chicken category. Its new "Zinger" chicken sandwich will be introduced next week. Bass Pro, Cabela tweak buyout deal SIDNEY, Neb. — Bass Pro Shops acquisition of rival outdoor gear retailer Cabela's looks a bit more likely with a cheaper price and new terms of the credit card unit's sale. Cabela's said Bass Pro will pay $61.50 per share, or $4.2 billion, for the company, down from $65.50 per share, or $4.5 billion. The company declined to say why the price was cut. Cabela's also says Georgia-based bank Synovus will now buy the credit-card unit as a middleman. Synovus will keep its $1.2 billion in deposits before reselling it to the original purchaser Capital One. Capital One had said banking regulators questioned the deal because of an unrelated issue. Cabela's CEO Tommy Millner says the changes make the deal more certain.

(AP) — If you didn't know better, you might think this New Hampshire town is best known for gun-toting wedding parties. A Google search for the town of Londonderry has repeatedly turned up a wedding photo of resident and Republican state Rep. Al Baldasaro with five women, including the bride, posing with rifles while wearing their wedding attire. Town Manager Kevin Smith said the photo appeared earlier this year, prompting the town to send a letter in February to Google asking for it to be removed. That seemed to do the trick but then the photo resurfaced again this week, prompting the town to reach out to Google again. The latest image was a near-duplicate of the one that was removed earlier this year, and was posted on a different page. This new image was pulled into Google's Knowledge Panel algorithmically. By Tuesday afternoon, the wedding photo had been replaced by a town map. Rather than a family wedding photo, Smith would prefer the town get noticed for its apple orchards, accomplished high school band that has marched in four Tournament of Roses parades, or its status as home to Manchester-Boston Regional Airport. "It's not that we take great exception with the photo. It's that we don't think that it's representative of the town," Smith said. "Well, we think there are so many other images that represent the town more fairly, and we have named then in the letters we have sent to Google." In its letter to Google, the town's attorney claimed critics of Baldasaro raised the profile of the photo by sharing it numerous times on social media, hoping it would have been deemed embarrassing enough to help defeat Baldasaro last November. Google confirmed the image had been removed. Baldasaro, who won re-election and was an early supporter of President Donald Trump, said he agrees the photo should not represent the town. He said his wife, Judy, had written to Google on Monday night to request that it decouple the photo from the town's biographical information. "My picture has no business being up there," he said Tuesday. "But I've got no control over it. I just found out yesterday it was up there again." But he insisted there was nothing inherently wrong with the photo — which he says was his wife's idea and was taken as a joke after a fellow legislator showed up at his wedding with his guns. "I have no regrets whatsoever. I only wish I could take credit for it," he said. "I love the picture. I don't care if anyone doesn't like it. Tough. They'll get over it. The second Amendment is a beautiful thing." Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Google Pixel 2 Update: LG Partnership Strengthens OLED Display Integration For Flagship Joseph PatrickApr 18, 2017 03:34 AM EDT Facebook Linkedin Twitter Google+ Print Email The Google Pixel 2 is one of them much-awaited devices and the smartphone could be getting a huge bump in the form of an OLED display screen. This was already suggested before but the anticipated partnership between LG and Google should finally turn that rumor into a reality. If so, the Google Pixel 2 will invade the curved OLED display screen party that Samsung and Apple are currently in. Samsung was the first to introduced the technology and the word out right now is that the same will be applied to the upcoming iPhone 8, 9 to 5 Mac reported. But the difference here is the supplier.

Samsung will reportedly supply Apple with the OLED screens and play a key role in the supply chain management for related components. For the Google Pixel 2, LG will be the supply partner. The word out is that Google has offered roughly one trillion Korean won (approximate $800 million), Forbes reported. With the money involved, it looks like Google is making sure that the Google Pixel 2 has enough OLED displays available, averting the supply problems that the iPhone 8 could be facing later this year. LG has not formally accepted the offer but the belief is that they are interested. An official announcement for the deal could be out soon. Most are awaiting the next Google Pixel installments with hardware chief Rick Osterloh confirming that new models will be coming. This would include the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2, both of which are set to come out this 2017. For those who haven’t heard, the Google Pixel 2 will reportedly come powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset, a 16 MP main camera and a front-facing 8 MP shooter aside from the curved OLED display. Other specs could include the advanced biometric security in play to date plus the usual RAM, internal storage and sufficient battery complement.

(Photo : Google Nexus/YouTube) After rumors point at Google retiring the Nexus 6P device, it seems that the rumors are turning into facts. Due to the constant problems on Nexus 6P device - from bootloop to premature shut down - Google and Huawei might be facing class action lawsuit. Angry users are complaining for the unusable Nexus 6P after the problems persist. The issue started when some users upgraded their handsets to Android 7.0 Nougat. There have been a few glitches, as well, following the premature shutdown. According to the lawsuit filed by Chimicles & Tikellis LLP, the problem still persists even when the handsets were downgraded to Marshmallow. To add more, LG-made Nexus 5X was reportedly getting a similar issue as some people complained the bootlooping has caused their handsets stuck in a cycle of restart and boot up process, Android Community reported. Google shows its support by releasing a stable Android 7.1.2 for Nexus 6P and it requires at least 26MB of space. The software version is rolled out specifically to the Nexus 6P devices and it comes with bug fixes and a few improvements on the battery and camera departments. It is reported that the current software fixes audio issue. However, the recent update has caused another problem as some users face fingerprint reader bug, Android Authority reported. Nexus 6P has been one of the most-favorite Android smartphones especially with the pure Android experience and the budget-friendly price that could actually be an affordable version of Google Pixel. There have been rumors that after what happened to Nexus devices, Google might actually retire the Nexus 6P without bothering to launch a refreshed handset. The lawsuits are piling up before the Pixel 2 comes out and now tech crowds are waiting for any update that could convince them, that the impending iPhone rival will be much different than the rest Nexus devices.     Tags Google Pixel, Google Nexus 6P, nexus 6p problem, nexus 6p bootloop, nexus 6p battery © 2017 University Herald, All rights reserved.

Googles updates have addressed things that needed to be fixed as well as broken things that were working just fine before an update. The Pixel XL received an unexpected OTA notification today. Source: Android Police A number of readers have contacted Android Police as they received an OTA notification for a software update that reads: CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL ONLY  This is a confidential Googlers-only OTA to update your Pixel XL with May 2017 security patches The update takes up about 62MB of storage. Given the small size of the security update, and the fact that theres nothing significantly (visually) different in the new update, there cant be much harm done. One user reported that he got the new Play Store UI after installing the update, which could have set-off a server-side change in the Play Store. Has anyone else received this update? Have you noticed anything else different? Let us know if your Play Store UI was updated as well.

Google accidentally pushed a Dogfood test build of the May 2017 security update to the Pixel XL Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 4:20pm PDTApr 18, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 85 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Applications Google News Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart. Last month, the company pushed an unfinished Google Drive for Windows update, causing Drive to break for thousands of users. Now Google has accidentally released a confidential build of the May 2017 security update to normal Pixel XL owners. We've received a few reports of the update so far, and our own Artem has received the update on his Pixel XL as well. As you can see from the below screenshot, this was clearly not meant for public release:   There isn't any user-visible changes in this update, which has a build number of N2G470. One tipster said he received the new Play Store UI after updating, but that's likely just a server-side change that was flipped by coincidence. Let us know in the comments below if you see it on your phone. Thanks: Everyone who sent this in Tags dogfood Google N2G470 ota security update update subscribe ...

Last month, the company pushed an unfinished Google Drive for Windows update, causing Drive to break for thousands of users." Edit: ..causing Drive to break for tens of users. Corbin Davenport Between all the posts on the Drive Product Forums, Twitter, Reddit, and other sites, there were definitely thousands (myself included). NinoBr0wn That comment definitely wasn't being facetious. But this one is. Trooper311 Nothing showed up for me on my PIxel Xl. I am sure they have fixed the issue by now. derk p :: checks software update:: Nothing showed up for me on my Pixel. I am sure they have fixed the issue by now. Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. Total Insecurity Google needs to bring their machine learning technology to the next step and help them to differ between testers and customers! mrjayviper doesn't seemed to be a problem with Apple and I doubt they use any AI (or at least to Google's level) on their OTA updates PhantomGamers He was joking... -.- Sir_Brizz No compromises device. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂😂😂 stan gurule Same here on my HTC 10. Adam Margeson Same what? stan gurule Whatever dogfood update it was, everyone else was saying "same here" so I had too also. Wasn't serious though... 4Ui812 It wasn't an accident it's Google. They been fucking up a lot shit lately. JohnyNoLegs Prob shows that customers are getting beta/alpha/dogfood builds anyway. pks OTA link: https://ota.googlezip.net/packages/ota-api/google_marlin_marlin/6ea1ccda14a13cd03ab763d27fd7047025a53d3f.zip MrJakeK Next can we talk how horrible their beta forum is? Open non-private GooglePlus board where all the comments are random jerks asking for beta on their old broken phones? Google take notes from Motorola, you owned them for a second you should have learned. YuCMi I guess the idea of "being professional" is lost on Google. Karen Fennell I got this as well! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/329aa615888972a22bb6aed46e9dc9321d2ef29076d01d8cfa5c7cd3f0277b50.png Nathan J "Google seems to have a problem with keeping testers and customers apart." They seem to be taking a page out of Bethesda's book. All of the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games released in the past 15 years have been buggy messes. And like Android, they are usually fixed by a dedicated community of developers. That settles it. Google needs to release Android for the Pip-boy. /s The limited edition Pip-boy can hold a phone, but I don't think any Android phones are small enough. Maybe, just maybe the Xperia Mini line. It seems to have been made with the iPhone 6 in mind. Sadly, it can't charge one and blocks the port. If someone could 3D print, paint, and polish up a good one, I can see an Android phone where the screen goes, a 10,000mAh power pack where the tape deck is, and wires on the inside connecting the two. The official Pip-boy design is too bulky for practicality, but a slimmer design meant for bigger phones, like the S8/+, G6, Pixel XL, iPhone Plus, etc., holding the phone at an angle over the arm, could be very cool. Especially with an interface geared toward one-handed, landscape use. Anonymous Vagrant What's the name of the download speed monitor app seen on the screenshots? iCoerce I have the new play store ui on both my 3T and S7. 3T running 7.1.2 and my S7 still only on 7.0, so that was definitely just a server side switch. jon Glad to know they do that. Jaufder in Granite Bay (Sac) My Pixel XL has gone absolutely batshit since the 7.1.2 upgrade I did last week. I had previously been dealing with battery problems noted on 7.1.1 ( which mysteriously resolved even before I upgraded to 7.1.2). Now, with 7.1.2, my phone app is locking up, audio is cutting out and/or making amazingly loud crackling noises, headphone audio stops working periodically, the phone randomly shuts off, phone calls won't hang up...etc, etc. It's barely useable at this point. Aufar Ramadhan My Nexus 6 running Android 7.1.1 is perfect! No downgrades, and no bugs! Gonna flash LineageOS before 2018. Sudev Seems they did it on purpose... They're showcasing that they are "internally testing" things before they release it to public. /s Teja Don't know why lately Google has been messing up things. Nexus 6P OTA with major issues causing rollback, Pixel 7.1.2 OTA having fingerprint issues and this one. P. Sherman Please remind me again on how Google is still "superior" to Samsung and OnePlus for pulling s--- like this. As if they weren't content enough on disabling fingerprint readers and borking Bluetooth connectivity... Sumeet Gandhi It updated the playstore for me on my Pixel XL. Now it looks pretty neat tough.

The newest version of Google Earth started to roll out this week and with it the search engine has introduced new immersive content that allows users to partake in an adventure with the click of a button. Scientists and documentarians have worked with Google to curate digital tours with the Voyager interface, which links users to high quality videos of the land and provides unique interviews to help give personal insight into what the location has to offer. Up to 50 tours are already available online, some created in collaboration with BBC's Planet Earth. Google Postcards from the Grand Canyon and Château de Chambord. (Google Earth) The "I'm feeling lucky" feature has also been updated with 20,000 different "hidden gems". The online service whisks users away to a random location and presents a knowledge card with a snippet of information from Wikipedia about the area. Users will no longer have to specify an exact location for a search and can input more general information, like 'capital of Australia', to arrive at a destination. Google had dabbled in 3D views but its newest update provides high-definition imagery that gives users a chance to take in unprecedented levels of detail in the geographical landscape or surrounding man-made architecture. Friends and family can also share in your digital adventure, with Google providing an online postcard that links them to the exact location you have visited.  © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 Technology World TRENDING VIDEO Melania reminds President Trump to raise hand for national anthem The First Lady will be moving to the White House this summer, and — if this video is anything to go by — her presence will be a huge help to her husband.

(AP) — If you didn't know better, you might think this New Hampshire town is best known for gun-toting wedding parties. A Google search for the town of Londonderry has repeatedly turned up a wedding photo of resident and Republican state Rep. Al Baldasaro with five women, including the bride, posing with rifles while wearing their wedding attire. Town Manager Kevin Smith said the photo appeared earlier this year, prompting the town to send a letter in February to Google asking for it to be removed. That seemed to do the trick but then the photo resurfaced again this week, prompting the town to reach out to Google again. The latest image was a near-duplicate of the one that was removed earlier this year, and was posted on a different page. This new image was pulled into Google's Knowledge Panel algorithmically. By Tuesday afternoon, the wedding photo had been replaced by a town map. Rather than a family wedding photo, Smith would prefer the town get noticed for its apple orchards, accomplished high school band that has marched in four Tournament of Roses parades, or its status as home to Manchester-Boston Regional Airport. "It's not that we take great exception with the photo. It's that we don't think that it's representative of the town," Smith said. "Well, we think there are so many other images that represent the town more fairly, and we have named then in the letters we have sent to Google." In its letter to Google, the town's attorney claimed critics of Baldasaro raised the profile of the photo by sharing it numerous times on social media, hoping it would have been deemed embarrassing enough to help defeat Baldasaro last November. Google confirmed the image had been removed. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. Baldasaro, who won re-election and was an early supporter of President Donald Trump, said he agrees the photo should not represent the town. He said his wife, Judy, had written to Google on Monday night to request that it decouple the photo from the town's biographical information. "My picture has no business being up there," he said Tuesday. "But I've got no control over it. I just found out yesterday it was up there again." But he insisted there was nothing inherently wrong with the photo — which he says was his wife's idea and was taken as a joke after a fellow legislator showed up at his wedding with his guns.

Newsby Edgar Cervantes5 hours ago 10 173 14 Google introduced the “Free App of the Week” section to the Google Play Store only about three weeks ago. It was all fine and dandy until today, when the dedicated page suddenly disappeared and was replaced with an error message. What gives? We have no idea what is going on, but our own Kris Carlon took it to Twitter to ask the team managing the Google Play Store account exactly what’s going on. @GooglePlay What happened to the “free app of the week” section that used to live here: https://t.co/bRsNJLhk9p — Kris Carlon (@kriscarlon) April 18, 2017 No response has shown up yet, but we continue to keep our eyes open for any news. It’s possible Google has decided the program is not worth keeping around, or something changed along the line. Maybe this is just temporary and the “Free App of the Week” will soon make its triumphant return. We will have to wait and see. Until more information emerges, do hit the comments and let us know if this is something you were actually taking advantage of. Did you get any free apps from this now-gone section?

Name: Subject: Message: Latest Google Wifi update causing issues, Google working on a fix Newsby Brian Reigh4 hours ago 3 82 2 Some people are complaining that the latest build – 9202.35.8 – is causing their Google Wifi hub to turn into a solid blue state; fortunately, Google has acknowledged this issue and will be releasing a fix in the near future. See also: Google Wifi review December 6, 2016 Just last year, Google introduced the Google Wifi, its own answer to many of the problems that conventional Wi-Fi routers pose. The mesh system promises better connectivity and subtler aesthetics, and while Google’s router was very well-received at launch, it’s had its own issues. This time, it’s a problem with basic connectivity. Unfortunately, a hard reset doesn’t seem to solve the problem. A user named Jacob F took to Google’s product forums to complain that after the most recent update to 9202.35.8, his Google Wifi hub would randomly turn into a solid blue state, indicating connectivity issues. The thread has since gained multiple replies, which show that while not all, a significant number of other Google Wifi users have been affected by this exact same issue. Unfortunately, a hard reset doesn’t seem to solve the problem. The good news is, however, that Google was able to locate and reproduce the issue and is working on a fix. In the meantime, Google’s Wifi Care Team suggests two workarounds that could help resolve the issue temporarily: Attempt to setup GWifi from scratch using a different owner account. This can mean creating a new Google account, or using a family member’s Google account to setup the Google Wifi devices through the GW app. Disconnect wireless Windows 10 devices or Xbox devices (or connect them via ethernet instead). There have been a few cases in which disconnecting any Windows 10 devices or Xbox devices has brought the Google Wifi network back up again without crashes. As noted by the team, you can also reach out to their support team (g.co/wificare), “who will be able to provide more deep-dive troubleshooting advice based on the topography of your network.” Is your Wi-Fi hub affected by the issue? Have those workarounds been useful? Let us know by leaving a comment down below!

Now there are various services out there that protects against such calls, and Google Voice is one of them. In a post on the Google Voice Help Forum, “To better protect you from unwanted calls, we’ve recently improved our spam filter for Google Voice. Using the same technology that powers spam protection in Pixel, Nexus, and Android One devices, we now catch 2x more spammers, receive 20% fewer spam reports from users, and identify 40% more calls correctly as spam than ever before.” It should be noted that last year Google’s Phone app had a feature where it warned users that the call they are about to answer could be from a spam caller, so we guess this feature has now been extended to Google Voice, so now Google Voice users will be able to enjoy the same level of protection. Like we said there are various services offered that protect users on a carrier level. For example last year AT&T launched a service that would protect customers from spam calls, but we guess having more filters to catch these calls is always welcome. Filed in Cellphones.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Military News Samurai LLC’s Publishes Review Of the Amazing Selling Machine Nick Sasaki, in the online marketing industry for 10 years, began with marketing through the Google adwords feature. Couple of years before, when it was rescinded, Nick moved to marketing online through the use of search engine optimization on Google. However, owing to Google’s constantly changing algorithms, and with it becoming increasingly more difficult to gain presence among the top search results, Nick began looking for something which would provide a greater return on investment and would be more reliable, when he heard of the amazing selling machine. The amazing selling machine or the ASM is an Internet marketing programme that operates on amazon. Priced at $4997, it is relatively more expensive than other such online marketing programmes, however it promises a great return on investment, as has been Nick’s personal experience as well as that of several users as seen in their Facebook reviews of the programme. Nick examined how the programme compares with other online marketing alternatives and tested its ease of use to discover that this was the best Internet marketing option he had come across. In his opinion, although the cost is relatively high, it is worth it given the high return on investment that the programme brings. His amazing selling machine review is a comprehensive one which takes into account the various facets of the programme, rendering his expert opinion. There is also an amazing selling machine bonus available which would give users the opportunity to be among the exclusive sellers on amazon through various tips tools and resources that Nick has curated himself. The programme provides a 30-day free trial period, allowing users to test the product before they commit to it. The machine will be on sale again in April this year.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 83 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares164 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate.

Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Nope. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ?

You may recall that last year, Google added a warning in the Phone app for when a suspected spam caller was ringing. Now the company is bringing that same feature to Google Voice. According to a post on the Google Voice Help Forum, the new filter catches twice as many spammers, reports 40% more calls correctly as spam, and results in 20% fewer reports from users. Again, this is the same feature that the Phone app on Pixel, Nexus, and Android One devices already have - Google Voice users just get to enjoy it too. You can make sure it's on by enabling spam filtering in the webapp or mobile app. See the link below for the original source.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Earth 8.0 lets you explore the world more By Ida Torres - April 18, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Apparently, almost all people who have opened Google Earth search for their homes the first time they open the app or the web-based version. But while it is a good starting point, it should also be more about exploring the world around us, from the comfort of your chair. The latest version of both the Android app and the web version allows us to do just that but in an easier and more interactive way, allowing us to “connect to something bigger than ourselves”. Version 8.0 has several new features to help you get to know the rest of the world. Voyager is a showcase of interactive guided tours wherein Google teamed up with some non-profit organizations, storytellers, and scientists. There are currently around 50 immersive stories that you can explore, including Natural Treasures from BBC Earth, Gombe National Park with Jane Goodall, and even a stopover in Mexico with Sesame Street’s Lola. More stories are added every week so you probably won’t run out of places to explore. If you just feel like seeing a random place, you can now click on the I’m Feeling Lucky button. it will take you somewhere random and unexpected. You will see a Knowledge Card so you can learn more about the place, including more pictures of it. You can also click on the stack of cards to see other related places. There are more than 20,000 places already curated but Google so start getting lucky now. Google Earth also wants to make it about home and so the This Is Home feature lets you explore various traditional homes around the world so you can see how other people live. And when you’re virtually exploring places in 3D (by clicking the 3D button of course), you can share a postcard of your exact view to your loved ones and they too can jump into that view. The new Google Earth is now available on your Android device and on the web.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Military News Tech Roundup: QCOM Answers Apple, GOOGL Answers DoL, WDC Objects Shutterstock photo Last week saw Qualcomm QCOM filing counterclaims against Apple AAPL in their ongoing patent-related lawsuit, Alphabet GOOGL defending itself against gender inequality allegations by the Labor Department, Western Digital WDC objecting to Toshiba’s chip unit sale to Broadcom AVGO and much more. So let’s jump to the details- Qualcomm Replies to Apple In counterclaims filed in a California Federal court, Qualcomm has indicated that Apple is playing needlessly dirty in an attempt to keep costs down. The point of contention, as has often been in the past, is standard essential patents (SEPs), on the basis of which much of modern day telecommunications takes place. The companies that contributed technology to form the standard are required to license the technology to others on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. But what constitutes FRAND has been debated about a lot because companies offering this technology obviously want to be paid more, especially from companies like Apple that make super normal profits. While on the other hand, the companies that license want to point to all their other innovations built on top of the standards and argue that the standards are just a very small part of the end product and so don’t deserve a good price.  Qualcomm’s complaints are mainly about Apple failing to engage in good faith negotiations over its 3G and 4G patents while also seeking to use both these and its 5G technology at a fraction of the cost that other smartphone vendors are apparently willing to pay. „Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well-established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm” reads the complaint. It also says that Apple made „false statements” to the Korean FTC and encouraged Samsung to go after it to force Qualcomm to change its licensing model. The KFTC investigation ultimately led to an $865 million fine on Qualcomm. Note that Apple doesn’t use Qualcomm technology directly but through its manufacturing partners, which have licensing deals with Qualcomm, some going back to before Apple started using its technology. If Apple withholds payments to its partners they might hold out on payments to Qualcomm. Qualcomm may be able to get its agreements enforced in court but it leads to unnecessary and wasteful litigation on multiple levels. This is exactly what Apple is doing according to Qualcomm. Qualcomm further says that Apple „acted to prevent Qualcomm from revealing to consumers the extent to which iPhones with Qualcomm’s chipsets outperformed iPhones with Intel’s chipsets” and later falsely claimed that there was „no discernible difference.” Google’s Fight with the Labor Department The U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) has made a sweeping statement that it had „found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce” and DOL Regional Director Janette Wipper said the agency had received „compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.” In a detailed response to the allegation, Google’s VP of people operations, Eileen Naughton said that the claims had been made „without any supporting data or methodology.” She also explained the salary analysis system Google currently employs: „Each year, we suggest an amount for every employee’s new compensation (consisting of base salary, bonus and equity) based on role, job level, job location as well as current and recent performance ratings…The analysts who calculate the suggested amounts do not have access to employees’ gender data. An employee’s manager has limited discretion to adjust the suggested amount, providing they cite a legitimate adjustment rationale.” The model then measures individual salary calculations against those received by their peers which is done to eliminate „statistically significant differences between men’s and women’s compensation”. Naughton also said that Google’s methodology is available to other businesses if they want to test their own compensation practices for equal pay. This has been going on since Sep 2016, after which a case was filed in January, asking for its compensation data. Things came to a head after Google failed to comply with a routine audit. Western Digital Objects Toshiba is under pressure to sell its memory chip business after accounting irregularities related to its Westinghouse nuclear project put it into financial trouble. But Western Digital, which recently acquired SanDisk, is in a JV with Toshiba and has also invested billions of dollars in that business. WDC says that Toshiba didn’t have the legal right to split the chip business and it also deserves prior and confidential negotiating rights in case of its sale as a result of this agreement. It also objects to a sale to Broadcom, despite it being the highest bidder because of unsavory dealings with that company.

This was the 10 th straight quarter of PC shipment declines. Business PCs did better than consumer PCs as expected. The spoilers remain largely the same: shift to mobile devices and emerging markets, and a longer replacement cycle.

The BIS reportedly says that this phone will be different from international versions. Apple recently discounted the 4-inch phone to Rs. 19,999, which is expected to help it gain share in the mid-range market. Wistron-owned ICT Service Management Solutions, based in Yeshwantpur, Benguluru has been commissioned for the manufacturing. MKM Optimistic on Alibaba Cloud Growth : MKM analysts have issued a highly optimistic report about Alibaba’s BABA cloud business. They estimate that the business could be worth $20 billion today with the potential to grow to a $65-70 billion valuation over the next 4-5 years. The optimism is driven by data supplied by the analysts: 60K developers are working on the platform, AliCloud has 765K paying customers (up 100% year over year), it has 2.8 million total customers; after large enterprises, which use state-owned infrastructure, AliCloud is the largest private player with 70 of the largest 100 startups using its services. Also, Alibaba has been investing in the business for the past eight years, which is reportedly three years short of Amazon and four years longer than Alphabet’s Google. New Technology/Products AMD Ryzen 5 Release : AMD started selling its Zen-based Ryzen 5 processors (four core/eight thread and six core/twelve thread) into the channel some time back and now, these products are available to consumers. The processors reportedly compare well with Intel’s Kaby Lake-based i5 chips (four core/four thread) going by the considerable number of reviews comparing the two. As may be expected, Intel’s chip is more expensive when you consider the fact that it has fewer threads and cores, but single-core performance is better. On a net basis, while AMD still lags Intel slightly on performance, it’s packing in more compute power at lower costs that is likely to go down well with consumers. Gamers are the biggest drivers of consumer PC sales right now so both Intel and AMD have their work cut out.  Microsoft Tools for Hybrid Cloud Migration : Microsoft MSFT has come out with three new tools that in very broad terms, will help enterprises evaluate the savings generated from moving corporate workloads to Azure, the Azure Hybrid Use Benefit in the Azure Management Portal that can save them up to 40% on their Windows server licenses and Azure Site Recovery to facilitate the process of migrating virtual machines to Azure. Microsoft is en route to delivering annualized commercial cloud revenue of $20 billion by 2018 and its pace of growth indicates that the once unreal target is now within reach. Microsoft Launching Minecraft Marketplace : The Minecraft development team apparently can’t keep up with the demand for customizations and levels and so it’s getting on board independent developers that will supply these and other customizations through the in-game store. The good thing for developers is that Minecraft maker Mojang, now owned by Microsoft is willing to pay out 50% of what the creation generates, with 30% going to Apple, Google, or Microsoft’s app stores and itself retaining the rest. Minecraft is an insanely popular title, having sold 121 million copies worldwide, with 55 million unique monthly players (figures from Microsoft). As of now, nine businesses have been approved for selling feature packs with prices ranging from $1-10 per creation. Microsoft will sell Minecraft Coins that can be used to buy items.  Microsoft intends to eventually make the purchases sync across devices and platforms. Microsoft Ends Support for Vista : Microsoft has officially withdrawn support to its unsuccessful Windows Vista launched in 2009. While some people did buy systems based on the OS, most were dissatisfied and what’s more, Vista was the reason that most XP users simply refused to move on. All that is well behind us and both Windows 7 and Windows 10 have been received well. Microsoft says, Windows Vista users „will no longer receive new security updates, non-security hotfixes, free or paid assisted support options, or online technical content updates from Microsoft.” So that ends the matter. Google Home Services, Food Delivery App for India : Google has launched an app called Aero in Bengaluru and Mumbai, India that will allow people to connect with home service providers like plumbers, electricians and the like. It will also allow users to search for nearby restaurants and schedule food delivery. M&A and Collaborations Microsoft, eBay, Tencent Invest in India’s Flipkart : Microsoft, eBay and China’s Tencent joined earlier investors Naspers Group, Tiger Global Management, Accel Partners and DST Global for a share in Flipkart, India’s largest ecommerce company. The three companies together invested $1.4 billion. Ebay sold its Indian operations to Flipkart and added $500 million for its share in the company. The company is now valued at $11.6 billion. Microsoft Buys Deis : Microsoft spent an undisclosed amount of money to buy San Francisco-based software startup Deis that was reportedly acquired by Engine Yard back in 2015. The startup has developed an open source tool based on the Kubernetes container management system that Google developed and then open sourced. Microsoft initially agreed to work with Google on Kubernetes back in 2014 but also backed competing platforms Mesos and Docker Swarm. But Kubernetes has gained ground so in February, Kubernetes became available on the Azure Container service as well. The reason this is all so significant is because containerization is extremely important for information stored in the cloud since it creates a virtual box of code that can be shared and moved between applications and across clouds as needed. „At Microsoft, we’ve seen explosive growth in both interest and deployment of containerized workloads on Azure, and we’re committed to ensuring Azure is the best place to run them,” Scott Guthrie, EVP cloud and enterprise group at Microsoft wrote in a blog post. Google to Invest In LG Display : South Korea’s Electronic Times has reported that Google has offered to pay LG Display up to $880 million (one trillion KRW) as its contribution toward a production line for flexible OLED panels for use in second-generation Pixel phones. LG is considering the offer. Google’s Pixel, which has the appearance and features of a premium device and has been marketed as such, will fall back in the race with Samsung and Apple on features if it doesn’t get some OLED screens of its own. So Google’s needs are clear: it also doesn’t need to get into a deal with Samsung, which uses OLED in its own phones and is also in an agreement to supply to Apple. So it’s trying to find another supplier.  Some Numbers Facebook Announces Monthly Advertisers : Facebook FB has announced that the number of advertisers on its platform has grown from 4 million to 5 million between September and now. Businesses with mobile pages now total 65 million while businesses with Instagram profiles are up to 8 million. Among the 5 million advertisers, the biggest industries are e-commerce, entertainment/media and retail. Unsurprisingly, around 75% percent of advertisers are in its fastest-growing markets, which are India, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Nearly 50% of advertisers create ads on mobile devices. Facebook Messenger Users : Facebook Messenger, which the company spun out in 2014 and then enhanced with games, a chat bot platform, voice calling, video calling, as well as a revamped camera with masks, frames, stickers and effects now has 1.2 million users. That’s up from 700 million users when it was spun out and 600 million users on the hot Facebook-owned platform Instagram. Sell These Stocks.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research.

The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year.

Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Nope. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ?

But just because it's a hotspot doesn't mean the rules of data uses don't apply. You'll still want to keep data usage down to a minimum. Here's how you can enjoy all the perks of a mobile hotspot without wrecking your wallet. Image: Gizmodo Saving data in your browser Image: Google Chrome has a Data Saver extension made by Google that cuts down on page loading times by rerouting the sites you visit through Google's servers, and compressing them along the way. If you trust Google with this kind of data (HTTPS pages and pages launched in incognito mode aren't included) then it's a quick and simple data saving trick. This add-on gives you the same feature in Firefox, though it's an unofficial implementation of Google's Chrome extension and isn't made by Google itself. Alternatively you might want to install Opera instead, it has this kind of functionality built in (look for the Opera Turbo option) — again only non-HTTPS sites are processed, so your most sensitive data isn't intercepted. Image: Screenshot Meanwhile, turning off the automatic loading of images makes your browsing experience a lot less interesting, but it's going to save you a whole heap of data too. In Chrome's Settings pane, go to Show advanced settings then Content settings to disable automatic image loading; in Firefox, the same option is on the about:config page — change the permissions.default.image value to 2. Alternatively, get a browser extension to do the job for you. We've talked in the past about stopping videos from auto-playing, and this advice still applies if you're wanting to save data on a tethered connection, though many sites will adapt their output accordingly if they detect you're on a limited connection. Saving data in other apps Image: Screenshot As far as applications outside your browser, the best way of saving data while tethering is to cache all your music and movies on your laptop beforehand, while you're still attached to some solid wi-fi. If that's not an option though, you can still make changes while you're out and about. Netflix should adjust your streaming speed automatically to match your connection, but setting this manually will lower quality and data sucked down. Choose Your Account from the menu under your avatar, then click Playback settings and select Low. In the settings page for the Spotify desktop client, meanwhile, you'll see a High quality streaming toggle switch, so make sure this is off while tethering. Image: Screenshot We can't cover every application you might have installed but if you poke around in the settings for your programs you might be able to find similar options. It's also a good idea to hit the pause button on syncing services like Dropbox and Google Drive if it's practical to do so (you can do this from the system tray or menu bar icons). You also want to put automatic downloads and app installations on hold while you're tethering, and there are changes you can make at the OS level too. Launch the Settings app in Windows 10, click WiFi then your network, and you can toggle the Metered connection switch: this tells installed apps you're on a limited connection, and puts a halt to large OS updates at the same time. Image: Screenshot There's no such option on macOS, but there is TripMode, which works on Mac and Windows computers. The app lets you set which programs can use data and which can't, so you get much finer control over how much data is getting pulled over your tethered connection, and you can get detailed usage breakdowns as well. TripMode costs $US7.99 ($11) but there is a free trial available. Beyond these tricks the most important thing to do is apply some common sense when it comes to the apps you're using and how you use them (keep those browser tabs down to a minimum), but the tips above should get you well on your way to saving a ton of data while you're tethered. As an added bonus, you should save some battery life too. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Be the first to comment on this story! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Be the first to comment on this story!

Samsung Galaxy S8: Australian Review Campbell Simpson 19 Apr 2017 11:00 AM The Samsung Galaxy S8 is Samsung's first big phone launch after last year's Note7 disaster. It's a huge moment for the world's most popular smartphone manufacturer. For a lot of everyday smartphone buyers -- the talkback radio listeners and tabloid newspaper readers of the world -- Samsung is a tarnished name. The Galaxy S8 is the first, and potentially only, chance for the company to change that opinion. Thankfully, the Galaxy S8 and plus-sized S8+ are absolutely brilliant smartphones. They're not without their flaws, but in everything from industrial design to internal hardware to software refinement, Samsung has knocked this one out of the park. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

If the door to. Martinez. Is the door to Martinez which cheek if the door. Monty. If that's my dorm blob cache. Banks are turning into another episode of hash tagged or my name's rich keep joined once again by Ryan Davey Davey how were you. Great Oreo. I I'm really strong extra things that are on strike target I'm having a pretty strong day anyone know why that is is because this is the 100 episode Astec dork. It was this seemed like only yesterday. You know I mean. It really does a depleted our link. Was up on YouTube of the first ever dork podcasts like a year two years ago or ever was. And it was like forty minutes it was just you and me you were on. Against I would call it not a land line. And not belt America they did in a I was in my car. He's fifth the fifth sounded like you may have been in a car. What we've banged out when he solid minutes on marble villains and that was the beginning of this this wonderful pot. And I remember the guy is the idea sprung from your head. Me being like hey. I know podcast exists but I I know they exist but I did not really sure what they are. End. Mike powers enabling you mean it just didn't really occur to me that you know hundred we'd be hundred episodes into the. Yeah how it the first one was we literally just ordered up on YouTube which is not really the ideal place to that this didn't listen to select that long out I wasn't sure how. How iTunes worked I was somebody that I was just I think we're so green. And both of I've got to organ or even now on nod WEEI dot com it's a visible for those who have just joined us on WEEI dot com first of all thank you. Second of all you understand how the houses there 100 episode where actually the tenth episode. Well Davey and I've into the podcast for a long time in fact we did nine the episodes for the merger took place at WEEI. It was their ideas to restart the number count which makes a lot of sense and I get it you don't wanna just jump in the somewhere in the eighties so we jumped in at number one. But in my in my personal counter. This is number 100 so let's both cleared out but. It so now we start explaining about you know how model works with Eric 616 in different dimensions yeah universe is. It's all very confusing. If you now overdue in the suburbs those were answer some questions that launch an email questions from listeners and Twitter questions as well. But I still refers to our our our normal opening several what do you think about it. RI and we had a Star Wars the last gen eight trailer. What does that phenomenal they looked great common and some of that media today it would they are saying will be in acceding to Google isn't that cool and might well. It yet about time that a movie trailer came up that they didn't give too much weight too soon. I agree that because there wasn't really a ton going on. But they didn't need to and they knew they didn't need to so why spoil the movie like you would just give us that just gives a taste I'm calling me it was a snippet. But that's the root of the world's greatest trailer. But so many including your voice Spiderman and there they can overdo it in they give you may be a little too much. Look at what do we do which is which Islam we live in we live in an age now where trailers have trailers yes so it was nice to see something. Be like a wet DeWitt to speak a little bit and not give too much away. Now bottom there was there was some good dialogue in it and I'm I wanna read the dialogue IE I yacht transcribed it against the biographer what do. Sure there are so this is again of the trailers like two minutes or less than two minutes there was a bit of a pay back and forth. Now wanna read it's you and and I want your opinion on on what it means apparent. Look quote breathe. Just breathe now reach out what are you see. Ray light. Darkness the balance. Luke it's so much bigger I only know one truth it's time for the Jett died. And and seen. What do they. It seems as though in the beginning that grade and Luke are doing some sort of mindful that exercise. Yes they're trying to be more present in their daily lives and so they're working on breathing and community being in the moment. Yelled. Body toy it's not so much killed president just you know breathing and dust like meditation the committed meditative practice. Don't they are ours and she like our ancestry and. Let's hope not as old boy alone and don't let it sit and think deviated. I think there's some sort of training going on. Which. Obviously mean that yes your ear training little light Saber in you know but I think. Editor of people what did you Wear to regenerate it and and I'd thought about this critically met Luc is the lat. Jeddah he's the last one. So. Well but then there is right that while they said this guy and it is the world is the last tonight. Which is well laurel so you multiple generalize. But it stands right now yet but as of as far as we know those are you know that yeah remaining I believe that's correct yeah so. Why train her if he wants all eight people to. Ceased to exist is so maybe you look it they're looking to start the new jet order which in the books Luke does. So here's our here's our side is that he wants the jet guy to sort of change because clearly that's not the right way to do things. This is not just my opinion because she says she sees light and she sees darkness and then that the bounce I think Luke's saying. Are it's kind of (%expletive) to be just light. Or just darkness and I'll probably lose to many people that darkness is because we're here in the light Hawkeye you can't get follow Mladic dance where'd you can't drink soda in nearly all the stuff. It so that's not gonna work so the it needs to be more gray but it needs to be you can't be complete dark side bigger or you know embracing the darkness. But there you see more of that land the between the two and that's what's gonna succeed so. He's not saying. I think like the jet I have to and or called something different where we can we change the rules the world X I've seen too many many good men and women lost and that's I think you said. Maybe you know he tries to pull you know. He tried to pull them back. Yeah it won't tolerant because try to pull back. And then you know I mean you lost them lets them that's their wife and I think that was the you can't work with the trees now if you will that's why is. Other that tries other. And abandoned. The other jet and many eventually solve the error of his ways to be honest it was too late. It was too late facility can't save each it is Novo back but in the book there are effective Jeddah called the great Jett died the day ago that's a we need to. But that's what we need and you know we need where the focus is not light and dark the focus is now. Balance in keeping spear bounced did you see the post there. What did you think and have a looks like she's maybe hold onto all red sabre which is of course we know just persists. All taking you know that the the jury's still out utter you know what is she all about. Where she comes from there mr. We don't know now Lance getting MS this before but just her for people joining us. Do you want her. To be related to you like Obi wan aura skywalker or somewhere like that or would you prefer her to be like her own thing. They have to be some sort of tie there I don't know it needs to be electric huge character you don't believe somebody would recognize. You know I mean but I would that would be. The Mon my rock. Yes some somebody. Jango jingles that now which somebody though so you want to know what you want a connection you don't want I wanna connection. Yet she had that bit it is people have vested interest in her you know some notes with kilometer about Darth Maul. She oh yes bring him back into the books by her body now it feels utterly. I know you guys back I didn't I haven't read that Japanese here he's back. His deal was that that's all. Hope. I am the public attitudes base or was that was just. Us that we. Yeah they would get double convention. Though little overboard he's the body modifications one hornets time attempt at a musings that painful process and I'm gonna be intimidating and. Did it at the Star Wars celebration thing in Orlando they had like they brought out rape park collect. Get some award or something of that nobody really knew who he was the first time. That's that you like that that's the guy who was towed in the first acts that moves I may have got there it. Yeah it been like eight movie it is I think he's said Blake to line. Yeah I saw these. Talker but that doesn't mean he's that you can't do it in other ways I think he's also going to be had come upon and foxwoods. All kinds of her back and we're gonna. Turn back from that. I think maybe next markets in June and so we are here by may and I'm guessing there's their tallest no thanks. All over them myself and knock on their tornado meal and a viral are you really thought ought not now and I think I've spent maybe collectively 400 dollar in the casino in my life and it. It was gone in a blink of an act too predictable Lansdale. God sixty seconds yeah do you buy or VC. They shut out that it is is gonna all the movies that he was then I'm. Thought here now he's got one of the better shows on TV or not really TV but Amazon prime at a show in can't speak EP. Are you really don't I'll. Sneaky she's good at night a whole lot rank president well we're up a real eyeball to eyeball thirty Kia wants everything on the search at the Los that. The deals are worse. I'm very excited to see it didn't see it in there it'll be good and Christmas. And you're a little bit David Lido where we haven't taken here we're excited that you are yet to break. We're all the or it's madness just yet so that's fine we'll move on and we'll look cool jet Oca Aaron that'll backed down. Argue casting news. Guy abode Josh Roland as cable and did pull to. Which is awesome little people violate his name of it brought up in the Google search talk about Brad Pitt are the guys from avatar is it might never member but. Remember thinking like a dog that might be just pro until my death equaled that they can't do that. You get beat to marvel properties that doesn't make any sense. Streaked and sure sure sure I can watch it now Moala at first I was like I don't know how is going to be but the more I think about it I think I think he's actually great now I. I didn't want Michael Shannon. I didn't want the user Brad Pitt I didn't watch I would heated Brad Pitt is a lot of really good movies on it too weird. Yeah you like cable Gilligan little more. We bring forward yet exactly. He's everything you know. I did see it up just rolled it usually good news those strong and although woes is named in them and well and well. Lou Allen. Seems more like Ithaca boy and in suits that territory. Well grow up at that point in Llewellyn yeah and so tough draws cable we both like that. About Doug James Dillon it was announced this both write and direct guardians of the galaxy volume three. In what would yet because I'm hearing directly at them up today at an all over the place that that they they actually. Put out the reviews from the people that the focus groups who sought out the if you look all bananas. There's simply degraded the best movie BMC yeah. It is leadership tonne of closing. Scenes like penetrate or five. At five Arabs stay in his seat utility you know that's how when approached I saw the lights go on the guy comes out with a sweeper he says art now like idiotic. We get some bad news older couple of good news departments have a one on the bad news department Nintendo. Announced they're discontinuing the many Annie asks. Yeah I sit in this is one of those things where eight U. How you do this what do you mean you put up this thing that everybody wants an image that we can't keep up with it and it's kind of was like a caught they don't get caught them they they can't afford. To put them out as some like Ellis it's crap you wrote it used. And they want people to by the switch obviously I think the I think one of the big things is so it if you Seles which. There's still more money to be made his people around by teams of people around by the other add on things like that or is this Nintendo you sell one of these. India may be sold few bonus controllers for the and that's it. I think it's crap but I still don't know how you can't afford to make those interview raised the price a little bit insists sent them out and had him available stores. They're gets snapped up its auto I really don't get this and now all the hassles that already own armor selling conflict even more and they've really has our government at the. Yeah I'd blatantly play where kids. A brand new details secret right now well ya got a computer in a US army accidentally maybe aren't your phone right now so article some called emulation. Where you can just tell you going to be. The fifteen bucks second on Amazon and get a retro Nintendo controller USB thing in just played among my computer. Yeah out we did it all AS employed up play how to do yet GM Jim boy at our Vaughn the you gotta get to that does this that's a little bit of passed this week and hash tag dork. Now for the last couple of weeks black panther has joined us at the end of the podcast. And he has told us what we thought were spoilers of the black panther movie. It sounded like all usually talking about was the that the movie coming to America. Impotency there be a sequel to come into America was I didn't think sounded right turns outs are a bit his rights. And there is this idea coming to America's sequel I guess the guy who wrote the first one is gonna write this on. This come from. Joking don't you noted. Coming to America to what's the what's the premise of this movie. Was the plot synopsis you ought to not let it. Okay all right it's. You didn't have a big on the work that out yes on the demand that we implement them keep them yet. As well as welcomed the against the gets passed on from generation to generation. Well connect every registered I do like this public. So bizarre. I couldn't blue eyes if you didn't mean it's instantly apparently but there's still the truth about. They're going Hollywood are out by the over there a little boy realized law. That's that's pretty. I think you think there McDowell in the Monday it now yes it merited it at that flick their big chain has McDowell I would think so. They have to golden arches vehicle and parks. The other hole there all over the place. They're the future now lastly we talked about mystery science theater 3000 but the overturned their they're kind of rebooting the thing. And it's on Netflix. I didn't I didn't I don't wash the time of it yet I started it it seems promising no way I like we want to they're all very likable. You have been here all over the left overs are now can we do hear about that. Oh and smokes the leftovers. Man. This isn't on my favorite shows of all time and it was the season three premiere this past week. And I'd love it I absolutely so Terry Cooney actress who who plays and Norah in the show she is also coming up currencies and Fargo. I think she. Is my favorite television series. Female character. Ever really yeah really. It does look there's it's it's there's a lot of back story there you go back and watch the show. Is a very well developing she's a great actors on top of the put the care there there's there's a lot going on there. And I like her more than anybody else. In the show's good there's I mean whatever shows a couple of characters you don't like as much by the the strong characters in this are off the charts I'm fascinated to see how. What they're gonna do how it's gonna and maybe everybody dies may be some BellSouth I don't know but I I am I can't wait for. All I need to put it appears you need it yet get an active and not at all deep and it yet. Oh no it's your balls the appearance and has done. Also analogy if our viewer caught up or not but I will say this rate bounced back episode better call Saul. Episode two of the season very strong really I mean unity you knew that was coming right down announced had to go to it yet they don't get a little bit. And. You know. Either man. I already at this week grind into. I guess people here I created a TV up you know I like that like a good pace on a good pace the podcast and only people flawlessly period we don't roll. Yeah we definitely do it some blame as week one of them speaking to guard into the galaxy telltale series put up their first episode of the guardian of the galaxy game old sit at the yeah he could get that right quick that that came out today it is currently downloading on my PlayStation which I'm staring at right now secondly. Commandeered a game that I started playing big ball deep that it says are playing this week that I was really hesitant to. Start playing discuss the way it looked. And then back automatic critics Florida's that are sold. I think it's currently sitting in at ninety or 93. On meta critic right now in the game called persona 50. Tom which is a bit of a role playing game but it is very Japanese. Nice so you who is like the cut scenes are all like anime games you are alike the Qatar street popped high school kid. Early got that far into it but it good so it period like Google Final Fantasy games but that in Mike late Tokyo earlier high school. Bit high school kids you know just you know mixes it up scrap them you know this this is something that probably going to be pretty good once they get older more into it other him to elect an hour to. It sounds pretty good stuff forget. Our Susan what else they did so we last week we took to Twitter and we say you could tweet us questions you can emails questions. And has some more coming and I stumbled upon this idea you know if you meet somebody. That sort claims to be a dork or the caller I'm interest in this sort of like. You have certain if certain questions that you probably wanna ask you see well you know where that person is or just how you know similar you may be to this person. I was thinking we need an official hash tag door questioner. Nice and so these are some of the questions that bottom we can always add to this later. And then I thought for us is to be a good way the server the Rome and then give our quick answer to people to sort of see where we are as a relates to these things. Apparent but art first thing if you talk to somebody who claims to be a a bit of a dork like I was doing down at the Super Bowl asking the likes of match job I would say. Who was your fair superhero. Right at pretty straightforward and of course if your match obviously don't have one because Anwar. Just the wreck of a guy apparently her height and in superhero along would you please sir. Yet I'll get some playing a lot about my. I think it it's been part of this this podcast for sometime but my growing up then. Continues to be my favorite superhero in the moral universe was that would always Spiderman now. From a very very young age and people ask me why and I don't hide out at big everytime I act. It got that question. I say something different but they've the answer is it's always just been part twilight. You know being like two years old and I think my mom got me Micah. Ski mask that was like Alec that old school ski mask yeah yeah I would read it was like it up like Spiderman. They probably banked it knows that everyone. Tea it was still look like Spiderman and values to like climb trees in my backyard get stuck in an amount could get me. So it's minor and yet it is glad experiment the top. By Chris did you Letterman's mom was dead so that's not exactly class Byron Meyer for the longest time it was ice man but I feel like. He doesn't really evolves and awfully that was there's so many good comics are so many good shows us some good things that they don't use him very well. So we have got all. That well. Wait where is he gay and I'll get into and accommodate historic though I didn't I didn't read it. Look at it it it took so this is gonna is gonna sound really bad but he's not on their character anymore and it's. It's not that I thought it's not because of that that's a terrible as the front distaste about their character so not a not a bit on what of course not I don't I don't care about that. But I felt yeah I don't I enjoy the program Mya and my spirit is red hood. I am I I absolutely love the red hood he is my more recent. Favorite character. Hence why you know back and then my Xbox-360. Handel was iceman something and now it's red hood something so at. And it it'd fits your personality and a bit of a fiery. Bit of a fiery guy. I can run hotter at times sure you can so Chile soccer I leg. Red hood off they were super villain. I ain't. Have always been a man. The Joker obviously yet that I have been a champion of all. Villains I mean I think what they've done that what. At one point in the economic fifties and sixties it was a good throw away Carriker. Yeah now become like kind of the gold standard. Out thanks to you know people like Alan Moore and you know people who have and it changed. And Frank Miller who have. You know they've taken a stupid idea and ran with it did its. One more complex. Ones that are the villain that I think yeah Serb and what the paper. It's the best and I usually try not to pick. Favorites whether it's athletes or you know I'll put characters are never that are like everybody's favorite but I don't like doing that but this is one worry I can't over think it went the Joker. To oversee us. Another question would be favored graphic novel or favor comic book series you know that depending on what's. People realize. My favorite graphic novels of all time was the crow was the first graphic novel ever read a lot pro. And ultra violent had to go to the twelve or thirteen and erratic round of the movie came out very inappropriate for young people sore. If you're young kid that read that stuff and then earlier in my life you know early twenties and someone. Maybe sit down and read watchman at a time forever glad they did because that was kind of a game changer for. Bershard and then in turn this series right now my favorite comic book series right now is American vampire. Yes love that which is yet unbelievable so pick that up pressure. Our mind would be a big bat man the long Halloween is my favorites. Graphic novel ever written I mean it was a series at the time goes like thirteen or fourteen issues in the slop altogether so that's that'd be answered to that. Another question you would ask to be favorite movie. Now this is one where this can probably change a lot. But this summer gas see you need to be ready to to answer. It'd be irritating answered and they get so mad that you would win you don't. Because without all I had to back quest of a question about what Jaaber. Isolated. That's a good question because it let him let's break it down this way you're having a conversation with another door person is being elected me your your favorite movie. Your favorite comic book movie your favorite horror movie. In your favor comedy. Let's. Well ordeal and yeah. My favorite movie is I always with these and this one and it is my favorite like I think seven samurai is my very favorite like movie from. Like pop that's a great movie. You know and I mean yeah but nobody can guard the pick out other people would say the godfather here like you can't argue that this is a bad movie goodfellas. But my guess sit down and watched all four hours is seven samurai every day manipulate what's in a movie now not the united means so I think. The foot by a critically my favorite movie personally. From my favorite movie of all time and you know mr. Beecher Richard is this is Spinal Tap. Yes just by it'd be sheer volume of time that watched that DeLeon. You know I love that. Yet our count the movie and more movies. Comic book movie my favorite comic book movie. Is probably the Dark Knight yeah. For obvious reasons that and I would put it so what made Dark Knight one B Spiderman two the same rainy one yes. And Spiderman. Very serious talk about a thousand awesome movie a little bit. My favorite horror movie is evil dead two and and Mozilla. Comedy although you can probably just the Spinal Tap there and they're all fighting going comedy elbow a bit about as well to a guy parent and they located favorite governor at a category favorite laureate movie that you love. That everyone else thinks is like. Really dumb. Like you fit Dominick goes. Roadhouse for that. A road house with him on. The Burmese for that one although more more people specially. Friends of mine really like my Gruber on the Gruber is sort of viewed by a lot of people's Democrat but I loved Gruber who grew rebellions in there. My favorite comedy I was asked this the other day and I'm really hard time this one but it's probably old school. Do you think there's a lot of really good ones and go back to like you know dumb and dumber ace return and Tommy Boy or wherever else but I anchor man's greatest so many heroes but I'll I'll just say old school they were comic book movie is. The Dark Knight but ball pretty closely by the vet by guardians of the galaxy. I come. They were horrible me is either scream or the original Halloween. In my favorite movie which people using every crap for much their movie snatch. Yeah I like argued to keep it that the public know what that have happened good movie. You put up the movies that did not vote that. That we would say it every answer prisoner it's my favorite movie though so stick you know. It's the can appear households without. Cops also let's go to favorite TV show and I think you basically go like sitcom comedy show or regular show. OK so my favorite. Comedy show of all time com is the office. Nice oh oh British British or American. Tom. Imitate my answer okay fine I'll Google and it always sunny in Philadelphia who entered. There's a good out clean and open post American. The American Sonny. I love Sonny I would I would still puts on felt number one for me still lives on as to what values they were regular show. And answer I want over the wire. A couple of other questions I have peer super power you'd most want. I would either one way into this two days and again this question we have amassed I don't know how many times. It's really hard the apparent at 140. Yet tell porters are the top my lest although I wonder how all. What would you be able to do it a sneaky tell Porter or you have to do the parent I'm almost superhero now Liggett pure if you're tell. Don't know all you don't let picketed in this is a terrible movie but the movie jumper. That's. But it can be just like Hayden Christensen in jumper. You merry go equity like you might look at a picture and click go there yeah that's neat you have that that would be what I would do. I held out like not like you know night crawler we can only go like too great and CD can't do a blind. Yes. Or no like stock and wall to make that noise and he likes what he's thick smoke everywhere like that. Which sits everywhere that's like would you knock it off the help or they're arguably a greater go from here to the to the bathroom like the real are back I think. On the one hand like to be able to read somebody's mind like Mel Gibson and wanna girl or woman wants. Putts. How would be bad because he realized just how much everybody that hates you. I don't like what if you like couldn't turn it off as bright as they eagle do you go insane and then yet. Yeah you do that while nobody nobody really likes me is what you get up a big coming away would. The other what I want to do it this Zack Morris timeout and say about it well yeah that's really can you say timeout and whatever country it is. Like that particular talent wolverines duly did you all doubt also be pretty odd like you were just you know. You could run this podcast for like 300 years imagine that. You yeah I don't want that it would be like all these little Walking Dead and. You have until there all that showed the media. That is a lot as a slog. And loud as the superpower I'd I still don't know the answer may aren't a big slash BP B yeah they just that fast. I don't know. It I think that's a real doozy because with the you know great power comes great responsibility Ryan. Yeah I heard that it critical issue appointment I just you open up. If you're over that. Sorrow I have an answer to our favorite old school in new school video game this is written around. OK so new school but current consoles when I'm thinking of new school. Yeah this one or maybe even like the last look if you really got there yes the re humorous pre sixty units on him. Bert my favorite old school video game is probably mega man two yeah we agree with the on the Wii U we agree on that or Contra of culture has been. But they commit to pressure and my favorite news cool video game com. They're both from the same company bit of an I have to lean towards the last of us. Is my day yeah that's a good one I will go with Marcum won the arc and games but at all yeah on candidates impetus yep okay. Technology have I want it it. On the vast. It also got to wrap up there at the door questionnaire these are these are simple ones. Star Wars or Star Trek which although I feel like there are less and less than last Star Trek people now. But there are pretty. I would say it a hundred episode I can finally come clean and they would look we we adore podcast I'm speaking for you Richard. Have not really given Star Trek it's due and to be. Big Star Trek fans but we we got David we respect you when we meet the opposite he worked. But for you if you like it sir you are a million we can't watch everything though. Yet well and I know they're readily available but I I've watched a hole a good amount of Star Trek and it. It's here if you what you get past the camping and it's not that good. But the original start. Carlos and I are now your kind take an attorney he just said hey everybody really like you and we acknowledge you've been here a while kind of sucks though so that's why don't like out. Feel like the hard core Star Trek fans alike gathered the original were decent but yeah the next generation in the rest of armor we're at that. You know if it. That's on the milk the last won't be Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. The chemical and her partner. Are talking about some long slog as The Lord of the Rings may have about past time. Yeah like they had nutshell Mort or two and a new game that's coming out that was awesome. They get an idea that's fair I'm looking more movies. And Heidi the Harry Potter or is it more of them so it's. Although if you have hobbled movies is just that is a hole let the whole thing. Yeah you know it'd do I think a lot of it is for me. The fan base of Lord of the Rings they're like here there quietly confident in in their own bank. Yeah people. People who. Are all about the Harry Potter books and all they do is sit there and bitch about this character about being in this. Diener you have these leaders now they biggest literary you know I don't really care. If whose been who has Perry is girlfriend at one point Chang of the Choo Chiang is open. Mining. All the red that we know the Asian girl well I don't really see that kind of thing. You have your colorblind. My name is Chang. Her. And in my eyes all these other but I don't know like talks slick is league east. Meeting with characters that people get all bent out of shape about the iron. Yes earn hard scenario out of pot that. Yeah I like you your decision chili's not. Chile and. Are well you can always add the UB the listener not you Ryan you know is that. To the hash tag door questionnaire surely. Fine tune this bad boy maybe make it like ten questions to ask our let's get the listener questions wanna start with someone email here. This is from Chris in Quincy. Emails things that hi guys. Great podcast you discuss everything I talk to my friends about on a daily basis I enjoyed listening every week I've suggestion freer hundredth show. Being in my opinion one of the best size 550 shows of all time is there anything game of pro you can talk about. Maybe rate the season's battle scenes your character favorites theories about how it ends. I know that might be a smarter way into the TV show comes back in the summer to talk about but I love the show so much had dementia at feel free to say the suggestion for July. Thanks Chris. You know what Chris. We probably will revisited in July the put up now because it email you wrote I know and also we've had. Shark has been a lot of the game a bronze episodes Davey I know you're also a big fan you have not had a chance on the podcast to talk about it as much. But you know your thoughts on not geo T. I love it and maybe as far as to get your question you know. You know how it then there you go my favorite speed and I think it's one of those things it's gotten better every season. So my ate my Internet as of our. As our god among us Tom Brady says what's your favorite championship video it has an answer to this what's your favorite David drones the series the next. It appears that when I got. I'm just can't wait for them so excited might be solid and but if you haven't watched them knocked that data bank obviously. Yes very good spoiler. But one are we highly recommend he should catch up before the season starts that jump right in ours their characters are concerned. I like much most people are you a stark is Obama Beirut's. Jagan hug gar is we're learning more about him I love. On Dario and Horace politics and the debate. Should in his right yeah allegedly justice you know that. And I made it in the drag them in the dragons there's a lot of good dragon I on the other hand. I'm gold with a thinkers. Oh I really like ferret and I really like here in my minister yeah they're they're they're great. Com. You know the little fact guys. Which you know I really took silver on and on many levels I thought did find out that my exact site is the exact ever tight from and the United States thank you very much. We're gonna let's not DeVito and five I didn't and that's the average man science. In any United States also found out that up Austria has the tallest ever to command which is about 61 lot. The average Bosnian that's why. And the average. Indonesian men its fight to. LaMont. Did you possibly turn at five some nugget. Almost pay you money broad kingdom's political rhetoric but yet mideast issues bing. Even being there and there's still a great search engine problem. I think note not etiquette that music it went out of business is not last time my search for something they weren't. Microsoft distressed out of it we can't you think you wanna we'll then get on the NASDAQ door will push thing. So you have voted their tour event that'll mean oh my god yeah that that's the only good characters. Probably about I enjoyed. All that was awesome that yes. And the thing is what they show the magic of this show is like these are all the good care to what you get so invested in one character because you know it at any moment. They can just go. You know if you haven't what they would reelect these seven or some like that it iguana at this point like you need to get it breaks it. Detail what everything you need to watch it. This is a must watch it it is. Yeah it's it's great I did read the books and I you know shark is read all the books and I know people who read the books and they love the show you know cut equally it if TV if you haven't read the books he can still pick it up but they throw a lot of names that (%expletive) earlier on but don't worry about the third in the comic weird names in weird locations by. You weirdly pick it up rather fast. Are just move on we have him and Chris thanks and you know that's a mortgage or throw stuff certainly has that approaches this is an email. I get dork podcast at gmail.com is the email you can not hit us up with. Jack from South Dartmouth mass says. Really enjoyed the legion podcast just started watching preacher. It was gonna every watched they're double season two but now it's like apple wants a region so thanks keep up the good work it's on the listened to. Also emails you guys earlier and still hoping you'll podcast on recent horror movies like the last five to ten years. Have you guys each give your top ten. Not sure if it's your venue but most comic fans I know also looked good horror flicks grew up both myself and yes. I still love the Walking Dead STV show ever not sure while they hate. That's from Jack. Are we don't really love Walking Dead but that's my jackets it's for different people for different things but the answer is yes we both love. More movies and we've done the last couple of October we don't attack on a more movie stuff. Brigadier to have a top ten the Davie but over the last recent horror movies go to 2002005. On motor coupled that are most wants your. If follows. To create room. Dot org and I must say that I like more. About it note you'll let it till it com. Like yeah I did the one with a blind guy. All like a breeze don't breed it was unbelievable yes. Column the bothered to look Diane your big Bob duke. And also for motivate your mind would be though I I have I'm with the although as I've been seeing green remote has said that although that scene in would definitely say yes to. Also some of the more lake big bug or bigger budget ones on the conjuring a really liked. Us sinners that do sinister like Ethan Hawke that was a scary and insidious. I liked all three of those. You also recommended free which I went and watched us I'm not put all we have got to treat. It. I'm sure missing a couple but there's that between the two officers closed attend those are all really good form a cabinet and what's cabin in the woods. That will it would seem to think if we put the spot what these look like. Could I maybe didn't want to go to this freshman now like comic I got a lot of horrible video what did I have not seen all those ought to get an out in the woods drew guard was awesome. That was set us though a lot of farm is different but our unless they go jackal police some of those. You haven't seen you know and. Acted dispute just to speak to the Walking Dead thing and I'm sorry for talk it over again Richard but their own. I did in the of the reason wild beat for the Walking Dead is because they're really like that show. In the first three or foresees and a super into it I loved it and then I just got bored. You know I mean yeah you're that makes sense I hear your allies need to because I'm just so upset with where it's gone. And I also have an of the sound snob the and I know a lot of people do with movies like now the book is better while. The the show actually got me into the book and that ice I want I read almost all the issues to this point and I I enjoy a the graphic novel more than the shelves now a solid one of those castles like while this is what happened in the book. But that's that's it you're also getting some debate if there's a built in fan base for the show. And then so you don't do things or if you take different choices that's and what people get used to. Here's some two weeks that we got this one is from Roy blocked. He said what ever happened to the wire season five did I miss that. Good question Roy that we did individual episodes. On hash tag dork in the past on each wire season with the exception of number five. And Chris and Jason what happened was we planned on doing it was difficult we try to make him three man possibly had to get everybody's availability. Plus we had we had done for. And then. It was router on the time of the EEI merger and I didn't want more of the first couple of episodes. To be season five of the wire both volatile and kind of random. So we will circle back Roy but thank you. We had a direct message because our GMs are opened and EMs are open. Chris direct message season what do you guys think of he wanted the graphic novel series I have not read it and have you. Yes are the first one on the cure fans of the movie. You are very furry treatment and a complete surprise because they are. Essentially. You know we have a character Wesley who becomes an assassin because in the Atlanta this father was an assassin's bullet the most money. We're kind of the similarities end. It is just it but it also violent alt conceptualize the great art the writing but it it. I really do like get a com. I would recommended to anybody if they said ocean every dispute absolutely obvious not in one of those like you have to read is that you don't like killing joke. I want it meant. Dark return but you don't have to read it but if you're into that movie I would say absolutely pick up its good its its good. It's Mark Miller right. Yeah so. Pretty good. Aaron. We just hash tag dork 100. I hate remakes but if you guys could remake any TV show or movie what would it be. Miner to be the pro. It's still that lags the good news Arab League they are remake of the probe. In this day it's been in development for years yeah that's true and they just can't get it off the ground. I would today. It does have some legs but I think but it said it's one of my favorite graphic novels and it is actually the really good movie. Com. Anywhere our European peace Brantley yet but. Tragic but. I wonder if that the way that move that the book was written in the way that the movie was written and shot if it was like a complete nineties thing. Yeah yeah I like run was doing what ambulance now though I wonder if that I don't know how you would do it again. He said at that time period yet but like you know it was at a very grungy feel to it by the way at one of the my favorite movie soundtracks of all time in the sector but not every nineties band that you would wanna you know you'd wanna mess with our. On that letter from us on Sandra. Thought he would respond it would ever we were very into like we'll get a little bit but we are very much into the rap rock thing yeah like Matt trouble they have like. Israel wasn't a prodigy and Mike you know would have metal band did that. They're good Marilyn Manson song on their the long hard road out of hell holes on spotter believe. Yes it David Crowe contract would put that out what would you re what would you remake if you could anything. I would remakes on yeah does he say number one we stumbled and of that but I would I would remakes on. Brochure. See that's how they went in with a good story book that I feel like this CD to big grip of these visual effects were not where they should be. You go to media entity yet John Leguizamo played cloud again because I thought you made that movie he was used. And at that but that's this year really good answer agreement respond as well our Thursday two weeks from Joseph. I should or 100 dream director and cast spray Justice League movie. Dream villains. He loves god gets the torch route every week this is really difficult I don't have an actor and actress in mind for everybody but first and foremost. I think you need to figure out who would be in said just this week. And Superman Batman Wonder Woman are the three must have obvious ones. And then after that I would add the slash it would be Barry Allen I would add green lantern and probably how Jordan followed that are poor man. And it's. Maher I would like how a tie it up more out of cemetery on them martian man hunter I have green arrow I would have like night wing kind of swooped in here and there. I would. But lack an area like I would I would load that thing out and a lot of that a lot of pro it's a lot of set up a victory I think the villain I think you'd have to have a bunch of different villains like I think you would have. I Ras Al cool I think you could did you bring him back and have him do something knots. You can have. I don't think Lex Luthor is big enough war to get the whole Justice League involvement no. Think he needs to be there to mastermind kind of hold something that yes yeah yeah yeah I agree that. And then I this might be lazy but what he asked for a dream director. I think the Russo Brothers wouldn't you had to can be seen them have the success would avengers. And our there was civil war so. That's a lot of characters thrown into one movie I think they would be pretty good for our Justice League movie. I totally save my dream director only because I know he would never do it. And of two things one I'm with you that if the course re apt to be there might dream casting for that man ready for this payment. Mr. bill. Oh don't SI don't dollar think it. Don't over think it bring him back I would love to see Christopher Nolan directed even though because reckon they know that you never what yeah. You know drew him. M I'll I don't mock I don't. I'm out there would be good movie like he's I can still do a bad one. Yeah that's sure you can take effect in the mid to bat but the Batman movie so realistic instead make an actual world let them know you can do that but the justice. But that many like ridiculous characters are ridiculous and a bad way but just like. In terms of this scope is going to be. Armey you bring him like martian man on third and even green lantern like to do green lantern while all of you know that's another one maybe I'd remake a dud try to find a good way to do out of an actual good green lantern movie. And what if he made about John boy you got from are worse death the very. NATO. What's the ray this isn't a question actually our race says if you could create your own defenders ass series. What four super heroes would you panic. Now let me tell you this this is what my plan would be if you're Netflix. I would I would try to get involved with that man and the bat family. And your four main characters like if you wanna do their own thing you can have that man and have his own season and you'd be like you're you'd be your daredevil he Buick your main guys. Then you can also have odd night wing. You can have been robbed in at this point it would be B Jason Todd Robin would be the second Robin. And you also are not yet not yet but he did get there because you deal could be a long whole thing a lot of setup and then also back girl. It's so those would be like your four main ones but as we all know. Jason Todd dies and eventually becomes the red hood. Back girl gets paralyzed in becomes oracle Damien Wayne is discovered and he becomes Robin or you also Tim Drake and they're so you're. You're just beat the toilet. Is Imus this Newsweek red Red Robin numb. So. Doubt be without your set up and Joker would be your main villain because Joker is. Guess spoiler for books that have been around forever but he's the one of kills Jason Todd and he's the one that puts. Turns back early and oracle so he would be your like your main guy and you just tell these stories. Over all the seasons on Netflix that's I would. I would I would go just this week dark make that a lot of action so I like that that's really do. Yeah yeah content even swap paying and dead man and I thought I doubt would be X series that I would. Die to watch now be sick I was I was let down by the animated movie. OK I give you know exactly who broke out and it was OK is there. Yeah but in broad that a lot elect in the in the spirit of like a daredevil type show you know I mean yes. Are those not yet. And if it let's get to the other portion are different from the boxers both both reached out there and Wes has one question markets has several so let's get to. West as. Harry Potter well he did it and hold trying to answer the best we can but those are the west is question. What is more dork or more hash tag dork liking wrestling or liking board games. More door hash tag dorks yes it like wrestling. Mean more word dork in play key accurate dork or would you play if you play you know worked at. That point. If we we we pride ourselves when we're not nerds here. Where or door and it is those ruled the death. Yet aid that I feel like board games board games not like board like monopoly that like actual games like monopoly. It's Billick bit Richard and I do not know it was a great out we know it man whose claims he has never lost a monopoly. Yes the some. Amongst other beats the business. But you don't love them on the no dude no longer has the monopoly. Monopoly. I'm with the Opel and aggressive little more hash tag dork hence we had her wrestling episodes on the podcast we have not had board you know so. But I think I'd be very that there is a casual audience for. Or wrestling there is no casual audience or hard core board games the interior Jiri in Europe is going to be. Aren't let's get so I yes I agree that Marcus he's innocent email and we can go back and forth on answering machines. I thought that the US so this openness and turn into too much of us sniffing each other parts but this is I think way. But it didn't last as they wanna know this that this is less opinions about characters are more about us which is which. Oslo the first question is how did you guys meet. We went to high school together and military very prestigious. Prep school and saint Paul's and I was a freshman and Davey. Join the school as a sophomore so we're nearly eight or. They repeat sophomore Davey is a great ahead of me is an undisclosed amount of years older than me. And he. We both played football so early on the ball really that's where we met was pre season football. And they don't remember played football and baseball together. I'm David put pocket but gospels that's how that worked. Here's a good question and I wanna get your side in this what's the biggest fight you've ever had into the gets physical. Elephant talk about it Richard well the minute that I ask you know you're wrong. August (%expletive) let's put it to the audience it'll put video entries always tell the story wrong look at some stores a year ago. Richard and died so we were such good friends and I'll go back to beat the previous question we never thought. Never know of the you know I've ever been in my in actual we elect like it into an argument like your stupid and that be the end of it. Humble we'd never actually like fought fought because closest we ever came to fight now know the moment. But to go back to the first question whether we meet the mobile we met each other it was like. We were both by lapping the entire time people thought we were ridiculed and we are stuck together. So Richard I always played catch together on baseball like wee bit tight lipped it every. Normally warm up with somebody the first like him as a practice just playing catch inferred. Two years or three years straight we play catch everything that. Every single day surveyed the argument came up and I am not kidding this is the biggest fight we've ever had was would you rather be really hot. Or really called. Yeah BR if that is 100% the argument. And so this is Meyer a take on what happened is so this got brought up in the world like in the middle. And as we would do a lot of talking on a team they've whoever is warmer up they can all hear us talk. And the coaches randomly weren't there that de Sousa were just on the bezel you'll just the team and Emma would you rather be really really hot or really really cold. And so I said art you're really really hot or really really coal in your wearing like shorts and a teacher. And and Davey says it will no you have to be really really cold in shorts and T shirt or really really hot in like all like a winner out of a ski outfit. In my mind like. If you do that you can't just because that's. Of course that would rather be really hot in just a short shorts and a teacher. Because he's going to be pretty happy even it out. Right up my point was. Who the hell would be really really hot wearing a winner jacket you would take off the winner jacket you'd take off. The jacket. And so we will not unlike the semantics of it we were we were a lot insults our words like can't repeat here. But we were insulting each other like you've never heard beacon assay and his idea of the argument didn't make any sense he say that mind does make any sense. And then the more the argument goes we're donning applaud each other world is it harder hole. Edit finally. Arab there was like best a year shark but somebody had to step and I was like all right like you gold down there Datsyuk didn't think you've got here because they were like air mail the ball or on like on our knees. We don't yet in my air mailed on purpose and it can get get caught. And I was so mad it is it's like Ariel your your so called. Well you can't just create a guy a jacket put down Robin would you would you admit they won by it to admit I need subs do you dance and edit jacket and ultimately the it was so intense eyes and you can't go to college picked it up and take take my jacket not a good argument. Going to be noted and again that and that I would have been a look at shark and a bit like shark. Shark if you really hot endured a Jackie would you take the jacket off and he's like I'm not answer that. I'm not I'm not answered that question. Bella and now at the moment he came over it would have been able would like one out you go play cat with Betsy now I'll look at the report. The thing is yet. Shark by the way is urging us drones expert does he can't throw away the boxing broadcast. Yeah an end in charge it rich have been friends away longer than rich and I have yes sharp comments from her for Bob yet he knew he knew when to step in and what it was good. We'll look to attend. But how dumb is that the that the biggest fight we never been it would hold it didn't come to blows but it almost. On the best is when you explain that to somebody yeah we got to work close up by viewers got on the ball to each other there was yet that was easy but truthfully. Was the biggest Biden gotten into a thug with somebody's ass is up with war and I was like would you rather be really hot really cold and they're like. Ballot bowl will really hot or they do and it's the question I'm likely out without a much that wasn't really a doll like the present and all of that up that there are a lot of it on on the area. Let's see you next question in here why won't Davey stopping lazy and come record review in person rich. This is this is actually good question and we can't do that every now and again but I actually live in Connecticut. We were both raised in New Hampshire but. My job actually took Pete two teaches school in Canada it's likely I live like two and a half hours from Austin that this really isn't a question Liam I'm. Your busy and if you're also father why yet again at that and we've done one podcast that thing together. And you know we'll do more in the we have the northeast how McConnell we will do welcome Tom and though well from there to that's how that's done. Evening there are yet there are plans to do a lot more of those once. What we can't figure out. You know how to work. Yes yet. Our next question has Davey I enjoy the move to WEEI. Bomb that effects it has of the zero impact on me. I enjoy update but I'd say I enjoy it more because in this into the sound really sappy rich is much happier doing what he's doing. Now I feel like Danny's given room to do things like this which he really excel that so in that regard yes I am happy. Yes to browse at the sports I was recording there are those kind of doing it like on the sly and not really telling anybody can they didn't really. They really care about podcasts in their whereas it WEEI they're all about podcasting immediately loved it and so I can use the studios here. And it's no problem so I'd I will say I like our old logo better. But that was also a lot of copyright infringement bells are our buddy dual. Me and him design that art duo decided I'd coupled ideas America. And it's awesome but if it's going to be really become a thing we can't use that look come on let's see. Rich what is your exact to new salary before taxes compared to the one from the hub. Well I'm not gonna answer it Marcus. I can't I can't I won't I won't do it although I will tell you out to the listener whatever you think that it is it's less. I I dare I dared the with less though everything it is what movies do you completely disagree on TV series games sticks that are. Com. I can tell you up to bat but the TV series that we disagree on or just don't I don't care for that I watched to see and other is that it actually the wire right. That's that's definitely one. Yeah I don't think there's really any movies now I don't think you guys it's clear we do agree on a lot of it now you don't like the screen movies as much as I do that's because nobody does. I know I watch yeah I mean trying to trying to think what we've are generally. I watch like other in my column my non dork like what I walked like I would really like is like documentaries about it weird people. If you like prom and make none on and on and I know early and those types of things but like I am for some reason I just like really screwed up people. Then that's fine I also found that like with a lot of the stuff. Not just the debut with anybody in your Summers like all I really love this movie. I hard. Like arguing about that because Eric you loved it good for you here particularly particularly slick guy like that will be. Right here is that that's hard to really get through a big drag out about that. Democrats and Buick Buick two point speaking of that Marcus assets you ever considered a wife swap. Now ever now but I opens like a Tea Party. Yeah they're about other people want to elect right out of there has to be yet. Is direct trade that things get messy. That's message but it is sort of luck of the draw like losing your keys and these are your keys have been that leads to whatever that leads to whatever. The next question Richard. Or I'll I'll I'll let that post. Richard have you seen David do black panther lions if not how do you know it's not the real black panther. That's very fair Marcus I don't know I don't know audiences that. Deserted island one movie one book one type of food for the rest of your life. Deck ready yes. Ready player one Bayer and declined as my in my book that the big about ski is my movie up. And ginger ale I'm taking ginger ale. Mine would be gender but there's a good my movie would be. Believe or not Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Because I believe icy clouds otherwise I've seen that movie more. Than any other movie in my life and I'm not sick of it and it goes on right now I can watch it again and so for a desert island or deserted island. I would watch that and I'd be found that I go watch that every day literally to. People say desert I don't wanna be and it got him as an island deserted okay deserted him and I read that wrong the minute. My one book I'm actually I would he. The long Halloween and we I know it's a graphic gobbled up like tower of the book that I did a book. Much food or anything buffalo chicken at a buffalo chicken some buffalo chicken wrap buffalo chicken sandwich or whatever the more that. Handle lastly. Who would win in one on one basketball. Life played basketball baby didn't. I know you weren't worth basketball player on the planet as per person now. For a person who was general generally. Very elect athletic yeah like I could do a lot of things yeah. Basketball. Not that you just can't but couldn't figure it out and maybe it's the small answer that you know. Lack of height. Something and I don't know what it was but it did not translate to about possible court. Oh quick scatter report Davie was a like a fullback linebacker in high school I was there eight. Wide receiver Warner slash safety. Emergency quarterback if need be. On David is a very good hockey player I've played basketball at and we both played. All the high school and we both play in the outfield in baseball are debuts a better hitter I was off faster and had a better armed. How I would guess that associate that an apparent agreement that. I would say until OK before you do it you're you're put in all the latest superlative about yourself. We'll tell you that while Richard was faster top end speed I probably get better jumped out fly ball and he'd. Apparent. I would like yet think of like gay legged Gary Brecher Jim had been tight. Who had a daughter who had about a forty time. Who I got better reads who would suggest he will look good and intact yeah. And despite this might be our biggest fight right now we were just get hot cold despite the year despite. This well so I was actually gonna take the easy way out and say. Just it's just so we didn't have a huge bite on the air I was they've we played a hundred times. It would probably be 65. I actually agree I think that actually happened I think you'd literally did happen once and we miss him with these people walked in there like these are the really. We just have planned missile sites like just the two we do it yeah and then who went there. And that yet you've had the deaths were to switch around whatever and then applied to the death debuted. It. Hot right now I let let luck this back a little bit. Just reading yet. I would say president rules. Richard I would I can assume that there was if there would be one point where I thought he was done and I would be holding him down until like Eric you've done. And he would say dad and I would turn around maybe hit it to Beckett at this of the. Wells prison rules about pointed out yet but that's went straight up fight I want yes pretty rule you Teddy bear than a I am I say we skip the pick of the podcast this week because we just had several picks of the podcast and there must get rid of as you really have some of these say. And I know I did a video game minutes. And it's a work of art. So the last thing I was gonna say is again thanks to everybody who's listened we really appreciate that thanks to all the other co host we've had. And it's been great we've got along with the people that that have helped us out have co hosted in. A Germany he'll be back for more episodes in the future also special links to low ball. Mac can view and the boxers podcast. Mac and herb who was the warm like us so who came up puller first logo and the boxers markets specifically has come up with a a lot of our imaging that we use now on the podcast that's sort of a missile triumph weren't. Between the podcasts. We each listen to each other's stuff and it's been a lot of fun doing that now another thing those guys. Over the poker points RO POP is very supportive and that's our opening theme here's a question for you shouldn't we may. T shirts because the boxers and Mac and who stumbled upon this website. That you can make T shirts and you people can go online. And order Rohm and do it mail handle all the shipping and handling and all that stuff through that. I guess there are question not just do you rider beat of the listener would that be something worth doing. Unfortunately I thought maybe ideally a bunch of free T shirts from WEEI that hasn't happened yet. But if I made T shirts that people could purchase without even be something worth doing. Iberia I hate. This is this is something that like I think about all the time and I work with. You know 400 limit lived and worked with 400 high school boys and by just you know. Say the word you know we were seldom teacher to that's free advertising right there so yeah port. All right so I think I think we do well I know those guys have of the bunch different things and well we'll cook something up will focus on that up with the with the logo maybe some sayings from the programmer or wherever also we might be in the T shirt business gangs so. Stay tuned for that again he could follow us at dork podcast thanks for Alyssa and all these you can emails to our podcast at gmail.com. If you wanna get all the just Davey you can asked.

Nintendo Switch The Google Phone app — also available for Android One — received updated spam protection back in July of 2016. In addition to the detection service, the incoming call screen turns red when a suspected spammer calls in. Google notes that for Voice these improvements catch 2x more spammers and identities 40% more calls correctly as unwanted. For users, this results in 20% fewer spam reports. The original Voice also had spam detection, with the new desktop and mobile apps featuring a dedicated page for filtered calls, text messages, and voicemail. However, this option can also be disabled if users get too many false positives by going to Security under Settings. Improved spam filtering should already be live on Google Voice’s Android, iOS, and web clients. Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

Where to start with a Samsung Galaxy S phone launch? These phones aim to be the very best on the market and in recent years, they’ve arguably succeeded. But Samsung has always had a habit of hyping them through the roof and sending them to market laden with gimmicky features that can range from I-can’t-believe-they-invented-it to utterly terrible. And yet last year’s Samsung Galaxy S7 ended up being our Phone of the Year (once the price had dropped) and is still a great buy. Now here’s the S8. In the past few months, we’ve reviewed all of the rival flagships – the HTC U Ultra, the Huawei Mate 9, the Oppo R9s Plus, the LG G6, the ZTE Axon 7, the Google Pixel XL and of course the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. In each case we’ve compared the phones to the potential of Samsung’s best and lamented that there has not been one great all-round phone to rule them all… yet. So does the S8 live up to all the the hype? Absolutely not. Is it the best all-round phone on the market and the one you should probably buy? Yes it is. Here’s why… Key specs 5.8in, 1440 x 2960 LCD screen, 64GB/4GB RAM, 2.35GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 835 CPU, Adreno 540 GPU, 12MP rear camera plus 8MP front camera, microSD (dual SIM slot on some models), USB-C, IP68 dust/waterproof, Iris scanner, Android 7, 3000mAh battery, 149 x 79 x 8mm, 155g. Full specs here. Handling and design Curved screens We’ve poured scorn onto Samsung’s curved phone screens many times before. For years gushing commentators have drunk the Kool-Aid and raved about them while simultaneously acknowledging that they make the most basic phone tasks (like typing and scrolling) a pain in the posterior to perform (here's why). This year both the S8 and larger S8+ have slightly-curved, bezel-less front screens which made us think we'd have to perform the review in a case. But we needn’t have worried. While there were some instances of our peripheral fingers interfering with phone operations, it wasn’t enough to be regularly annoying. Still, if you have Jimi Hendrix-like fingers, a case is probably a good idea. The whole phone is ensconced in Corning’s top-end Gorilla Glass 5 and, unlike the slippery-as-heck Galaxy Note 7, is actually quite impressive at sticking to your hand – even in wet environments like a steam room... yes, we tried. It sure looks pretty, but even Gorilla Glass cracks and we, once again, recommend using a case. The 5.8-inch AMOLED screen is as bright and colourful as we hoped (it’s also sunglasses proof – you can look at it in either orientation while wearing sunnies). The unusual Ultra High Definition resolution of 1,440 x 2,960 reflects the newer 18:9 screen ratio that we first saw on the LG G6. Having used both of these phones for some weeks, we can attest that going back to the old-school “fat” 16:9 ratio phones like the Google Pixel XL and HTC U Ultra just feels weird now – why would anyone want a phone they can’t easily fit their hand around? These longer-and-thinner form factor phones are far more comfortable to hold, easier to operate and they don’t feel like the screen is smaller at all. The screen only curves slightly at the sides (unlike previous models) which creates an interesting effect that wasn’t annoying, even when watching movies (with their distorted edges). Consequently, unlike previous Samsungs, there’s no dedicated 'Edge' apps to make use of the curves of the screen (there’s no room) but there is still a Samsung "Apps Edge" slide-out app which provides a shortcut to your favourite apps. We found that trying to get this slider to reliably appear was a bit more effort than simply pressing the main button to bring up the home screen, though. The long 18:9 screen means that it can easily be split into multiple Windows. Meanwhile a long-press on the icons brings up a context menu. The whole operating environment apes a stock Android operating environment. You can swipe left and right across your main screens or up to reveal the app-drawer with everything laid out in a customiseable way. As with the Pixel XL, there are some potentially-useful context menus that appear when you long-press an icon. In terms of performance, there are some minor differences between US and European specs. The US model gets Qualcomm’s brand new 2.35GHz octa-core Snapdragon 835 processor with Adreno 540 GPU for games. The European spec (which Australia gets) uses Samsung’s interpretation of the same thing: a 2.3GHz octa-core Exynos 8895 processor plus Mali-G71 MP20 GPU. Some people will rave over benchmarks. After testing every phone on the market we can vouchsafe that there’s nothing faster than this phone. All software execution is as instant as you could expect. Top drawer stuff. There's only one main speaker at the bottom but it was actually quite impressive. Conference calls were crisp and clear and music actually felt like it had some depth to it - treble didn't wash out and there was a slight punch to the bass. It all gets reasonably loud but not as much as speaker-laden rivals. Next to this is a proper 3.5mm headphone jack... it's ridiculous that we have to mention that these days. Biometric security The headline feature here is the Iris Scanner. This was a gimmick with the ill-fated Note 7 – the response time and lag was horrendous. However, it’s very usable now and became our favoured way of unlocking the phone. Sure, staring at your own haggard brow several times a day won’t be fun for anyone outside the selfie generation, but simply staring at your phone to unlock things is a welcome feature. Samsung also provides some virtual masks to disguise yourself while your eyes get scanned. The fingerprint button is more of an issue, though. Firstly, it’s positioned awkwardly right next to the camera lens so you’ll regularly be sullying that by accident. It’s also a bit awkward to reach with your finger and you’ll find yourself unnaturally stretching to activate it. Once you have reached it, it doesn’t always work straight away. After getting used to the speed of the Oppo R9s' and R9s Plus' fingerprint readers recently, we have little tolerance for any delay here, but the Samsung’s reader only worked quickly on most occasions. Sometimes it just gave up and demanded we use a different unlocking method. This was annoying and will likely become even more annoying when making use of future Samsung Pay features. You can also unlock the phone with face recognition (which is the quickest and most reliable method) but this didn’t work in the dark. Beyond that there’s the usual Android pattern unlock and code unlock. Frankly we missed the reliable knock code of the LG G6 a bit. However, with a plethora of unlock options on hand it usually meant that any annoyance with unlock speeds was short-lived. Samsung’s software and crapware The Good It wouldn’t be a Samsung phone if it wasn’t laden with ridiculous half-baked features-and-claims and this is a Samsung phone in every sense of that description. First off, the good stuff. The Knox security – which is now simply called Secure Folder – is still present meaning that you can install private apps, messaging services and nudie pictures all in one secure area where the kids, friends and family won’t accidentally see them. There’s also the under-advertised Send SOS Messages feature which will send an audio clip, photo and your location to your selected contacts if you press the power button quickly three times. Samsung Pay – where you can use your phone to tap and go in stores – looks like it will grow legs. It wasn’t operating on our test S8 for pre-launch reasons however, we recently experienced it with the lesser Samsung Galaxy A5. It will happily copy your bar-code-based loyalty cards and free up some room in your wallet but where it’s only been operational with AmEx and Citibank cards (in Australia) it will now work with Westpac cards too. Hopefully the fingerprint reader won’t make this a chore. The updated Game Tools feature is potentially useful. This set of apps can lock the screen to avoid accidentally launching other things as well as take screen shots, record gameplay and block alerts while you’re playing. Game Tools is easier to access and use on the S8. The Palm Wipe for screenshot finally seems to work more often than not, but you can still do this by pressing the power button and volume-down. The power saving modes are also useful but we’ll cover those more in Battery Life, below. The bad The Samsung Galaxy S2 is arguably what made Samsung the premium brand that it is today – it was the first modern smartphone that was generally considered to be better than the iPhone. Then the S3, S4 and S5 all appeared and they resembled the S2 with increasing amounts of Samsung-branded bloatware dragging everything down. Thankfully, that is far less of an issue now – many of Samsung’s “special” features are separate, elective downloads these days. But there’s still some pointless stuff here. While other phone makers have given up on separate web browsers in order to use Google’s own Chrome, Samsung still persists with its own internet browser which can be synced with Samsung’s own cloud account. It will open all weblinks by default until you tell it not to. Other minor fails revolve around using the fingerprint readers as a heart-rate monitor... they kept telling us we'd flatlined. Great. Bixby and virtual assistants One of the biggest features – according to Samsung – of the Samsung Galaxy S8 is Samsung’s new virtual assistant, Bixby. Early commentators were gushing about this but we had our concerns – as anyone who had suffered through Samsung’s abortive previous voice recognition attempts with S-Voice and S-Drive would naturally do. Firstly, the voice recognition won’t be working at launch because it’s not ready. There will be an even longer delay in Australia while Samsung tries to decipher what the bloody hell we’re all saying, eh? But we’re not holding our breath. The most intrusive/annoying feature of Bixby is Bixby Vision. This is where you take a picture and Bixby Vision nags you by wanting to analyse what’s in it. It’s total crap. If anything it’s entertaining to use just so you can laugh at how badly it fails. Seeing how terrible Bixby Vision is can be a fun game. Although it did once correctly identify a chair. Yay. The rest of Bixby is basically a second-rate clone of Google Now – screens that give you “helpful” information about your day and current location. It hasn’t all been working properly pre-launch but again... we’re not holding our breath. This is Google’s bread and butter and thankfully the excellent Google Assistant is already up and running on this phone plus it’s easy to turn most of Bixby off. Bixby Voice isn't even working yet. All it is is a second-rate Google Now. Unfortunately, though, Samsung has seen fit to add a special Bixby button below the volume rocker meaning you’ll hit it and launch the waste-of-space by accident on many occasions. We’ve been told that this button will be re-programmable down the line. The sooner the better. Samsung Galaxy S8 camera review We were expecting very great things from the S8’s main, 12-megapixel camera. Its predecessor had one of the very best fast-focusing, low-light cameras on the market. We were not disappointed. Frankly, it’s brilliant. Focusing is effectively instantaneous, usually accurate and there’s rarely any shutter lag. It’s best in class for all of these facets along with the Google Pixel – maybe even better. Fast focusing, little-to-no shutter lag and impressive exposure skills meant that even moving animals (and kids) were usually sharp. There’s even a Selective Focus mode which fakes a Bokeh effect. While getting this working proved very inconsistent (at least if it didn’t work it just took a normal picture) it did make for some impressive shots. The Selective Focus mode means that image information is captured across all focal lengths allowing you to blur foreground or background and refocus later on. It usually looked good on the few occasions that it actually worked. This effect could still go wrong thanks to some messy transitions from blurred-to-sharp though. It was never going to beat Huawei’s dual-lens Leica phones for this effect but it’s still nice to have the potential for something similar. Colours are vibrant, low-light performance is amazing and gimmicky Snapchat-Pupper-like features are massive hit with the kids. Kids and SnapChatters will love the augmented reality pictures. Food mode ramps up the colour and can do some interesting focusing effects. Colours were vibrant and exposure correct in all kinds of challenging lighting conditions. This sleeping bub was in a VERY dark room. The 8-megapixel Selfie camera is also sharp and fast. There are also many 'Beauty Mode' adjustments if you need them. We also struggled to fault movies too. With 4K recording, image stabilisation was impressive as was audio capture. Focusing was generally smooth and fast although moving from close-up to wide-angle occasionally needed a screen-tap nudge. The impressive dynamic range of the movie camera meant that detail outside bright windows was captured. Dynamic range was impressive with detail in bright areas being captured when most of the scene was only modestly lit. While some grain did appear when in dark areas, it still offered the best-in-class low light performance of any phone's camera that we’ve seen. That all said, we actually preferred shooting at 60fps in Full HD. The smooth-tracking high-resolution quality was even more comfortable to watch.

Google Voice now has improved spam call filtering Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 2:47pm PDTApr 18, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 11 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 Applications Google News No one likes spam calls, and Google knows that. You may recall that last year, Google added a warning in the Phone app for when a suspected spam caller was ringing. Now the company is bringing that same feature to Google Voice. According to a post on the Google Voice Help Forum, the new filter catches twice as many spammers, reports 40% more calls correctly as spam, and results in 20% fewer reports from users. Again, this is the same feature that the Phone app on Pixel, Nexus, and Android One devices already have - Google Voice users just get to enjoy it too. You can make sure it's on by enabling spam filtering in the webapp or mobile app. See the link below for the original source.

Google is testing a new, more compact weather card Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 9:14am PDTApr 18, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 70 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares150 Google News The Google app feed (formerly known as Google Now) includes relevant bits of data from around the web and culled from your own data. One card we almost all have is weather, and Google looks to be experimenting with a new version of that one. Rather than the large card with the forecast, the new one is a single line with a few bits of relevant information. The new card shows the current conditions and forecast for the current day. The old card is much larger and includes the 5-day extended forecast. You can, of course, tap on the new card and get all that same information and more in the full weather screen. You can see the new card above and another comparison below. Left: New card, Right: Old card We've had a few reports of the new card rolling out, but it's still the larger one on all my devices. It's not clear if Google intends to make this the new default for everyone soon, or if it's still fooling around with it.

I can see the current weather on the home screen of my Pixel. The larger card is nice for glancing ahead to see if more detailed information is warranted. I'm not sure which might be more efficient though. Probably six of one, a half dozen of another. Willie Chalmers III I got this a couple of weeks ago, but it went away very quickly. I do prefer the larger one though. Did anyone else get an update to the traffic card that made it smaller? George I don't know... it seems like Google is testing all their products on us nowadays..

OK, maybe Bixby has a chance. navjot This is pretty cool. Hopefully they expand it to other cards, there are some in there that take up much more space than they need to.

In today’s technology and data-driven age, consumers are eager to validate their purchase decisions, and seek to do so by using social media and real-time feedback from other consumers as their key resources. But how exactly are consumers using local search services and online review sites to find and assess businesses? What kind of impact do reviews and ratings have on their path to purchase? After examining in greater detail the research and decision-making process of today’s consumers, customer feedback software company ReviewTrackers recently released the results of its first-ever Local Search and Online Reviews Survey. Here are some key findings: 67.7% consumers say that at least half of their searches result in a visit to a local business These visits then eventually translate into sales, with at least half of local searches eventually leading to a purchase for 57.7% of consumers. Analysis One of the most interesting aspects of local search is how it affects visitor traffic and revenue. Based on ReviewTrackers’ research, local searches conducted by consumers often carry high purchase intent. Want to drive conversions? Work on improving local search rankings on Google. Also, develop a strategy for securing more (and better) reviews, optimizing your information on business listings across the web, and creating user experiences which inspire in-store visits and sales. Over 50% of consumers often or always check out online reviews, while only 34% seek out information on discounts and pricing Analysis As one might expect, consumers - equipped with, and empowered by, an expanding range of Internet devices - are fairly active in searching for specific types of information when assessing local businesses. In fact, only a small percentage of survey respondents admitted to never looking for local business information like online reviews, location, hours, directions, and discounts. Based on the results, it seems that convenience plays a significant role in consumers’ research and decision-making process, with location and hours ranking as the top two types of business information they look for. Interestingly, consumers are more active in trying to find online reviews than in hunting for discounts, with over 50% of consumers 'often or always' checking out online reviews, compared to the 34% that seek out information on discounts and pricing. This suggests that having an effective reviews and reputation management strategy may be more beneficial to local businesses than launching special promotions or offering discounted prices. (Previous studies have already suggested that better reviews and higher ratings can lead to greater demand and pricing flexibility.) 62.7% of consumers believe that online reviews are “important” or “very important” when choosing a local business Only 3% don't consider reviews when making a purchase decision with a local business. Analysis Online reviews rank highly in terms of importance for consumers looking to make a purchase decision on a local business. These findings echo the results of previous studies, which found that 4 out of 5 consumers reverse their purchase decisions based on negative reviews This reflects the vital shift in today’s marketing landscape, where consumers, instead of marketers, are responsible for shaping the way a brand or business is perceived. Ultimately, what customers say about your business in their online reviews - and how you respond to these reviews - can sway purchase decisions more so than can brand-driven marketing messages, paid advertising, and traditional customer acquisition efforts. 69.9% of consumers read reviews in the beginning of, and during, the research phase By comparison, only 4.1% read reviews at the stage where they've already made an initial choice and are looking to double-check it. Analysis Reviews serve as useful resources for consumers at every stage of their journey, but they're particularly impactful in the early stages. These numbers reflect similar findings made by Social Media Link, which found that 83% of consumers discover businesses every month through peer-to-peer reviews. Indeed, along with local search results, reviews are an important peer-to-peer contribution to trust, helping shape the first impressions that consumers have of a business. As a foremost source of information, reviews are particularly useful at helping consumers discover new products and services through local search.   63.3% of consumers trust businesses with overall ratings of 4.0 or 4.5 stars out of 5 Only 2.5% trust businesses with overall ratings of 2.0 stars or less. Star ratings matter, and according to survey results, the ideal rating for purchase probability is 4.0 stars out of 5, followed by 4.5 stars out of 5. It’s worth noting that today’s consumers often perceive ratings closer to a perfect 5.0 as too good to be true, and they appreciate less-than-perfect reviews and ratings as an important element in their research and decision-making process. While your business should continue to shoot for perfection, you must also recognize that consumers specifically seek trustworthy, authentic - and therefore often imperfect - reviews and ratings. It’s critical that you’re able to resist the temptation to delete, ignore, or censor negative feedback, critical reviews, and low ratings. Conclusion The continued growth of online reviews has led to a shift in consumers’ purchase behavior, from the way they search for local businesses to the way to make purchase decisions. In particular, the impact of reviews on local search performance, online reputation, and ultimately revenue is undeniable. By embracing and leveraging reviews, your business can drive customers to your door and build your reputation and search visibility in ways that will make a positive impact on your bottom line.

Some customers have taken to Google’s product forums to complain that a recent update to their relatively new Google Wifi routers have resulted in drops in connectivity. Google, in response, just yesterday offered two temporary solutions to the problems: set up Google WiFi from scratch using a different account, or disconnect Windows 10 or Xbox devices from Wi-Fi. The complaints and the suggested workarounds, posted by the “WiFi Care Team” in a Google product forum, were first spotted by 9to5Google. Neither of the workaround are particularly ideal, but Google did say that its engineering team is “still working on a final fix for this issue.” Google began selling these routers late last year, for $129 as a single device or $299 for a bundle of three, and received largely positive early reviews (including our own review). However, since then there have been some snafus. In February, Google said it inadvertently restored a number of Google WiFi and OnHub routers to their factory settings, erasing all device names and using settings, which required said users to hard reset their routers and set them up again. Now, it seems the issues are around basic connectivity; although Google has not yet responded to Verge requests for more information or a timeline for when a more permanent solution might be offered.

A central feature in the new Google Earth is Voyager. Google has teamed up with NASA, the BBC and other groups to add video clips, photos and text narratives to three-dimensional representations of particular locations. The Jane Goodall Institute, for instance, lets you journey to spots in Tanzania that inspired its founding chimpanzee expert. You can also get overlays of chimpanzee ranges and compare imagery from 2005 and 2014 to see the effects of forest restoration efforts. TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Business news first: Sign in for newsletters The producers of “Sesame Street” show off Muppets from around the world. The map shows where the Muppets live and offers stories about the region and its culture. A new “I’m Feeling Lucky” feature takes you to a random lesser-known destination as Google Earth highlights places locals might frequent or know about, such as the Indonesian island of Bunaken, part of a national marine park. Google Earth used to be the place to go to for satellite views and 3-D images. A software download was required, limiting its use. Google Maps has incorporated many of those features, making Google Earth even less necessary. Tuesday’s update is designed to give people a reason to use Google Earth again. With the update, Google Earth works on Chrome browsers for desktops. It still requires an app for phones and tablets. The Android app will be updated, but there’s no Google Earth app for iPhones or iPads yet. Acquisitions Post to buy Weetabix Post Holdings, the company behind Fruity Pebbles, Honey Bunches of Oats and other cereals, said Tuesday that it is buying the maker of British breakfast brand Weetabix as it seeks to expand overseas. It is paying about $1.8 billion to buy Weetabix from Shanghai’s Bright Food Group and Baring Private Equity Asia. Besides its namesake cereal, Weetabix also makes Alpen and Barbara’s Puffins. Post of St. Louis said that the deal will allow it to expand overseas markets for its U.S. brands and make Weetabix available in North America. Weetabix, a rectangular wheat biscuit that breaks apart when it absorbs milk, is the second-biggest ready-to-eat cereal brand in the United Kingdom, according to market research company Euromonitor. The deal is expected to close by September. Shares of Post fell $3.29 to $84.51. Earnings BofA profit up by nearly 40% Bank of America’s first-quarter profit grew nearly 40 percent, the bank said Tuesday, helped by higher interest rates as well as a strong performance in its investment banking division. The North Carolina bank reported net income of $4.86 billion (41 cents per share), compared with $3.47 billion in the same period a year earlier. Analysts expected 35 cents per share. “The U.S. economy continues to show consumer and business optimism, and our results reflect that,” CEO Brian Moynihan said in a statement. Like its major competitors, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, Bank of America benefited from higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates once in December and again in March, which has allowed the big retail banks to charge more for their loans. The bank said it had net interest income of $11.06 billion, compared with $10.49 billion in the same period a year earlier. Government Ballmer offers spending data Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has created a new organization to analyze government spending and revenue to make it easier to understand. He says he created USAFacts because he was frustrated that he couldn’t find a single source that combined all the relevant local, state and federal numbers. Ballmer gathered a group of data specialists that spent nearly three years compiling the information, which is available at the USAFacts website. The reports will be updated periodically. “I’m a numbers guy, and I think the appropriate role of numbers is to help take complicated situations and simplify them,” Ballmer said. Ballmer, who bought the Los Angeles Clippers after retiring from Microsoft in 2014, said that he has invested roughly $10 million in USAFacts and will spend several million a year on it.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google unveils new Google Earth: Do you feel lucky? By Ethan Baron / April 18, 2017 at 3:34 PM Google Earth has just gotten much easier to use and now has some striking new features. The Mountain View tech giant rolled out the new version of Earth on April 18, on the firm’s Chrome browser. An Android mobile operating system version will be launched in the coming week, with versions for Apple’s iOS and other browsers coming “in the near future,” Google said in a blog post. New features include “Voyager,” a collection of guided virtual tours of locations such as Gombe National Park in Tanzania, where viewers can “hear from Jane Goodall about her team’s chimpanzee research and conservation efforts.” On the left side of the screen is one member of a pair of dice. This is the “I’m feeling lucky” icon, and it brings the user to a spot on the globe of Google’s choosing. On our first test use, we were taken to Happo-One Ski Resort in Japan. Unfortunately, the imagery appeared to be from fall, not ideal for virtually viewing a winter wonderland. So we took another geographical gamble. And happily, we ended up in Jamaica! Dunns River Falls, however, was obscured by jungle. But no matter — the world is our oyster. It seems the third time’s the charm, as Earth took us to one of our favorite countries, Greece, and deposited us on the island of Cythera, where we studied the gorgeous beaches and turquoise waters and made plans in our head to visit for real. While Voyager has some interesting content, and the “feeling lucky” button provides a bit of fun and possible future-travel fodder, the best thing about the new Earth is how fast, smooth and easy it is to change perspectives. By clicking on the shift key and using the cursor, adjusting viewing angle feels intuitive, and allows for quick, sweeping changes of viewpoint.   Photo: Technology workers are seen outside a Google office building (Bay Area News Group) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: android, Apple, chrome, Google, Google Earth, iOS, map   More Posts in 1 Theranos gets wrist-slap fine from feds, agrees to do no clinical lab work for two years April 17, 2017   General Motors to expand San Francisco self-driving car unit, hire more than 1,100 people April 14, 2017   Warriors’ basketball star Andre Iguodala appears to spill secrets of Google-backed tech firm April 13, 2017       Share this Post Tweet               Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Home sales and prices jump across the Bay Area, California Google unveils new Google Earth: Do you feel lucky?

Esther Afua Ocloo: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Published 11:31 pm EDT, April 17, 2017 Updated 2:07 am EDT, April 18, 2017 3 Comments By Paul Farrell 12.6k Share Tweet Share Email Follow (Google) A female African business pioneer has been chosen by Google to be honored in the April 18 doodle. Esther Afua Ocloos was known as “Auntie Ocloo” in her homeland of Ghana. She was born there in 1919 and by the 1930s she had started to build her food empire. It was the difficulties Ocloo had in acquiring start up cash that saw become a trailblazer in the world of microlending. A practice that helps alleviate poverty and help people with no collateral get their business ideas up and running. Ocloo was afforded a state funeral in Ghana when she passed away in 2002. That should give you an idea of the esteem in which she was held in her homeland, and across the world. The doodle appears on what would have been Ocloos’ 98th birthday. Here’s what you need to know about the life of Esther Afua Ocloos: 1. Ocloo Was the First Black Person to Graduate From the Good Housekeeping Institute in London According to the Dictionary of African Biography’s section for Ocloo, it talks about her education at the illustrious Achimota School in Ghana. She attended the boarding school from 1936-41 on a scholarship and needed money from her aunt and a grant from chocolate giant Cadbury to continue her studies. Cadbury purchased much of their cocoa in Ghana. Upon graduation, Ocloo was given another scholarship by the school to attend the Good Housekeeping Institute in London and take a Food Preservation Course at Bristol University. Ocloo was the first black person to graduate from the housekeeping institute in 1951. After leaving school, Ocloo set up a food canning business on Africa’s Gold Coast. Her products were orange juice and marmalade. She sold her goods outside of government buildings in Ghana’s capital of Accra as well as to the West Africa Frontier Force. The business expanded into the 1950s while Ocloo spent time in England studying the food canning industry there. Her company was named Nkulenu Industries and it still exists today. Nkulenu was her maiden name. According to Google’s blog on Ocloo, she had great difficulty in securing a loan from a bank to get her business off the ground. 2. Ocloo Was One of the Founders of the Women’s World Banking in 1979 As her business continued to grow in Ghana through out the 1960s, Ocloo served in a number of positions for other organizations. Ocloo was the president of the Federation of Ghana Industries. She was also the Executive Chairman of the National Food and Nutrition Board of Ghana. Her profile on Nkulen’s website adds that Ocloo was “a member of Ghana’s national Economic Advisory Committee from 1978 to 1979 and a member of the Council of State in the Third Republic of Ghana from 1979 to 1981.” Ocloo’s focus shifted in the 1970s when she became involved in the women’s liberation movement. Among her more notable roles, Ocloo was a founder and the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Women’s World Banking. Earlier, in 1975, Ocloo had been an advisor for the United Nations First World Conference on Women. Google’s blog posting on Ocloo mentions that in the 1970s, she became involved in the microlending industry. When talking about this the blog reads that the Women’s World Banking provided “millions of low-income women with the small loans needed to reach their financial goals.” 3. Despite Attending a Prestigious Boarding High School, Ocloo Would Prepare Food at Home at the Weekends for the Coming Week Ocloo had been born into poverty in the Volta Region of Ghana in the town of Peki Dzake. Her father, George, was a blacksmith, and her mother was a potter. The family was able to send Ocloo to a Presbyterian elementary school and later to a boarding school in Peki Blengo. Due to her family’s poverty, at weekends Ocloo would prepare food for the week ahead at school, according to her profile on Nkulenu’s website. 4. Ocloo Says, ‘My Main Goal Is to Help My Fellow Women’ (Wikimedia) In Occlo’s New York Times obituary, she is quoted, in reference to the notion of women she taught competing against her, as once saying, “My main goal is to help my fellow women. If they make better marmalade than me, I deserve the competition.” Occlo is quoted in the Dictionary of African Biography as saying about women’s economic independence, “Women must know that the strongest power in the world is economic power. You cannot go and be begging for every little thing, but at the moment, that’s what the majority of what our women do.” During her lifetime, Occlo also set up a farm in Ghana that was specifically used to teach women agricultural cultivation. Ocloo died in Accra, Ghana, in 2002 after she had contracted pneumonia. Her state funeral took place in Accra while she was buried in Peki Dzake. She was married during her life to Stephen Ocloo. The couple had a daughter, Vincentia, and three sons, Vincent, Christian and Steven Junior. 5. In 2005, the United Nations Celebrated the International Year of Microcredit Ocloo’s belief in microcredit has carried through after her death. In 2005, the United Nations named it the International Year of Microcredit. The system is still used in the developing world due to having “enormous potential as a tool for poverty alleviation.” Generally, microcredit programs allow for small loans to be given to those with little or no collateral to help them start businesses.

(GhanaWeb) Innovative Ghanaian entrepreneur Esther Afua Ocloo has been honored with a Google Doodle in countries including the U.S., Ghana, Argentina and New Zealand on what would’ve been her 98th birthday. Born Esther Afua Nkulenu in 1919, she advocated for giving small loans to low-income women after she secured a loan for her marmalade business decades later. According to a Google press release, Ocloo had just six shillings in the bank, the equivalent of a dollar, when she sold her first jar of marmalade as a teen during the 1930s. “Esther was determined to expand her livelihood of making marmalade and orange juice, but she needed a loan to increase production, and credit was hard to come by for women with little economic resources,” the release said. “It took persistence and a supply contract to secure the money to start her company, Nkulenu Industries.” Nkulenu Industries, established in 1942 using six of the ten shillings Ocloo’s aunt gave her, according to the website, is a leading company in Ghana’s food processing industry. Its products are distributed in Nigeria, England and the United States and now includes drinks and other staple foods like the dumpling dish kenkey. She was the first person to start a formal food-processing business in Ghana, according to the Independent, and later became the first Black person to earn a cooking diploma from London’s Good Housekeeping Institute. Esther Afua Ocloo helps fellow Ghanaian women in Google Doodle (Google) Known as Auntie Ocloo, her industry success led her to the UK’s Bristol University, where she learned the latest food-industry methods. Ocloo used that knowledge to help other Ghanaian women succeed and went on to establish global nonprofit Women’s World Banking in 1979, where she also served as chairman of the board of directors. Google reported Ocloo founded the organization to help low-income women who were ignored by banks get loans that were difficult to obtain due to lack of collateral. “Women must know that the strongest power in the world is economic power,” she said in a speech in 1990 according to AlJazeera. “You cannot go and be begging to your husband for every little thing, but at the moment, that’s what the majority of our women do.” Ocloo died of pneumonia in 2002 at age 82 after a life of advocating for sustainability and agriculture and offering alternative answers for the issues of hunger and poverty, according to The Guardian. “Her good works in the promotion of development in Ghana cannot be measured,” former Ghanaian president John Agyekum Kufuor said at Ocloo’s state burial.

File/AP Steve Ballmer. File/AP U.S. stocks fall on frustrations with health care companies, Goldman Sachs Apr 18, 2017 Updated 7 hrs ago (…) +1  Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs was a drag on the Dow on Tuesday. File/AP NEW YORK — U.S. stocks fell Tuesday after weak first-quarter reports from Johnson & Johnson and Goldman Sachs frustrated investors who hope company earnings are on the rise. Health care companies lost the most. Wall Street has high hopes for earnings this spring, and weak results from the world's largest health care products company and one of the biggest financial firms had them concerned. Investors also looked for safety after the British government called for a surprise early election next month. According to S&P Global Markets Intelligence, investors expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to rise almost 10 percent compared to last year. That would be the biggest jump since 2014. The S&P 500 index shed 6.82 to close at 2,342.19. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 113.64 to 20,523.28, with Goldman Sachs responsible for most of that loss. The Nasdaq fell 7.32 to 5,849.47. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks recovered from an early loss and rose 0.71 to 1,361.89. Google Earth gets tools for exploration NEW YORK — Google Earth is getting a revival, with the 3-D mapping service becoming more of a tool for adventure and exploration. A central feature in the new Google Earth is Voyager. Google has partnered with such groups as the BBC, NASA and "Sesame Street" to mix in video clips, photos and text narratives. Before Google Maps brought in real-world imagery, Google Earth was the place to go to for satellite views and 3-D images stitched together from aerial fly-bys. A software download was required, limiting its use. With the update, Google Earth now works on desktop browsers. Google has a mobile app for Android but not iPhones or iPads yet. +1  Steve Ballmer. File/AP Ex-Microsoft CEO compiles spending data NEW YORK — Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has created a new organization to analyze government spending and revenue to make it easier to understand. He says he created USAFacts because he was frustrated he couldn't find a single source that combined all the relevant state and federal numbers. Ballmer gathered a group of data specialists that spent nearly three years compiling the information for its first reports, which are available online at www.USAFacts.org . The reports will be updated periodically. The former Microsoft executive says he wants to provide clear information on government spending, adding that he hopes it will be easier to discuss divisive issues if everyone can agree on the basic facts. He announced the effort Tuesday in a speech at the Economic Club of New York. IMF: global economy set to accelerate WASHINGTON — A resilient China, rising commodity prices and sturdy financial markets are offering a sunnier outlook for the global economy and helping dispel the gloom that has lingered since the Great Recession ended. That's the picture sketched by the International Monetary Fund, which predicts that the world economy will grow 3.5 percent this year, up from 3.1 percent in 2016. The IMF's latest outlook for 2017 is a slight upgrade from the 3.4 percent global growth it had forecast in January. The IMF expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.3 percent, up from 1.6 percent in 2016; the 19-country eurozone to expand 1.7 percent, the same as last year; Japan to grow 1.2 percent, up from 1 percent; and China to expand 6.6 percent, down from 6.7 percent in 2016. Fruity Pebbles owner to buy Weetabix NEW YORK — Post Holdings, the company behind Fruity Pebbles, Honey Bunches of Oats and other cereals, said Tuesday that it is buying the maker of British breakfast brand Weetabix as it seeks to expand overseas. It is paying about $1.8 billion to buy Weetabix from its owners, Shanghai-based Bright Food Group and Baring Private Equity Asia. Besides its namesake cereal, Weetabix also makes Alpen, Barbara's Puffins and other cereals. Post said the deal will allow it to grow its U.S. brands internationally and expand Weetabix in North America. Weetabix, a rectangular wheat biscuit that breaks apart when it absorbs milk, is little known in the U.S. but is the second-biggest ready-to-eat cereal brand in the U.K., according to market research company Euromonitor. The deal is expected to close by September. KFC changing chicken sandwich prep NEW YORK — KFC is aiming to take a bigger bite out of the chicken sandwich market by changing how it prepares them. The chain says it is hoping to improve the taste and is switching from filets that were breaded and frozen offsite before being shipped to the stores in favor of filets breaded at the stores. That's similar to how rivals Chick-fil-A and Popeye's already prepare their chicken. For  KFC, the switch is part of a push to revive business and court younger customers.  A key step is gaining a bigger share of the chicken sandwich market, which KFC says accounts for 40 percent of the fast-food industry's chicken category. Its new "Zinger" chicken sandwich will be introduced next week. Bass Pro, Cabela tweak buyout deal SIDNEY, Neb. — Bass Pro Shops acquisition of rival outdoor gear retailer Cabela's looks a bit more likely with a cheaper price and new terms of the credit card unit's sale. Cabela's said Bass Pro will pay $61.50 per share, or $4.2 billion, for the company, down from $65.50 per share, or $4.5 billion. The company declined to say why the price was cut. Cabela's also says Georgia-based bank Synovus will now buy the credit-card unit as a middleman. Synovus will keep its $1.2 billion in deposits before reselling it to the original purchaser Capital One. Capital One had said banking regulators questioned the deal because of an unrelated issue. Cabela's CEO Tommy Millner says the changes make the deal more certain.

Google Assistant adds support for Lowes Iris, Lutron Caseta, and Osram Lightify Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 3:41pm PDTApr 18, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 11 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares66 Google News Even if you have a wide array of smart home products from different manufacturers, Google wants to make sure they all work seamlessly on Assistant (and thus, the Google Home). The company has gradually added more supported services since launch, and now Assistant works with Lowes Iris, Lutron Caseta, and Osram Lightify. I've never heard of any of these products before, and maybe you haven't either, so I'll go over what these actually are. Lowes Iris is the store's smart home lineup, comprised of light bulbs, outlets, locks, and thermostats. Iris is already compatible with Amazon Alexa, so it's nice to see some support for the Google Home as well. Next up is Lutron Caseta Wireless, which includes dimmers, remote control shades, and a thermostat. Finally, Osram's Lightify product line includes smart LED lamps and light bulbs. If you have any of these devices, you can now connect them to Assistant through the Google Home app. Source: Google Home Help Tags google assistant google home lowe's lowes iris lutron lutron caseta osram osram lightify smart bulb smart home smart lock smart outlet subscribe ...

I want to see more aggressive IoT support from the Googs. A little piglet dies every time I have to concede the Amazon Echo has more IoT support than Google Home. Even though I think the Home is a better product in general. dcdttu You might mention that most if not all of those devices require a hub to work with Google Assistant. Individual items such as a Litton Caseta light switch won't simply work with Google Home. DarenTx I want Hulu support. Alfred Ridiculous. So my Google Home can turn off the lamp for me, but it still can't even play an mp3 I have on my phone or my PC. David Hyman Try all cast or es file Explorers Chromecast player. Both of those options work great for me when I want to cast something. All cast in particular works quite well mlm5em If the song is uploaded to Google play music, can it play from there? Or do you have to actually pay for the GPM subscription plan? (I pay for GPM so I can't test this). surethom If you ask for a song by artist & song title Google home will not play buy assistant on all other android devices will???

As part of their ongoing 10% Project, they talked to some of the people that do the work behind the scenes to create Google Earth, and got a primer on exactly what makes it all tick. In essence, Google Earth is a giant lattice of photography taken at various times, altitudes, and angles, all textured over a giant 3D mesh of the Earth and its features. The reality, of course, is far more complicated. It all starts with 2D satellite imagery. For a long time, this is all that Google Earth and Google Maps had available. The game changed when Google Earth got their people up in the air – literally. Special planes equipped with a liberal amount of cameras all pointed in different directions make multiple passes per day over tons of different locations, stitching together imagery into a giant Earth tapestry. All of this is subject to extensive picking over by both man and machine, pixel by pixel, layer by layer, to strip away elements like fog, clouds, and cars. Thanks to specialized GPS constructs and meticulous record keeping, the time a shot was taken and the plane’s altitude at the time can be used to calculate the trajectory of a shot, which can in turn be used to calculate how an object should look in 3D. Most of this, naturally, is done by computers these days. To round things out, computers pick out similar features from massive samples of imagery, allowing them to figure out what should be in a picture and where, how it should look, and how it all goes together. Imagery is updated and re-stitched on a time frame dependent on factors like how much change is happening and what the population is in that area. Behind the scenes, Google Earth’s roughly 800 billion pixels have some uniquely made technological breakthroughs working on them. Google Earth data also serves as the basis for many data sets and technologies that are used for a wide variety of purposes. One that Google uses and maintains, for example, is called Earth Engine. The basic function of Earth Engine is to mechanically track changes in Google Earth data, and extrapolate valuable insights from them; things like regional deforestation, the effects of droughts, and even logging and fishing can all be tracked. While users getting themselves lost in a virtual copy of our wonderful Earth or flying around it in VR and learning about new places is wonderful, the data obtained by the Google Earth team is put to work in some extremely useful ways that can help to literally change the world.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate.

Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Nope. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ?

Google Assistant adds support for Lowes Iris, Lutron Caseta, and Osram Lightify Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 3:41pm PDTApr 18, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 11 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares66 Google News Even if you have a wide array of smart home products from different manufacturers, Google wants to make sure they all work seamlessly on Assistant (and thus, the Google Home). The company has gradually added more supported services since launch, and now Assistant works with Lowes Iris, Lutron Caseta, and Osram Lightify. I've never heard of any of these products before, and maybe you haven't either, so I'll go over what these actually are. Lowes Iris is the store's smart home lineup, comprised of light bulbs, outlets, locks, and thermostats. Iris is already compatible with Amazon Alexa, so it's nice to see some support for the Google Home as well. Next up is Lutron Caseta Wireless, which includes dimmers, remote control shades, and a thermostat. Finally, Osram's Lightify product line includes smart LED lamps and light bulbs. If you have any of these devices, you can now connect them to Assistant through the Google Home app. Source: Google Home Help Tags google assistant google home lowe's lowes iris lutron lutron caseta osram osram lightify smart bulb smart home smart lock smart outlet subscribe ...

I want to see more aggressive IoT support from the Googs. A little piglet dies every time I have to concede the Amazon Echo has more IoT support than Google Home. Even though I think the Home is a better product in general. dcdttu You might mention that most if not all of those devices require a hub to work with Google Assistant. Individual items such as a Litton Caseta light switch won't simply work with Google Home. DarenTx I want Hulu support. Alfred Ridiculous. So my Google Home can turn off the lamp for me, but it still can't even play an mp3 I have on my phone or my PC. David Hyman Try all cast or es file Explorers Chromecast player. Both of those options work great for me when I want to cast something. All cast in particular works quite well mlm5em If the song is uploaded to Google play music, can it play from there?

The malware was hidden in an app called Funny Videos 2017 which Google has now removed from the Google Play Store, but only after the app had been downloaded between 1,000 to 5,000 times. Dutch security firm Securify discovered it and another app called HappyTimes Videos, also previously available on Google Play, contained the BankBot trojan. The trojan checks for the presence of legitimate banking apps and displays a fake sign-in overlay when the user attempts to launch a targeted bank app. The malware also attempts to steal payment card information by monitoring when users launch popular apps, such as Snapchat, Twitter, and the Play Store. When these apps are launched the malware will display a fake Google Play payment dialogue, requesting payment card details. Russian security firm discovered BankBot infected apps on Google Play in January, but back then it targeted 40 banking apps, mostly in Russian language markets, as well as several US banking apps. According to Securify researcher Niels Croese, the two newer BankBot infected apps target over 400 bank apps, including Australian banking and insurance brands. Among them are the Australian versions of the ING Direct and Citibank apps, AMP, ANZ, Bankwest, Bank of Queensland, Macquarie, NAB, Suncorp, St George, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and Westpac. It also targets New Zealand bank apps, and brands from several European markets. The malicious features were likely added to the Funny Videos app in an update released on April 8, according to Croese.

Researchers at Dr Web in January warned of an expected rise in banking trojans targeting Android users due to the source code for one malicious banking app being published on a hacker forum. Security firm ESET in February also found a bogus version of the Good Weather app on Google Play, which contained the same banking malware targeting 22 Turkish banking apps.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 83 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares164 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate...

He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Nope. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ?

Copycat Syndrome – Good or Bad? April 19, 2017 0 295 ELEVATING TO THE NEXT LEVEL, By Marie-Therese Phido ELEVATING TO THE NEXT LEVEL By Marie-Therese Phido My daughter invited me to a Google dinner as her plus one two weeks ago. I now suddenly find myself in the season where my daughters invite me to events as their companions. The reverse was the case a few years ago. I jumped at the opportunity to attend this particular dinner, when I heard the name Google, as I will soon launch a technology powered business of my own (a story for another day). I wanted to start spending time and hobnobbing with technology egg heads. At the dinner, we got into the conversation of ‘what do you do?’ and I found out that I was seated beside a lady entrepreneur who had launched a technology driven business to address some of our everyday requirements, and other Google staff. When it got to my turn to introduce myself, I told them that I was working on a technology based project which I was not ready to talk about at the time. The lady beside me said, “please share your idea, I do not understand why people are always afraid to share details of the ideas or projects they are working on. Everybody is busy on their own project and nobody is interested in stealing or copying others projects.” I humbly thanked her and said, “while I respect your opinion, I still do not want to share the details of my project”. This conversation got me thinking. I asked myself whether I was being paranoid. Was I thinking too much of myself or did I think my project was so wonderful? I then compared my project to other projects in Nigeria, how ideas have been copied by various people or organisations. Let’s look at a few examples. Ndani TV which started as a quarterly e-Newsletter by GTBank and morphed into its online platform. “Skinny Girl in Transit” a signature programme has gained acceptance and taken the popularity of the platform to a whole new level with global engagement. People across the globe talked about the programme and got hooked. They are now eagerly looking forward to season four. Red TV by UBA and Accelerate by Access Bank have also been launched. I remember when the Lagos Fashion and Design Week started, which was meant to be a replica of the New York, London and Paris Fashion week. We now have the GTBank Fashion Week. What about food and drinks festivals under different umbrellas and name variations – Lagos International Food and Drink Festival, Taste Off Nigeria Food Festival, Eat Drink Festival, GTBank Food and Drink Festival, who first started this food festivals? Will be good to know as establishing who started is confusing. Oded Shanker, a Fisher University Professor in the USA, and author of “Copycats: How Smart Companies Use Imitation to Gain Competitive Edge” argued that “just copying a market leader isn’t clever, instead do what they do better and with a different spin”. Shanker’s argument has played out for the most part where copycats exist. Shanker seems to support the idea of copycats. Global examples will also attest to this, in this case Apple’s IOS and Androids. The claim is that Apple came first and Android followed and improved on the following features according to CNN Money who compared both products using these parameters: login, make a call, check the time, use apps, get and manage notification, listen to music and podcasts, check mail, get directions, find and manage contacts, search, set phone to vibration, talk to your phone, and send text. Android ranked higher than Apple. Crambler an online site also gave ten reasons why the Android is better than Apple. Categories used were: choice, customisation, hardware, the Google Play Store, widgets & multitasking, expandable memory, user serviceability (remove battery), universal charges, durability and other features. Their conclusion was though Android phones and iPhones have their advantages and disadvantages, the Android’s advantages overpowered the advantages you get from the iPhone and gave reasons to back up their assertion. It therefore appears that copying is not such a bad business strategy. Luke Johnson also said, “true entrepreneurs are supposed to shun imitation and try to be authentic and original. I am not convinced this strategy makes commercial sense. Indeed the merits of being a copycat are underrated.” He goes on to say that “after all, every business is derived from something that proceeded it – what lawyers call prior art. The level of replication in any so-called new product or service is simply a matter of degree. Unless you specifically infringe on patent, design, trademark or copyright or are blatantly passing off a rival’s goods as if they were yours”. Some will say Johnson’s opinion lack morals. But, let’s look at it critically; there are very few ideas that are truly authentic and original. Many entrepreneurs find out that it is much quicker, cheaper and lower risk to mimic than to start something from scratch. Luke says, “entrepreneurs need to be humble enough to know when a legal version of someone’s model is better than anything they can devise. I would generally prefer to back a replica of a highly profitable and thoroughly tested business idea – but in a new territory – than invest in a genuinely pioneering idea. What we need to understand about the copycat syndrome: • Note that if you are first to market with any new idea or innovation, be rest assured that the moment you start to achieve traction and success it will be copied. Today we have copycats of Uber in the market – Lyft in the US and Taxify, Swiftly, Redcab amongst others in Nigeria. • Competition exists in all business markets. There is an advantage to this for your business. Competition keeps you on your toes, makes you innovate and differentiate your service or products which will make you more successful. • Copycats are inevitable and unavoidable. Your approach to relating with them will determine your continued success or demise. • Remember that imitation is the greatest compliment and flattery. When people copy you, it means you are on to something great. Anybody copying you is giving you accolades. In conclusion, and a message to myself to address my paranoia, let’s relax, work harder, say thank you, continually improve our service or offerings, improve our customer experience, differentiate, ignore copycats and not allow them steal our mojo!!! – Marie-Therese Phido is Sales & Market Strategist and Business Coach Email: mphido@elevato.com.ng tweeter handle @osat2012; TeL: 08090158156 (text only) Previous articleBridging the Gap Between Official/Parallel Market Rates Next articleNiger Partners NCRI to Boost Rice, Sugar Production Online Editor RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Breaking Ikoyi Billions: Peter Obi Confirms Search of His Apartment by EFCC Nigeria Famine: World Must Aid Nigeria to Avoid ‘Mass Exodus’ Breaking Hunter Becomes the Hunted, House Investigates Arms Probe Panel 988,214FansLike 742,256FollowersFollow Latest News Ikoyi Billions: Peter Obi Confirms Search of His Apartment by EFCC April 19, 2017 Famine: World Must Aid Nigeria to Avoid ‘Mass Exodus’ April 19, 2017 Hunter Becomes the Hunted, House Investigates Arms Probe Panel April 19, 2017 Ex-wife of Factional Boko Haram Leader Caught Loitering in Maiduguri April 19, 2017 NOI Polls: Buhari’s Performance Rating Rises by Five Points April 19, 2017 THISDAY Today (Download) Download Tuesday 18th April 2017 April 19, 2017 0 Recent Comments RumuPHC on The Abuja-Kaduna Airports: A Testimony lukeabu on Ikoyi Billions: Peter Obi Confirms Search of His Apartment by EFCC Fairgame on Ikoyi Billions: Peter Obi Confirms Search of His Apartment by EFCC samG60 on Ikoyi Billions: Peter Obi Confirms Search of His Apartment by EFCC ifobd on Southern Kaduna Killings: Catholic Church Accuses El-Rufai of Alleged Bias MOST COMMENTED Nigeria WAEC Certificate: Buhari Files Appeal against Ruling Dismissing His Objection June 15, 2016 455 Davidson Iriekpen President Muhammadu Buhari has appealed the ruling of Justice Adeniyi Ademola of the Federal High Court in Abuja who on May 26, 2016...

Now, you can access turn-by-turn directions from Google Maps as a widget. This makes it a bit easier to scroll through every upcoming turn on a trip without locking your device. The iMessage app allows you to easily share your location with a friend directly from iMessage, just like you can already with Apple Maps. The real-time location sharing works the same here as it does on Android. Perhaps most interesting is the fact Google's finally brought the Your Timeline feature over from Android. With this, you can see your entire travel history in a nice timeline view. If you want, you can then go back and edit any of those locations with added details. Tap the Settings bar, then Your Timeline to view it. You can also opt into a monthly email that shows where you've been in case you somehow can't remember what you've done in the last 30 days. Of course, if you're not a fan of the idea that Google's tracking your every move even when you're not using the app, you can disable it. Head to Settings > Personal Content > Location History and set the toggle to Off. You can also disable the timeline feature temporarily by heading to Your Timeline > Settings > Pause Location History. If you really want to be doubly sure about information Google Maps has access to, you can head to Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Google Maps and make sure it's set to "While Using the App" and not "Always".

Even though it would cost more to collect the GST than the tax would raise the government wants to kick start this exciting new initiative (not) on 1 July 2017. But the impact could suck big time as eBay suggests they might block overseas retailers from their marketplace.

Screengrab via Google Earth Google Earth, the software program that allows users to virtually explore our planet through topographic maps, satellite imagery, and more, relaunched today with a suite of new features including guided tours of buildings by Frank Gehry and Zaha Hadid. Teaming up with storytellers, scientists, and nonprofits from around the world, Google created “Voyager,” a showcase of interactive guided tours that take users from the mountains, islands, and jungles of the world courtesy of BBC Earth’s “Natural Treasures” to treks on the Galápagos Islands to discoveries of Machu Picchu. As part of Voyager, Google Earth has compiled a tour of six Hadid-designed structures including the MAXXI museum in Rome, the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, and the headquarters of Belgium’s Port Authority in Antwerp. Eight of Gehry’s buildings are also featured, and they include the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany, the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis, the Cinémathèque Française in Paris, and the Dancing House in Prague. Each map point comes with a brief description and the ability to view the structure in 3D or 2D (aerial). This view also provides crucial geographic and spacial context that allows virtual visitors to see the surrounding neighborhoods and cities in which the buildings stand. Other features include “Knowledge Cards” and the ability to experience a locale in 3D and see it from every angle. The relaunch comes just days before Earth Day and is available on the web in Chrome and on Android, rolling out soon.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 83 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares164 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Nope. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ?

According to Google’s announcement, “Cloud Speech API is built on the core technology that powers speech recognition for other Google products (e.g., Google Search, Google Now, Google Assistant), but has been adapted to better fit the needs of Google Cloud customers. Cloud Speech API is one of several pre-trained machine-learning models available for common tasks like video analysis, image analysis, text analysis and dynamic translation.” As Google points out, the Cloud Speech API was actually launched last year where it existed as an open beta, but clearly over the year Google has made some improvements and changes to it based on feedback from developers. This has resulted in improved transcription accuracy for long-form audio, faster processing of about 3x faster than the previous version, and it also now supports more file formats such as WAV, Opus, and Speex. For end-users this probably won’t affect you too much, but like we said with developers now be able to access the API (for a fee), you can expect that some apps will want to take advantage of it.

Al Baldasaro, his wife Judy and wedding party are seen in this 2013 photo that has re-emerged as the main image on Google when searching Londonderry. featured Google search gone awry State Rep's gun-toting wedding photo resurfaces linked to town information By Julie Huss jhuss@eagletribune.com Julie Huss 8 hrs ago COURTESY PHOTOLondonderry GOP state Rep. Al Baldasaro, his wife Judy and wedding party are seen in this 2013 photo that has re-emerged as the main image on Google when searching Londonderry. LONDONDERRY — It's a community known for its sprawling apple orchards and historic charm. And now when searching for Londonderry on Google, it's also known for one local state representative's unique wedding portrait. A 2013 photo showing Republican state Rep. Al Baldasaro along with his gun-toting wedding party has returned as the main image when doing a Google search for information about the town. The photo of Baldasaro, his wife Judy and four attendants reappeared recently after it was removed last month. Town officials had requested the photo be taken down. The photo shows a formally-dressed Baldasaro with his wife and party all dressed in wedding wear and holding long guns while the state representative stands in the center with his arms folded. In addition to the photo, the "knowledge panel" shows a map along with details on Londonderry including population, size, weather, zip code, and community events. According to one Google online support site, knowledge panels started being used in 2012 to help people get quick hit details when searching for communities or businesses. When searching other surrounding towns, there are mostly images of historical buildings or vintage photos including an old postcard showing downtown Derry. When searching Windham, a local school pops up and in Sandown, it's the historic train depot museum that is featured. Pelham's Google search shows the town's congregational church. The town had attempted to remove the photo earlier this year after it first appeared on the Londonderry Google search, according to Town Manager Kevin Smith, saying legal counsel had sent a letter to Google officials. The letter requested the Baldasaro photo be replaced with one that was more representative of the town of Londonderry, Smith said. That sparked a brief removal of the photo, but the image was back online this week. "It was removed, not sure how or why," Smith said. "It came down, but we found out it's back up." It may have something to do with an algorithm Google uses when people search communities that makes a photo the most popular due to the number of "clicks" it gets, making it a top choice to be featured, the town manager added. When contacted Tuesday, Baldasaro said he just found out the previous day that the photo had re-emerged. "And if they don't like it, tough, they will get over it," he said. The Rockingham County District 5 state representative and veteran said the photo first came to prominence before the Google incident when he said someone pulled the picture off a social media site to potentially be used against him politically. "It ended up going national," Baldasaro said. He said he likes the picture, but it's taking on a life of its own and wished the town search would show apples or something else. Judy Baldasaro wrote on her Facebook page Monday that she had sent two more requests to Google asking for her wedding photo to be taken down. She had also previously requested the photo be removed after the first time it appeared. An online Google video on YouTube stated the company takes its requests to remove content very seriously, especially if there are any potential legal issues. "If it violates our guidelines, we take it down," the video stated. "We work hard to respond fairly and accurately to legal and community concerns." Smith said there isn't much else to do as long as people are clicking on the photo or accompanying media stories that continue to make the picture popular. He said there are many great choices for a photo that could be used instead to put Londonderry in the spotlight when people search the community through Google. "I'd love to see the band, or an apple orchard, or even the airport," Smith said. "Something that is more representative of the community." For Baldasaro, he said life goes on. "And I'm not going to lose sleep over it," he said.  Tags Photo Internet Computer Science Software Google Image Search Al Baldasaro Judy Baldasaro Kevin Smith We have recently upgraded our commenting system.

Google made the March patches available six weeks ago, but they're only now rolling out to two of Samsung's handsets on T-Mobile in the US. T-Mo has released new firmware updates for the Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge. Each update is around 130MB in size, and bumps the Note 4's firmware version up to N910TUVU2EQC1, and that of the Note Edge up to N915TUVU2DQC1. In addition to the March security patches - which bring fixes for dozens of vulnerabilities in Android, and some unique to Galaxy devices - they also include "various system improvements". Both handsets remain on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, and are not in line for an upgrade to Android 7.0 Nougat. Bear in mind that it can take some time for over-the-air updates like these to roll out to all handsets, so if you don't see the patches available for your handset immediately, it hopefully won't be too long before they arrive.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 68 Share on Twitter Total Shares190 Applications Google News Update 1: 2017/04/18 9:22am PDT Looks like recordings from that period are appearing back where they should, nothing to see here. Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? Android Developer Yes, please upvote it. You can also create your own suggestions and bug reports there. Just remember to fill all the needed information, and add video/images when possible. Speaking of normal calls, I even requested to show larger image of the contact (because currently it's very small), but they rejected it: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705104 :( aRvInD Ok, but how to upvote? I couldn't find any arrow marks to do it..! Android Developer You just press on the star icon on the left of the title: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/202f8e6fda93b600e49e3ff09414330dc50a6535e482df680ca66861015e1a45.png . You can also comment if you want to add something to what's written, but this doesn't count as upvoting. It's too bad the current UI of the website doesn't allow (or at least I can't find how to do it) to filter by requests. I'm sure many requests of developers and users can be interesting to upvote. Here's another one I made of a basic feature of a phone: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37310901 It's to handle the annoying notifications of phone (audio) messages people leave you, and you have to call in order to listen and delete them. I prefer it all being managed on the smartphone itself. MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV. Andromedo I did this in 2012, it was painless. I have had things get "weird" during porting NOT involving Google Voice (i.e. between the "major" carriers). Once you get the appropriate people on the phone, they've always been able to "save" it -- for what it is worth, I know AT&T has a dedicated port department that works out of the United States and they are quite capable. I imagine if you had any trouble getting it to Google, you could call Verizon, and swear that you were never going to leave them if they'd just put it back the way it was. You should be fine. Elaine L So that's what the problem was! I thought it was user error and lo, though I tried, I couldn't find those voice mails. Thanks, yer Mum. MisterAlex I haven't been able to record a Google Voice call in ages. You're supposed to just be able to press 4 during a call, right? Is it because I use Hangouts for my calls?

Name: Subject: Message: Google Assistant’s speech recognition API is now open to all developers Android Development Newsby John Callaham8 hours ago 278 11 The same tools that handle the speech recognition features in Google Assistant can now be used by a larger audience. The Google Cloud Speech API, which went into open beta in the summer of 2016, is now generally available for all third-party developers. See also: How to set up payments and shop with Google Assistant on Google Home February 16, 2017 Google says that the Cloud Speech API can recognize over 80 languages and variants. Developers can, among other things, create products and services using those tools to transcribe the text of users who speak into a microphone. In fact, you can do a quick demo of that feature over on the Google Speech API page. In addition, the API allows developers to enable voice commands for apps and services, along with transcribing audio files. Google says that since the open beta for the API started last year, thousands of customers have used it, and their access to the open beta allowed Google to add many improvements. That includes better transcription accuracy for longer audio files, faster processing time, and the support of more file formats such as WAV, Opus, and Speex. Google offered some examples of how the Cloud Speech API has been implemented by businesses. One of them, Japan’s Clarion, uses it for in-car navigation and entertainment systems. It says that, combined with the use of the Google Places API, it allows customers to get to their destinations safely. The Houston, Texas-based InteractiveTel also uses the Cloud Speech API to get almost real-time transcriptions of their dealers’ chats with customers. The company says these transcriptions have helped them to increase sales.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 19 April 2017 | MYT 6:30 AM Google Earth re-invented for new era Google Earth is getting an update. — Google Earth Google launched a re-imagined version of its free Earth mapping service, weaving in storytelling and artificial intelligence and freeing it from apps.  "This is our gift to the world," Google Earth director Rebecca Moore said while giving AFP an early look at the new version of the program that lets people range the planet from the comfort of their computers, smartphones or tablets.  "It's a product that speaks to our deepest values around education and making information available to people."  A new 'Voyager' feature enables people digitally exploring the planet to be guided on interactive stories told by experts, boasting partners including BBC Earth, NASA, Sesame Street, and the Jane Goodall Institute.  Google artificial intelligence will be put to work for Earth users in the form of "knowledge cards" that let them dive deeper into online information about mountains, countries, landmarks or other places being virtually visited.  It will also make suggestions on other locations armchair explorers might be interested in exploring based on what they have searched in the past.  "This is the first time we have done this deep integration with the Google Knowledge Graph," Earth engineering manager Sean Askay said.  "Everything Google knows about the world, you can know about the world."  There is also a newly installed "Feeling Lucky?" feature for people who want to let the software suggest hidden gems such as Pemba Island off the Swahili coast or the Oodaira Hot Spring in Yamagata, Japan.  People can choose to fly around the world in Earth, using a 3D button to see the Grand Canyon, Chateau Loire Valley and other stunning spots from any angles they wish.  "With the new Earth, we want to open up different lenses for you to see the world and learn a bit about how it all fits together; to open your mind with new stories while giving you a new perspective on the locations and experiences you cherish," Earth product manager Gopal Shah said in a blog post.  Online explorers cruising the mobile version of Earth can also capture pictures on their travels, sending friends digital postcards.  New Earth was launched on Google's Chrome and Android software, with versions tailored for Apple devices and other internet browsing software promised soon.  It's the first time that Earth can be reached on a web browser instead of through applications installed on devices.  The move allows Google to tap into more powerful computing power at datacentres in the Internet "cloud" instead of relying on the capabilities of smartphones and other devices. — AFP Related Stories You May Be Interested Germany’s VCs hunt for software startups as Berlin loses crown Hackers exploit Japan’s mobile gamers with fake fantasy cash The driverless future: Where is artificial intelligence taking us?

A central feature in the new Google Earth is Voyager. Google has partnered with such groups as the BBC and NASA to add video clips, photos and text narratives to three-dimensional representations of particular locations. The Jane Goodall Institute, for instance, lets you journey to spots in Tanzania that inspired its founding chimpanzee expert. You can also get overlays of chimpanzee ranges and compare imagery from 2005 and 2014 to see the effects of forest restoration efforts. Today we’re introducing a brand-new version of Google Earth—on the web and Android. Meet the new #GoogleEarth https://t.co/YRht2zbtfx pic.twitter.com/YCcUmgcufV — googleearth (@googleearth) April 18, 2017 The producers of "Sesame Street'' show off Muppets from co-productions around the world; the map shows where the Muppets live and offer stories about the region and its culture. Separately, a new "I'm Feeling Lucky'' feature takes you to a location selected at random. Google Earth is highlighting some 20,000 lesser-known destinations — the kinds of places locals might frequent or know about, such as the Indonesian island of Bunaken, part of a national marine park. Google Earth used to be the place to go to for satellite views and 3-D images stitched together from aerial fly-bys. A software download was required, limiting its use. Google Maps has incorporated many of those features, making Google Earth even less necessary. People look at a Google Earth map on a screen as Google Earth unveils the revamped version of the application on Tuesday. (Photo: Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty) Tuesday's update is about giving you a reason to use Google Earth again. Google says that while Maps is about getting you to a destination, Earth is about immersing you there, or "getting lost.'' With the update, Google Earth now works on Google's Chrome browsers for desktops. It still requires an app for phones and tablets because of the heavy graphics involved; Google is rolling out updates for Android, but there's no Google Earth app for iPhones or iPads yet. After months of hard work, I'm proud to have just launched Google Earth VR on Oculus Rift with search! #GoogleEarth #VR #OculusRift pic.twitter.com/e0Hs28CrNQ — Andre Le (@Andre_Le) April 18, 2017 Some older features will still require a software download on desktops. That includes maps of Mars and the moon through a partnership with NASA. Google also announced an update to a virtual-reality version of Google Earth. It now works with Facebook's Oculus Rift, not just the HTC Vive. But it won't work with cheaper, phone-based VR systems, such as Google's Daydream and Samsung's Gear VR.

Share on Facebook Are you an influencer? ﻿ Advertisements 5 Just a few days before Earth Day, which falls on April 22 this year, Google reintroduced Google Earth for Chrome and Android. The exclusively redesigned extension can now run directly from Chrome, without having to download a separate piece of software. Earth was first released 15 years ago in June 2001 as a free app with limited functionality, and as a paid version, Earth Pro, which is now accessible for free. Advertisements New features, guided tours, and 3D details The redesigned Earth exploration map for Google has some new features that were not found in the original version of the #Mapping Service. With the new Voyager feature, Google takes us on a journey to explore the world through interactive guided tours that were created by storytellers, such as scientists and non-profit organizations. Through collections such as “Museums Around the World," Google will explore 28 museums all around the world in Street View. Each knowledge card presents information in digestible chunks, and links to find more information about the places on Google Arts & Culture. In addition to the 2D aerial imagery, Google Earth now has 3D images of the Earth’s terrain, buildings, and other places of interests. To present more fresh content in the collections, Google is partnering with content providers such as Sesame Street, artists, and other content providers such as BBC Worldwide. Google Earth now even has the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button represented by an icon of a die, positioned just below the Voyager icon. Clicking on it will take us to a random location on the planet. The stunning detailed 3D view enriches the experience by presenting a location’s beauty and richness in a way that is far more interesting than the flat and blurry 2D view. Users can also send out "postcards" through their social media accounts from any location with the Share Link feature. Google Earth Pro and free This redesigned version comes just after the service began using images obtained directly from NASA satellites to compile a better and sharper view of places on the planet. A few years ago, the tech giant decided to stop charging users of its Google Earth Pro, which used to cost hundreds of dollars. The company’s mapping innovation includes other services, such as Google Sky, Google Maps, and Google Earth Virtual Reality (VR) that is a Chrome experience of Earth in #virtual reality, which can be enjoyed with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Discover the entire world from a new perspective. This is the new #GoogleEarth. https://t.co/HTbi4yjGsM pic.twitter.com/Dsja4GDCqc— googleearth (@googleearth) April 18, 2017 Microsoft Surface Phone not part of May event, possible features revealed Liez Carlisle Is the 'Assassin's Creed Empire' release date coming soon?

Just in time for Earth Day 2017, tech giant Google debuted a brand new version of its virtual explorer program, Google Earth, packed with a multitude of exciting new features. » RELATED: 7 jobs you can get at Google Atlanta right now "We want to open up different lenses for you to see the world and learn a bit about how it all fits together; to open your mind with new stories while giving you a new perspective on the locations and experiences you cherish," Google product manager Gopal Shah wrote in a blog post Tuesday. Here’s what you can expect from the new version: Voyager: Interactive, informative and fun guided tours Google The new Voyager feature allows you to go on interactive guided tours with the help of “some of the world’s leading storytellers, scientists and nonprofits,” Shah wrote. For example, you can  use the feature to go on a tour of Tanzania’s Gombe National Park and learn about chimpanzee research and conservation efforts from Jane Goodall herself. Or journey to Earth’s major habitats — islands, mountains, deserts, jungles and more — to learn about the wildlife in each with guidance from experts at BBC Earth. » RELATED: The new Google Maps tracker will ruin your lies about being late You can even make a stop in Mexico to meet one of Sesame Street’s Girl Muppets Around the World, Lola, and learn about modern Mayan cultures or see what traditional homes from cultures around the world look like in a special Voyager story called This is Home. According to Shah, Voyager includes more than 50 different immersive stories with more added on a weekly basis. “I’m feeling lucky” button: See where the world takes you with the click of a button The new “I’m feeling lucky” Google Earth button could throw you into the depths of the Amazon rainforest, the Zao Hot Spring in Japan or one of the other 20,000 curated places around the globe. At any given place, you can open a Knowledge Card and view images, learn about the history and more. » RELATED: Want a job at Google? Consider going to this Georgia school 3D button: See any place from any angle A new 3D button appears in the corner wherever you (virtually) are, so you can take in drone’s-eye views of the the world’s marvels. For example, Shah wrote, you may choose to uncover the awe-inspiring architecture of the Château de Chambord in France’s Loire Valley or perhaps plunge into the depths of the Grand Canyon’s geological layers. Postcards: Share the beauty you stumble upon with loved ones This new feature allows you to share your favorite Google Earth finds with family and friends. Share a Postcard and your loved ones will be able to click on the link and immerse themselves, too. According to Shah, the new Google Earth is now available on the web in your Chrome browser. This week, it will roll out on Android devices and will be available on iOS and other browsers in the “near future.” More at blog.google.com.

Some Google Wifis randomly stop working, turn solid blue Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/17 5:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 3 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares81 Bug Watch Google Wifi News If your Google Wifi seems to be looking a bit blue these days — as in, the light is stuck blue — you might want to check to see if it's still actually functioning. The current build for it (9202.35.8) seems to be causing issues for some users. You probably know if you've been affected since, well, your Google Wifi won't be working. Other means of detection and confirmation manifest themselves via a steady blue light on the primary hub, at which point the satellite hubs may start to flash orange signifying a disconnect of the primary hub. In the meantime it seems that restarting that primary hub fixes the issue, but only temporarily. To be very clear, this is not a universal problem. It could be related to the latest build (9202.35.8). Even then, not all users are reporting this, and the precise nature of the cause has not been reported. But, a reasonably large number of individuals on Google's forums have been experiencing this particular issue. Google has responded on the forum with some information, reassurance, and instructions for those affected, saying, "Our team is still looking into this and working hard on getting a fix out-- we aim to have it out as soon as possible." More information for those who find they may be experiencing this problem is available below: The engineering team is still working on a final fix for this issue. However, over the past few days our support team has seen two workarounds that make help resolve the issue temporarily until the fix is released. These have worked in a few cases, and may be worth a try. 1. Attempt to setup GWifi from scratch using a different owner account. This can mean creating a new Google account, or using a family member's Google account to setup the Google Wifi devices through the GW app. 2. Disconnect wireless Windows 10 devices or Xbox devices (or connect them via ethernet instead). There have been a few cases in which disconnecting any Windows 10 devices or Xbox devices has brought the Google Wifi network back up again without crashes. You can also reach out to our support team (g.co/wificare or wifica...@google.com), who will be able to provide more deep-dive troubleshooting advice based on the topography of your network. As always, thank you for your patience while we work on this issue. Both of the potential fixes at this time seem a bit unfortunate; neither having to switch to a new google account nor giving up using a Windows 10 device sound very great, but hopefully Google will have things solved quickly.

This is why I stay away from a majority of Google hardware. T_Dizzle More like disconnect Google WiFi and use your old router till they get their stuff together. Kevin Davis Absolutely correct. 4Ui812 Google is aiming for continuity by breaking all of their products. berto1014 No kidding, sounds like their QA/QC lately is borderline nonexistent. TeutonJon78 Lately? It's been downhill since KK. Jilljsantana Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Ra1nb0wD4sh DE KitKat JD "Ok Google What is QA or Quality Assurance" *Google Home explodes* - Because Google. whispy_snippet For goodness sake. Because WiFi wasn't already annoying enough. Leif Sikorski Service, testing and quality control ... something Google likes to fail at. They save money on the wrong end and that's why they'll never be a big competing hardware company. catalysto Apple products get bugs like this, too. dan At least when apple breaks something like fingerprint readers it's by design. Cecil Hardwood As an Apple fan I can say...Nope. Cecil Hardwood As an Apple fan I can say...Yup. MJ "Attempt to setup GWifi from scratch using a different owner account. This can mean creating a new Google account, or using a family member's Google account to setup the Google Wifi devices through the GW app." WTF? A factory reset won't work but using a different Google account will? Does this concern anyone? There is ZERO reason to have a/your Google account tied to a piece of hardware like a router. This is your second warning. This was the first --> http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/23/google-onhub-wifi-units-randomly-dying-people-requiring-factory-resets/ 😆😄 Not concerning at all. The Google account just acts as the intermediary for the OAuth2 tokens that the app and the devices use to share data. Would you rather sign in with a login/pass every time you open the Google Wifi app instead? MJ Not concerning at all? We have already had one incident where the Google Accounts engine reset people's routers and another incident where using the original Google account that setup can't be used to fix a problem. Yes! I rather use a login/password local to router itself to logon. I have always owned my router and never had the need to use an "app" to access it. LOL The couple of times I need to change a setting on my router a year my PC is a better tool to do that. 😆😄 Sounds like Google Wifi is not for you, then. I love it personally! 😃 ericshmerick Bah, let MJ make everyone feel as if the sky is falling!!!11!11 😆😄 Yeah, his comments are great... they remind me of this speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwMVMbmQBug 4Ui812 Just " Google it " is said among people when they need information. When their phone or other hardware has issues people will start saying "it's Googled" . 4Ui812 Does Google search know what's wrong with Google's hardware/software or should people just Bing it ? Deeco Google has the worst quality control ever from why company. Ryan Moving the functionality to Google Express JD Ok Google remind me to buy internets today. robertlwalters This killed my Asus OnHub AD1980 There's that high quality we've come to expect from Google products charles anderson I was doing some test on one of my onhubs earlier and once I reset it on this build that was it it would no longer work I couldn't reset it at all or reconnect to it it also wouldn't get an IP address from my ISP at all so there's that.🤔 sbeaulieu Fuck. Come on Google. Lare2 This is whats happens when Google wants to apply their philosophy of iterate fast to infrastructure equipment where you need rock solid stability. Get your act together Google, this is not a freaking gadget you can just push new stuff to it and wait to see what happens. Geeeez Bruce Wayne Very few things come out of this company that don't break down and have issues. They should focus on improving their current crop of products and services rather than rushing things out and implementing poor quality control. Maxr1998 Nothing unexpected for me, when does Google ever release a product without bugs? Anyway, I don't care, I don't have a Google Wifi - I'm only here for the header image 😂😂 abc To be fair, sometimes issues happen with beta products. JD But all of Google's products are Beta.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/50758a6dc716e75ca6f3916119d1cc1b658a0397c96802c00519ce51490d09e5.jpg Luxferro The perfect example why you shouldn't buy these manufacturer managed routers. UniBroW Glad I held off on getting these for my father who rents out his condo down south to vacationers. This would be a nightmare YaKillaCJ I'm going to need Microsoft to get it together. Yes, I know this is about Google. However it's well documented that Xbox has issues specifically with many cable routers. Routers that are default to Comcast. Thus midway of playing a match online or watching say Netflix, you will be randomly signed out of Xbox Live. Even though your Internet, connection & speed hasn't dropped. The only fix is to get another router (aftermarket) and turn your cable router into bridge mode effectively turning it into just a modem. JD So Some kind of Comcast router problem.... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm telling you. You need to run a "Google Screwup Of The Day" series. Perico Lospalotes I am done buying google devices, The Chromecast mediocre due to the totally worthless app you must use on the phone (Fire stick kicks its but any day of the week and twice on sunday), Google Home 1 answer out of 5, Pixel, o don't make me start on Pixel. They do not know how to make and back up with CS their electronics. JD Shit like this is why I don't buy Google Products. Especially products that are responsible for my Wifi/Internet. When shit doesn't work I go online and Google it, but now Google Hardware is why I can't Go online to Google why my Google hardware doesn't work. #Googleception Nexus Hexus LOL!

Google has been collecting this information for years at this point, but if the idea that Google has a record of your whereabouts bothers you, you can always turn the feature off. Weve certainly referred to the timeline when we cant recall the name of a restaurant or if we were trying to recall how something went down on a particular day. Timeline menu and filtering You can access the Timeline by opening Google Maps on your iOS device and tapping on Your timeline. You can even filter the timeline by activity to only show you when you drove, or walked, or flew, or even when you were out catching Pokémon. You can also ask Google to send your monthly summary emails of the places visited that month. To access these settings, open the settings tab within the Timeline screen. Just know that the only person who can see this information is you, if you dont want anyone peeping at your location history or Google Photos backups, make sure you keep your Google account secure. Google has so much of our information nowadays, it is certainly a good idea to keep your personal Gmail account password out of the wrong hands.

Released by University of California - San Diego   Go to mobile page. A partnership between computer scientists at the University of California San Diego and Google has allowed the search giant to reduce by 70 percent fraudulent business listings in Google Maps. The researchers worked together to analyze more than 100,000 fraudulent listings to determine how scammers had been able to avoid detection -- albeit for a limited amount of time -- and how they made money. The team presented their findings at the 26th International Conference on the World Wide Web in Australia earlier this month. The computer scientists identified what they describe as a "new form of blackhat search engine optimization that targets local listing services" such as Google Maps. They also describe how these scammers were able to make money. "Location-based search is increasingly becoming the way people interact with online content--even if you're not using a mapping application," said Alex C. Snoeren, a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego and a senior author of the study. For example, when people run a search on their mobile phone, the search engine uses their physical location as one of the inputs to decide which results to display, Snoeren explained. The scammers take advantage of this by using fake locations to make it look like their business is in close proximity to the user doing the search. This was particularly true of on-call contractors, notably plumbers and locksmiths. Researchers found that 40 percent of all fake listings on Google Maps belong to that category. "I might find seven listings for locksmiths in my neighborhood," said Danny Huang, the paper's first author and a Ph.D. student in computer science at the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego. "But in fact, none of those listings are real." In all, researchers found that 11 percent of overall search results for locksmiths were fraudulent. In New York, that percentage went up to 15.6 percent. And it went up to an astonishing 83.3 percent in West Harrison, New York. Scammers are able to make money when they get called to help a user based on a fake listing. Scammers might quote a low price when called on the phone, only to charge a higher fee when they show up. They might not be licensed but get the business anyway. In another scheme, scammers set up fake pins for real hotels or restaurants on Google Maps. They set up websites where customers make reservations, which are connected to the business' real website or to a travel agency, which is not part of the scam. This allows scammers to make money either by getting a commission for each reservation or for referring traffic to the businesses' real websites. The researchers found that roughly 13 percent of the fraudulent listings had real hotel and restaurant addresses, but were not created by these businesses. All these fraud schemes were possible primarily because scammers found a way to get around Google's verification process. Businesses can register for Google Maps online for free. But before a listing goes live, Google sends a postcard with a verification code to the business' address. The business inputs this verification code and the listing is then approved to go live. Partly thanks to these measures, Google is able to detect 85 percent of fake listings before they even appear on Google Maps. The fake listings that make it past the verification process are taken down within an average of 8.6 days between creation and suspension. Scammers got around verification requirements mainly by leasing PO boxes and using those addresses to receive their verification codes. They also added fake suite numbers to a specific address so Google wouldn't get suspicious about a large number of businesses located at the same address. Researchers note that there are legitimate reasons for a large number of businesses to have the same address--big office buildings in Manhattan come to mind. Researchers also noted that a large percent of fraudulent listings changed their address or the category they belonged to (from hotel to locksmith, for example) after verification. To tamp down on abuse, Google has taken a number of measures, which the company details in a post on its research blog. Steps include: prohibiting bulk registration at most addresses; preventing businesses from changing their addresses to a location that is impossibly far from the original without additional verification; and detecting and ignoring intentionally mangled text in address fields designed to confuse Google's algorithms. The company also fine-tuned its anti-spam machine learning systems to detect data discrepancies that are common in fake or deceptive listings. The above story is based on materials provided by University of California - San Diego.Translate this page: Chinese French German Italian Japanese Korean Portuguese Russian Spanish Related » Zhang  2/18/14  Crowdsourced Testers Prefer New Cyber Search Method Computer scientists at Case Western Reserve University have developed a new tool to search and fetch electronic files that  Engine  8/25/14  Organic Vs.

(AP) — If you didn't know better, you might think this New Hampshire town is best known for gun-toting wedding parties. A Google search for the town of Londonderry has repeatedly turned up a wedding photo of resident and Republican state Rep. Al Baldasaro with five women, including the bride, posing with rifles while wearing their wedding attire. Town Manager Kevin Smith said the photo appeared earlier this year, prompting the town to send a letter in February to Google asking for it to be removed. That seemed to do the trick but then the photo resurfaced again this week, prompting the town to reach out to Google again. The latest image was a near-duplicate of the one that was removed earlier this year, and was posted on a different page. This new image was pulled into Google's Knowledge Panel algorithmically. By Tuesday afternoon, the wedding photo had been replaced by a town map. Rather than a family wedding photo, Smith would prefer the town get noticed for its apple orchards, accomplished high school band that has marched in four Tournament of Roses parades, or its status as home to Manchester-Boston Regional Airport. "It's not that we take great exception with the photo. It's that we don't think that it's representative of the town," Smith said. "Well, we think there are so many other images that represent the town more fairly, and we have named then in the letters we have sent to Google." In its letter to Google, the town's attorney claimed critics of Baldasaro raised the profile of the photo by sharing it numerous times on social media, hoping it would have been deemed embarrassing enough to help defeat Baldasaro last November. Google confirmed the image had been removed. Baldasaro, who won re-election and was an early supporter of President Donald Trump, said he agrees the photo should not represent the town. He said his wife, Judy, had written to Google on Monday night to request that it decouple the photo from the town's biographical information. "My picture has no business being up there," he said Tuesday. "But I've got no control over it. I just found out yesterday it was up there again." But he insisted there was nothing inherently wrong with the photo — which he says was his wife's idea and was taken as a joke after a fellow legislator showed up at his wedding with his guns.

In fact, they don’t mention McDonald’s at all — though they do mention Coca-Cola and Google. The ads are part of the chain’s first unbranded marketing campaign, in which it coyly asks people to search Google for “that place where Coke tastes so good.” In a tweet, Kaling asked to be paid in fries. I quit An Uber executive who worked on the self-driving vehicle program has left the firm, the latest in a string of departures. The company confirmed that Sherif Marakby, a vice president who joined the company a year ago, left Monday. Uber said Marakby’s departure was not related to a lawsuit by Waymo, Google’s self-driving vehicle spinoff, which alleges that Uber is using Waymo trade secrets smuggled away by a former employee. Unicorn is the new black TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Business news first: Sign in for newsletters Starbucks is calling a limited-time beverage that changes colors and flavors with a stir of the straw a Unicorn Frappuccino. The chain says the drink, which starts out purple with a sweet and fruity taste, then changes to blue with a tart flavor, was inspired by the trend of unicorn-themed food online. Nadia Cakes, a Minnesota bakery, ships unicorn-sprinkle cupcakes nationwide, for example, and there are more rainbow recipes on Pinterest. The Starbucks concoction will be available through April 23 in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The 12-ounce size has 280 calories. From San Francisco Chronicle staff and news services.

By AFP Tuesday 18 Apr 2017, 10:31 PM 9 hours ago 9,656 Views 9 Comments http://jrnl.ie/3346201 Share Tweet Email3 Source: Google/YouTube GOOGLE HAS LAUNCHED a re-imagined version of its free Earth mapping service, weaving in storytelling and artificial intelligence and freeing it from apps. “This is our gift to the world,” Google Earth director Rebecca Moore said while giving AFP an early look at the new version of the program that lets people range the planet from the comfort of their computers, smartphones or tablets. “It’s a product that speaks to our deepest values around education and making information available to people.” A new ‘Voyager’ feature enables people digitally exploring the planet to be guided on interactive stories told by experts, boasting partners including BBC Earth, NASA, Sesame Street, and the Jane Goodall Institute. Google artificial intelligence will be put to work for Earth users in the form of “knowledge cards” that let them dive deeper into online information about mountains, countries, landmarks or other places being virtually visited. It will also make suggestions on other locations armchair explorers might be interested in based on what they have searched in the past. “This is the first time we have done this deep integration with the Google Knowledge Graph,” Earth engineering manager Sean Askay said. Everything Google knows about the world, you can know about the world. There is also a newly installed “Feeling Lucky?” feature for people who want to let the software suggest hidden gems such as Pemba Island off the Swahili coast or the Oodaira Hot Spring in Yamagata, Japan. People can choose to fly around the world in Earth, using a 3-D button to see the Grand Canyon, chateaux of the Loire Valley and other stunning spots from any angles they wish. “Because we’re doing a lot of the computing in the cloud, it allows you to have Google Earth right on your phone, so you can literally carry the whole world in your pocket,” Earth product manager Gopal Shah told AFP at the New York launch. “The new version of Google Earth is really about education, it’s really about immersing yourself in places you haven’t been before to get a little bit of an exposure,” he added. Online explorers cruising the mobile version of Earth can also capture pictures on their travels, sending friends digital postcards. New Earth was launched on Google’s Chrome and Android software, with versions tailored for Apple devices and other internet browsing software promised soon. It’s the first time that Earth can be reached on a web browser instead of through applications installed on devices. The move allows Google to tap into more powerful computing power at data centers in the internet “cloud” instead of relying on the capabilities of smartphones and other devices. © – AFP, 2017 Read: New wireless cameras to revolutionise care of premature babies Read: Here’s what you need to know about Eir’s record fine from the telecoms watchdog Get breaking news from TheJournal.ie via Facebook.

Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The new Timeline feature is accessible from the slide out menu in Google Maps for iOS and staring today, you should see the new “Your Timeline” option in the menu. Tapping it will allow you to easily view the places you have visited over recent days, weeks, and months. Google explains that the information in the Timeline interface is easily customizable, allowing you to change things such as names and addresses to ensure that everything is as accurate as possible. As you can see in the screenshots above and below, the Timeline feature presents your visited places in a place-by-place method. You can view the places on a map, while you can also see the total distance you traveled and by what method you traveled (driving, walking, etc). Here’s how Google explains the Your Timeline feature: What was the name of that antique store I popped into the other day? Where was that coffee shop we discovered on our last vacation? Did I drop off the dry cleaning on Tuesday or Wednesday? Answering questions like these used to take some guesswork (and a great memory). But with Your Timeline on Google Maps, Android and desktop users could quickly revisit the things they’ve done and places they’ve been. Starting today, Google Maps users on iOS can join in on the fun and see a daily snapshot of their life as well. In addition to viewing visited places in the Timeline menu, users will also now see visit information on the individual place cards of locations or businesses. For instance, if you look at details about an Apple Store in Google Maps that you’ve previously visited, you’ll see details such as the date and time of those previous visits. The rollout of Your Timeline to Google Maps on iOS appears to be a gradual, server-side update as I have it on one of my devices, but not others. Download the latest version of the app from the App Store to ensure you receive the new feature as soon as possible, though.

Reuters PayPal has been setting up agreements with banks, credit card issuers and wireless carriers to convert PayPal from a payments button on websites into a versatile financial tool used to make payments in stores, transfer money overseas and shop from smartphones on the go. By Bloomberg News Apr 18, 2017 at 3:40 pm | Print View PayPal and Alphabet’s Google deepened their relationship with a new agreement that enables payments through the tap of a phone from PayPal accounts at thousands of new retail locations. The partnership lets PayPal users link their accounts to Android Pay, Google’s digital wallet, on smartphones running most versions of the Android operating system. This makes PayPal a funding option when people use Android Pay in locations including Walgreens Boots Alliance drugstores and Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants. PayPal was added as a payment method for Google’s Play app and digital content store almost three years ago. PayPal CEO Dan Schulman has been busy cutting deals with banks, credit card issuers and wireless carriers to convert PayPal from a payments button on websites into a versatile financial tool used to make payments in stores, transfer money overseas and shop from smartphones on the go. The Android Pay deal increases PayPal’s reach in stores, which Schulman sees as key to getting customers to use PayPal more frequently than the current average of two to three transactions per month. “This is the next logical step in our desire to partner with everyone in the ecosystem,” said Aunkur Arya, senior vice president at PayPal unit Braintree, which enabled the Android Pay tie-up. “These partnerships don’t happen unless there’s value for both sides.” One big challenge remains — PayPal accounts can’t link to Apple Inc.’s digital wallet, Apple Pay. The stronger relationship between Google and PayPal could rekindle speculation about an acquisition. PayPal split from parent company eBay Inc. two years ago, prompting hope it could be a target of tech companies or financial institutions looking to enter the digital payments industry. PayPal processed $354 billion in payments through 197 million active customers in 2016. Like what you're reading?

McDonald’s Creates Clickbait TV Ad That Mentions Google, Coke, But Not McDonald’s Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share McDonald’s Creates Clickbait TV Ad That Mentions Google, Coke, But Not McDonald’s Image courtesy of McDonald's | YouTube April 18, 2017 4:10 pm EDT By Kate Cox@kcoxdc advertising burger king mcdonald's outsourcing An actress in a yellow dress stands in front of a red curtain. She tells you about Coke and about Google, but it’s not a commercial for either of those things… and you’ll have to search a catch phrase to find out what it is for. It is, apparently, “unbranded marketing” for McDonald’s… but will it work? The campaign started last week, the New York Times reports. In the commercials, actress Mindy Kaling asks viewers to search Google for “that place where Coke tastes so good.” The idea is that doing so will lead you to discover that Coke apparently tastes so good at McDonald’s. The ads don’t mention the restaurant chain’s name anywhere. It’s part of their first “unbranded marketing campaign,” the Times writes. And that probably feels strange, since usually the point of advertising is to, y’know, promote a brand. The goal is to reach teenaged and twenty-something viewers of TV (i.e. everyone’s favorite marketing demographic du jour, young millennials) in the place where they live: their phones. Young viewers almost certainly have a device to hand while watching their favorite shows, and can perhaps be persuaded to engage by Googling. The commercial almost like advertising as clickbait. Not in the “one weird trick” sense we’ve all grown inured to online, but rather, a TV ad that barely hints at what it’s for and instead, convices you to go search a catch phrase. It’s impossible to avoid comparing McDonald’s “oh please go look this up” approach with the tactic Burger King took earlier this month of trying to force Google Home devices to engage and tell their owners about Whoppers. In both cases, the ad is outsourcing a lot of the drudge work of conveying details to Google and the viewer. In McDonald’s case, though, the ad is trying to convince you to act on normal curiosity. In BK’s case, it was trying to turn your tech into an advertising accomplice. (Google disabled the ad from triggering its Home devices within a day.) The company says it has no plans to game the results. “Google didn’t give us any tricks on search or anything,” McDonald’s chief marketing officer in the U.S. told the NYT. What they’re helping us do is understand if people are really searching as a result of this, and offering close feedback and collaboration in terms of what’s happening with this with real behavior,” she continued. But the McDonald’s campaign is subject to the same challenge of any ad campaign that relies on the general world of search or social media to function, though: People like to screw with stuff. McDonald’s itself learned the perils of hashtag campaigns back in 2014, for example. So if McDonald’s isn’t planning to push the “right” results, are they prepared for jokesters to try to promote the “wrong” ones? The CMO told the Times that they are prepared for people to try to mess with the results, which seems like an inevitability. But, she added, they are expecting a positive reaction given that people apparently already have positive feelings about Coke and McDonald’s. But will seeing Mindy Kaling in McD’s trademark red and yellow be enough to convince viewers they need to go get some McNuggets and a Coke, or will they just shrug and start brigading some less savory search result instead?

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint NEW YORK – Google Earth is getting a revival, as the 3-D mapping service reorients itself to become more of a tool for adventure and exploration. A central feature in the new Google Earth is Voyager. Google has partnered with such groups as the BBC and NASA to add video clips, photos and text narratives to three-dimensional representations of particular locations. The Jane Goodall Institute, for instance, lets you journey to spots in Tanzania that inspired its founding chimpanzee expert. You can also get overlays of chimpanzee ranges and compare imagery from 2005 and 2014 to see the effects of forest restoration efforts. The producers of "Sesame Street" show off Muppets from co-productions around the world; the map shows where the Muppets live and offer stories about the region and its culture. Separately, a new "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature takes you to a location selected at random. Google Earth is highlighting some 20,000 lesser-known destinations — the kinds of places locals might frequent or know about, such as the Indonesian island of Bunaken, part of a national marine park. Google Earth used to be the place to go to for satellite views and 3-D images stitched together from aerial fly-bys. A software download was required, limiting its use. Google Maps has incorporated many of those features, making Google Earth even less necessary. Tuesday's update is about giving you a reason to use Google Earth again. Google said that while Maps is about getting you to a destination, Earth is about immersing you there, or "getting lost." With the update, Google Earth now works on Google's Chrome browsers for desktops. It still requires an app for phones and tablets because of the heavy graphics involved; Google is rolling out updates for Android, but there's no Google Earth app for iPhones or iPads yet. Some older features will still require a software download on desktops. That includes maps of Mars and the moon through a partnership with NASA. Google also announced an update to a virtual-reality version of Google Earth. It now works with Facebook's Oculus Rift, not just the HTC Vive. But it won't work with cheaper, phone-based VR systems, such as Google's Daydream and Samsung's Gear VR.

Lutron Announces Alliance with Google Home to Power Home Lighting Systems Using Voice-Activated Google Assistant Wondering If You Left Your Lights On? Just Ask Google April 18, 2017 04:33 PM Eastern Daylight Time COOPERSBURG, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lutron Electronics today announced a new integration with Google Home that allows homeowners to easily control their Lutron Caséta Wireless, RadioRA 2 and HomeWorks QS lighting systems using the Google Assistant, offering greater flexibility and peace of mind.

This latest integration with the Google Assistant reinforces Lutron’s leadership in the connected home space,” said Ed Blair, Senior Vice-President at Lutron Electronics. “With Google Home’s voice-powered Google Assistant, customers can interact with and direct their connected homes easier than ever, and for today’s busy families, this service is invaluable.” Google Home, a voice-enabled speaker powered by the Google Assistant, allows you to take advantage of Google’s rich history in search by asking it any range of questions; you can also stream music and manage everyday tasks – and now, with Lutron’s new alliance, you can easily control lighting throughout the house. Getting your home party-ready when you have your hands full preparing dinner is as simple as saying, “Ok, Google, play my party playlist” and follow it up by “Ok, Google, dim the family room lights.” Your connected home will do the rest. In addition to controlling lights anywhere in the house with a simple request to the Google Assistant, you can ask Google if a particular light is on. The Google Assistant will respond and react in real time, allowing homeowners to control lights anywhere in the house. In addition to Google Home, the Google Assistant is accessible on Pixel (a phone by Google, and the first with the Google Assistant built in), select Android phones and Android Wear. With this on-the-go control, you can calm your worries of leaving the lights on and ask, “Ok, Google, are my lights on?” And when returning home, telling the Google Assistant “Ok, Google, turn on the living room lights,” means you can have a bright home waiting for you when you arrive at night. And making your home look lived in even when you’re away on vacation is simple; just say the word, and the Google Assistant on Google Home will automatically adjust Lutron lights per your command.

Facebook Twitter Google+ Email April 18, 20174:47 PM ET Malaka Gharib Twitter YouTube A dollar. That's all Esther Afua Ocloo needed to kickstart Ghana's first food processing factory in 1942. She was a college student. And she was broke. So she used the money, a gift from her aunt, to buy some oranges, sugar, firewood and jam jars. She produced 12 pots of marmalade. And Nkulenu Industries was born. She sold the jam to her classmates, then the school, then the country, then the world. Ocloo, the star of today's Google Doodle, was more than a jam star. She also became a pioneer in the field of microfinance — lending a small amount of money to women with a dream like she once had. The daily drawing, which sits just above the search bar on Google's homepage, depicts a group of women in colorful printed dresses selling citrus fruit, blankets and jam. They represent the small business owners Ocloo helped throughout her career. Ocloo, who passed away in 2002, would have celebrated her 98th birthday today. Ocloo wanted women in Ghana to be financially independent, especially women farmers and agricultural workers. Although they produced much of the food in West Africa, they weren't making enough money. "Women must know that the strongest power in the world is economic power," she said in a speech in 1990. "You cannot go and be begging to your husband for every little thing, but at the moment, that's what the majority of our women do." Early on in her career, Ocloo dreamed of starting a "women's World Bank." If she could just help low-income women access more credit and free themselves of greedy moneylenders, she believed, they could increase their profits. That's how Women's World Banking was born. The microlending group, which Ocloo cofounded in 1976, provides small loans, often as little as $50, to women in developing countries. Ocloo also taught women how to properly store food, process it and market it to customers. Her efforts earned her the Africa Prize for Leadership in 1990 and the African Entrepreneurship Award in 2001 for providing outside-the-box solutions to increasing food production in Africa. Google says its daily doodles are meant to highlight fun and surprising moments in global innovation. But there's actually a surprising twist to the topic of microfinance. Researchers have found that small loans don't necessarily have the impact we once thought. Yes, they can be helpful. But in a story about microfinance in November 2016, NPR correspondent Nurith Aizenman spoke to Dean Karlan, a professor of economics at Yale University who co-authored several microfinance studies. He told her that "the results have just not been as dramatic as was originally hoped for." But Karlan isn't too worried about the Google Doodle: "Getting people more exposed and thinking about poverty issues around the world is a good thing."

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apps Weekly: Six Best Video-Calling Apps That Work Seamlessly On Your Android Device By Zara Ali Apr 16, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Gone are the days when video-calling could be done just via desktop. With the advent of the front-facing camera on phones, developers also introduced a slew of video-calling apps that let you get in a video conversation with your loved ones. Unlike Android, iOS has its own proprietary FaceTime app that lets you connect with fellow iOS users. On Android, there are plenty of options when it comes to video-calling apps, which is why we thought about listing the best five apps that work seamlessly on your phone. Google Duo Related [UPDATE: Voice Calling Now Rolling Out Globally] Google Duo Gets Voice Call Support While Google Translate Gets ‘Definitions’ Section Google Duo is the new kid on the block, but it certainly deserves to be on top. The app has been made for seamless video calling, and with Google’s backing, it works just perfectly. The best part about Google Duo is that it lets you see a short video of the caller when he calls, this feature is known as “Knock Knock.” The video is just a snippet taken of the moment while the caller is calling you on Google Duo. This way, you get to know who is calling, no more username confusion there. Also, Google recently introduced voice calling for the app as well, which made it even niftier. To use Google Duo, all you need is a phone number. The app’s interface is the simplest of all video-calling apps. On its launch, the app surpassed Pokémon Go as the most popular app. Download Google Duo WhatsApp Related Google Duo Adds Audio-Only Call Option, Google Photos Now Uploads Photos Much Faster WhatsApp started as an instant messenger, but it stretched its feature list by adding video and voice calling functionality. The video-calling on WhatsApp is fine, but not as seamless as Google Duo. However, given the fact that most of your contacts are on WhatsApp, it just becomes easier to call them on WhatsApp. Download WhatsApp Skype We think it is convenient to call Skype – the creator of video-calling when it comes to popular adoption. We often hear that instead of saying “video-call” people end up saying “Let’s Skype.” Skype has been there for more than a decade, and it is here to stay. However, we do think that its mobile app needs to be simplified a bit. It has a lot of competitors now, but its loyal user base is not going anywhere until Skype loses its quality. Being a popular video-calling app, there are fair chances that most of your friends must be using it. Download Skype Advertisement imo imo is not a very popular video-calling app like Skype, but it is slowly gaining publicity. The best part about the app is its compatibility on 2G, 3G, 4G, and LTE networks. It means that you can video call even if you are stuck in a low connectivity area. The interface is simple, and it is not loaded with many features – just texting and calling. Give it a try if you want to video chat even in slow internet areas. Download imo Tango Tango has been there for quite some time on Android. The app has continually been upgraded, and it has got some cool features to make video-calling a fun experience. It has features like masks and avatars that are missing from many other video calling apps. So, if you are one of those who likes to add a fun element to their video-chat, then Tango is for you! Download Tango Facebook Messenger Just like WhatsApp, which also controlled by Facebook, we have Facebook Messenger offering video calling feature. It works just fine, but initially, we have had our fair share of issues when connecting to video call via Facebook Messenger. Over time, Facebook has updated its feature, and now it works well. The reason why Facebook is on this list is due to its far reaching user base, which means all of the contacts on your friend list can be contacted via video call, and you don’t even need an invitation. Just call them whenever you are up for it. Download Facebook Messenger To conclude, we would say that the quality of a video call significantly depends on the connection bandwidth, camera quality and processing power of your phone. Also, what matters is the service which is used by most of your friends. It does not matter if you find Tango to be the coolest app, but it won’t be of much use if you can’t get your friends on it, right? The Play Store is flooded with video-calling apps, and our only way to pick the best ones is by looking at their connectivity and user base.

Facebook Twitter Google+ Email April 18, 20174:47 PM ET Malaka Gharib Twitter YouTube A dollar. That's all Esther Afua Ocloo needed to kickstart Ghana's first food processing factory in 1942. She was a college student. And she was broke. So she used the money, a gift from her aunt, to buy some oranges, sugar, firewood and jam jars. She produced 12 pots of marmalade. And Nkulenu Industries was born. She sold the jam to her classmates, then the school, then the country, then the world. Ocloo, the star of today's Google Doodle, was more than a jam star. She also became a pioneer in the field of microfinance — lending a small amount of money to women with a dream like she once had. The daily drawing, which sits just above the search bar on Google's homepage, depicts a group of women in colorful printed dresses selling citrus fruit, blankets and jam. They represent the small business owners Ocloo helped throughout her career. Ocloo, who passed away in 2002, would have celebrated her 98th birthday today. Ocloo wanted women in Ghana to be financially independent, especially women farmers and agricultural workers. Although they produced much of the food in West Africa, they weren't making enough money. "Women must know that the strongest power in the world is economic power," she said in a speech in 1990. "You cannot go and be begging to your husband for every little thing, but at the moment, that's what the majority of our women do." Early on in her career, Ocloo dreamed of starting a "women's World Bank." If she could just help low-income women access more credit and free themselves of greedy moneylenders, she believed, they could increase their profits. That's how Women's World Banking was born. The microlending group, which Ocloo cofounded in 1976, provides small loans, often as little as $50, to women in developing countries. Ocloo also taught women how to properly store food, process it and market it to customers. Her efforts earned her the Africa Prize for Leadership in 1990 and the African Entrepreneurship Award in 2001 for providing outside-the-box solutions to increasing food production in Africa. Google says its daily doodles are meant to highlight fun and surprising moments in global innovation. But there's actually a surprising twist to the topic of microfinance. Researchers have found that small loans don't necessarily have the impact we once thought. Yes, they can be helpful. But in a story about microfinance in November 2016, NPR correspondent Nurith Aizenman spoke to Dean Karlan, a professor of economics at Yale University who co-authored several microfinance studies. He told her that "the results have just not been as dramatic as was originally hoped for." But Karlan isn't too worried about the Google Doodle: "Getting people more exposed and thinking about poverty issues around the world is a good thing."

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 83 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares164 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate.

No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Nope. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ?

Google is testing a new, more compact weather card Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 9:14am PDTApr 18, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 70 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares150 Google News The Google app feed (formerly known as Google Now) includes relevant bits of data from around the web and culled from your own data. One card we almost all have is weather, and Google looks to be experimenting with a new version of that one. Rather than the large card with the forecast, the new one is a single line with a few bits of relevant information. The new card shows the current conditions and forecast for the current day. The old card is much larger and includes the 5-day extended forecast. You can, of course, tap on the new card and get all that same information and more in the full weather screen. You can see the new card above and another comparison below. Left: New card, Right: Old card We've had a few reports of the new card rolling out, but it's still the larger one on all my devices. It's not clear if Google intends to make this the new default for everyone soon, or if it's still fooling around with it.

I can see the current weather on the home screen of my Pixel. The larger card is nice for glancing ahead to see if more detailed information is warranted. I'm not sure which might be more efficient though. Probably six of one, a half dozen of another. Willie Chalmers III I got this a couple of weeks ago, but it went away very quickly. I do prefer the larger one though. Did anyone else get an update to the traffic card that made it smaller? George I don't know... it seems like Google is testing all their products on us nowadays.. Can AP name one finished Google product? 7-down "Can AP name one finished Google product?" I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that. Nick Don't you know? Nothing is ever finished. In all seriousness I rather have Google A/B testing us than have stagnation in design and functionality. George true about the A/B testing... I mean, tech journalists gotta eat too, amiright?

OK, maybe Bixby has a chance. navjot This is pretty cool. Hopefully they expand it to other cards, there are some in there that take up much more space than they need to. I also hope they eventually use dark icons in the notification bar when in the Google feed, the shadow looks kinda dated, especially in screenshots. Bru [971] NOOO! I WANT THE FROG!!

Roston - Apr 18, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Lutron has announced that its connected lighting systems now work with Google Assistant, enabling users to control their home’s lights using voice commands. The new Google Assistant integration works with the company’s HomeWork QS, Caseta Wireless, and RadioRA 2; homeowners can control the system using the Google Home device or one of the Android smartphones that offers Google Assistant. The integrations will be fully available by this summer. This is the latest of many integrations we’ve seen between connected Internet of Things devices and personal assistants. In most cases, these IoT integrations are with Amazon’s Alexa, which is now facing growing competition from Google’s relatively new Assistant. Anyone familiar with controlling home items using Alexa will find it largely the same when using Alexa. If you own Lutron’s Caseta Wireless system, you’ll be able to use the new Google Assistant integration as of today — anyone with the other two aforementioned products will have to wait until this upcoming June to get the integration. Once it arrives, though, users will be able to do things like dim their home’s lights by saying, ‘OK Google, dime the living room lights.’ There are many benefits to such hands-free control; you don’t have to get out of bed to turn the light off, for example, nor do you have to walk across the room if you’re busy doing something else. Even better, this connectivity means you’ll be able to control you home’s lights even if you’re not at home (as long as there’s an Internet connection, of course), and it’ll blend seamlessly with other automated home elements that support Google Assistant.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News Lutron Announces Alliance with Google Home to Power Home Lighting Systems Using Voice-Activated Google Assistant COOPERSBURG, Pa.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Lutron Electronics today announced a new integration with Google Home that allows homeowners to easily control their Lutron Caséta Wireless, RadioRA 2 and HomeWorks QS lighting systems using the Google Assistant, offering greater flexibility and peace of mind. Now –with a few words– you can have hands-free assistance controlling lights in your connected home, whether you’re in your living room relaxing on the couch, or out of town on vacation. “Lutron continues to work with best-in-class companies to enhance our customers’ connected home experience. This latest integration with the Google Assistant reinforces Lutron’s leadership in the connected home space,” said Ed Blair, Senior Vice-President at Lutron Electronics. “With Google Home’s voice-powered Google Assistant, customers can interact with and direct their connected homes easier than ever, and for today’s busy families, this service is invaluable.” Google Home, a voice-enabled speaker powered by the Google Assistant, allows you to take advantage of Google’s rich history in search by asking it any range of questions; you can also stream music and manage everyday tasks – and now, with Lutron’s new alliance, you can easily control lighting throughout the house. Getting your home party-ready when you have your hands full preparing dinner is as simple as saying, “Ok, Google, play my party playlist” and follow it up by “Ok, Google, dim the family room lights.” Your connected home will do the rest. In addition to controlling lights anywhere in the house with a simple request to the Google Assistant, you can ask Google if a particular light is on. The Google Assistant will respond and react in real time, allowing homeowners to control lights anywhere in the house. In addition to Google Home, the Google Assistant is accessible on Pixel (a phone by Google, and the first with the Google Assistant built in), select Android phones and Android Wear. With this on-the-go control, you can calm your worries of leaving the lights on and ask, “Ok, Google, are my lights on?” And when returning home, telling the Google Assistant “Ok, Google, turn on the living room lights,” means you can have a bright home waiting for you when you arrive at night. And making your home look lived in even when you’re away on vacation is simple; just say the word, and the Google Assistant on Google Home will automatically adjust Lutron lights per your command. The Google Assistant will work with Lutron’s Caséta Wireless system (available today) via the Smart Bridge, and the RadioRA 2 and HomeWorks QS (available in June) via the Lutron Connect Bridge. Visit CasetaWireless.com/GoogleAssistant, Lutron.com/RadioRA2, and Lutron.com/HomeWorksQS for more information.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 83 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares164 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research.

Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Nope. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google will allow competitors in Russia to get into Android By Ida Torres - April 18, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter To settle a dispute with Russian competition authorities that has been running for two years already, Google has finally agreed to allow its competitors to get into the Android mobile operating system. This means that Android smartphones and tablets will not just be all about Google, as the company continues to face various lawsuits all over the world, with competitors claiming unfair advantage with their business practices. The Russian court actually declared back in 2015 that the tech giant is breaking the law with these practices. In an out-of-court deal with FAS, the competition watchdog in Russia, Google will no longer require Android device manufacturers to have the Google products, especially the Google search engine itself, to be pre-installed on the smartphones and tablets. The complaint was first brought by Yandex, a Russian tech company, who of course wanted a fair deal where any search engine can be pre-installed if an OEM so wishes. So with this deal, Google will no longer have exclusivity over apps on Android-based devices in Russia. Google will also have to develop a tool wherein users can choose which default search engine they will use on their Android devices. It may be something similar to that tool where you can choose which is the default browser when opening links in social networks and other apps. Through this tool, users will also be able to easily change their settings and preferences when it comes to apps related to Google, particularly the search functions. This may actually be a precedent on how Google will deal with the other cases and complaints lodged against them. The head of Yandex’s Russian operations, Alexander Shuglin, said he is hoping that similar cases in Europe and other countries will also go this way.

Google Maps Timeline finally comes to iOS Feature available on Android and desktop since 2015 hits iOS; Google's main iOS search app also gets a small update. Matt McGee on April 18, 2017 at 2:13 pm More Google Maps users on iOS are getting a feature that’s new to them, but not to users on Android or desktop computers. It’s called Timeline, and Google first rolled it out during the summer of 2015. Timeline is sort of like a life log tool — it tracks all the places you’ve visited over a specific period of time. It’s similar to what you can do via check-in platforms like Yelp and Swarm (and Facebook, even), but Timeline for Google Maps doesn’t require a check-in action. Users can revisit places they’ve visited via a new tab in the Google Maps menu, and Google will also add a note (e.g., “You visited 4 days ago”) to the place cards of locations they’ve visited — but that note will only be visible to the user, not to the public. Timeline also lets users edit and/or delete the locations they’ve visited. There’s also an option to subscribe to monthly emails in which Google will summarize all the places you’ve visited. Minor Google Search app update, too I should also mention that the Google iOS search app had a minor update this week. Version 25 of that app now lets users swipe left to delete past search terms from the list of suggested search terms that appear when searching.

It's a lesson Brian Warner knows well. He founded CelebrityNetWorth.com—a site that fairly authoritatively estimates the net worth of the glitterati and beyond—in 2008. It's knowledge we apparently want, because after a handful of years the site wasn't just supporting him, but a staff of 12. Then Google pulled the rug out. In explaining just what happened over the past five years, the Outline views it like so: Google, once content to be a "librarian," started experimenting with being an "oracle." Submit your question, and instead of getting links to choose from, you'll see a box atop those links—a "Featured Snippet"—that tries to answer it. Google in 2014 emailed Warner asking if his site would serve as an "authoritative source" on the subject, with Google culling his data and packaging it in those boxes. He said no. Google scraped the info anyway and used it to create Featured Snippets for Warner's 25,000-entry database. How he knew this to be true: He peppered in bogus listings for non-celeb friends and, yep, they turned up, he says. With Googlers no longer needing to go to his site to get the figure they were seeking, month-over-month traffic cratered as much as 65%; he had to ax half his staff. That was the injury. The insult was that in some cases the Featured Snippet's source was a site that just quoted CelebrityNetWorth.com. At the Outline, the full story explains why that's a problem using Larry David as an example.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   11% Hilarious 18% Intriguing 30% Depressing 2% Brilliant 17% Scary 21% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 14 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 14 comments tpvero 13 minutes ago Google turned evil and has us all by the short hairs.

Website "The Wrap" called Newser a parasite for stealing traffic. Newser's defense? They claimed to provide two links in their copy and paste plus a link on the sidebar called "source grid". On my browser, the source grid no longer exists and Newser often only provides one link in the story.

ABC News Emily Shapiro, ABC News , WFAA 2:18 PM. CDT April 18, 2017 Angelo Colon-Ortiz. (Photo: ABC) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST The man suspected of killing Google employee Vanessa Marcotte made his first appearance in court this morning, eight months after the 27-year-old disappeared while jogging near her mother's Princeton, Massachusetts, home. Angelo Colon-Ortiz, 31, of Worcester, who has been charged with aggravated assault, aggravated assault and battery, and assault with intent to rape, was held on $10 million cash bail, according to The Associated Press. An attorney for Colon-Ortiz entered not guilty pleas to the charges, the AP said. Prosecutors also expect to charge him with murder, the AP said. On Aug. 7, 2016, Marcotte, an account manager at Google in New York, went for a jog in Princeton, a town about 60 miles west of Boston, and never returned. Her body was found that night in a wooded area about half a mile from her mother’s home. Marcotte had planned to return home to New York that night, officials said. Colon-Ortiz was arrested on Friday in connection with Marcotte's killing after his DNA matched samples taken from Marcotte's hands. Police found Colon-Ortiz after a Massachusetts state trooper spotted a man matching the suspect in Marcotte killing's description driving a dark SUV in Worcester, the Worcester County District Attorney's Office said. The trooper didn't have paper, so he "wrote the license plate number down on his hand and followed up," the district attorney's office said. "He later went to the suspect’s home ... where suspect provided the DNA that led to the match." Marcotte's cousins, Caroline Tocci and Steve Vittorioso, told ABC News they weren't surprised that the 27-year-old helped catch her own alleged killer by getting his DNA. "Vanessa is a fighter," Vittorioso said. "I know that she was doing everything she can. She really tried to persevere. ... She is our role model." "We're very proud of her strength and what she did," Tocci said. "We know how strong of a person she is and every day we strive to be more like her."

During the Facebook Development Conference: F8 – which is taking place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose today and tomorrow – the social media company unveiled its "first social VR product". Facebook Spaces is a new application that enables users to access much of the site's service within a world of virtual reality. Get ready for virtual avatars, people. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The application is now available on the early-access section of the Oculus store front. "Hang out with your friends in a fun, interactive virtual environment as if you were in the same room, no matter where you are," says the product description. "Use your Facebook photos to create your virtual self, then invite your Facebook friends to join you. "You'll find a variety of Facebook content, including 360 videos and photos, that can transport you to new places. Draw 3D objects with virtual markers, video call your friends outside of VR, and share selfies of your VR memories on Facebook. "With Facebook Spaces, you can hang out in a whole new way – together." ©  Facebook The service allows users to invite up to three Facebook friends while using Facebook Spaces - and you can even interact with people in Facebook Messenger directly within Spaces. However, those friends have to own own Facebook's own VR Oculus Rift headsets as well. This news comes as Snapchat announces it's bringing augmented reality to your phone's front-facing camera via the new 'World Lenses' feature. The feature places a 3D object over the rear camera input, be that a Bitmoji or stylised text. Just like a real-world object, it can be manipulated in different dimensions and when users move around it, it stays in place. In summary, time to say goodbye to 'real' reality – the future's here, and it's made of pixels. Want up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?

The partnership lets PayPal users link their accounts to Android Pay, Google’s digital wallet, on smartphones running most versions of the Android operating system. This makes PayPal a funding option when people use Android Pay in locations including Walgreens and Dunkin’ Donuts. PayPal was added as a payment method for Google Play, its app and digital content store, almost three years ago. PayPal CEO Dan Schulman has been busy cutting deals with banks, credit card issuers and wireless carriers to convert PayPal from a payments button on websites into a versatile financial tool used to make payments in stores, transfer money overseas and shop from smartphones on the go. The Android Pay deal increases PayPal’s reach in stores, which Schulman sees as key to getting customers to use PayPal more frequently than the current average of two to three transactions per month. “This is the next logical step,” said Aunkur Arya, senior vice president at PayPal unit Braintree, which enabled the Android Pay partnership. TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Business news first: Sign in for newsletters One big challenge remains: PayPal accounts can’t link to Apple’s digital wallet, Apple Pay. The stronger relationship between Google and PayPal could rekindle speculation about an acquisition. PayPal split from parent company eBay two years ago, prompting hope it could be a target of tech companies or financial institutions looking to enter the digital payments industry. PayPal processed $354 billion in payments for 197 million active customers last year. “The more closely they work together, the more potential there is for a future combination,” said Gil Luria, director of research at D.A. Davidson & Co. PayPal declined to comment on takeover talk, while a Google spokeswoman wasn’t available to comment. Shoppers accustomed to swiping credit cards have been slow to embrace digital wallets, which use technology called near-field communication to enable transactions between smartphones and retail payment terminals. The PayPal deal may boost Google’s mobile payments efforts, which have progressed in fits and starts. The search giant’s Google Wallet failed to gain widespread acceptance, and its Android Pay faces competition from Apple. Two years ago, Samsung, the largest Android phone maker, introduced its own payment system, Samsung Pay, for its devices. Spencer Soper and Mark Bergen are Bloomberg writers.

The Google service has undergone a complete revamp which adds a new interface, 3D maps, and a fresh way of exploring the world, called 'Voyager'. This feature attaches multimedia content to sequences of pins around the map, informing users about select locations. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Tours vary in subject from architecture, to ancient history, to nature. The 'UNESCO World Heritage Sites' tour, for instance, takes users to 30 different places including the Pyramids of Giza and Stonehenge. The most prominent Attenborough-led content is the new 'Beautiful Birds-of-Paradise', which takes users across Papua New Guinea to glimpse some of the world's most colourful and bizarre feathered friends. Google has partnered with several organisations, including the BBC, to add insights and imagery to Earth. Tours feature content from Life Story, Africa and Planet Earth II. ©  Google The new Google Earth was over two years in the making, and provides a more detailed, immersive view of the world's locations than ever before. Voyager offers a surprising amount of content, which is made all the richer by the experience of zooming around a 3D map. Users can also use the "I'm feeling lucky" button, which sends them to random places in the world. Another new feature known as Knowledge Cards comes in useful here. These windows hover in the corner of the screen, giving information about the currently selected location. This is often sourced from a Wikipedia entry, which can be directly accessed from the card.

Most prominent among them is Your Timeline, a feature that has been available on the web and on Android since 2015, but is welcome nonetheless. Your Timeline keeps track of all the locations you've visited and allows you to easily view that travel history in one place. Your Timeline is available in a couple of different locations within the Google Maps app. The primary way to access it is from the main menu, where it's prominently listed near the top. The other place Your Timeline will appear is on the place cards of locations you've visited before. While viewing information about, for instance, a restaurant you visited on a prior vacation to London, you would see a label that tells you how long ago you last visited. Tapping that label will take you straight to Your Timeline and to the date of your visit, so you can easily view other exploits from your trip. There are a couple of nice touches with Your Timeline that deserve mention. One is that you have the option to fully customize the information that's logged in Your Timeline. Besides simply editing a location's name or other basic details, you can also assign an activity to that trip. Options include 'Boating,' 'Hiking,' 'Catching Pokémon,' and many more. A second feature is that you can opt-in to receive monthly emails summarizing all the places you visited that prior month, which is a nice way to revisit and reflect on time past, and perhaps a source of encouragement to visit new places and try new things more often. Although Your Timeline took almost two years to reach iOS, time has at least meant that it's arrived well-polished. The latest update to Google Maps also brought with it a new directions widget and an iMessage app. The directions widget provides directions for your current trip, allowing you to scroll through each step of the journey without needing to unlock your device. The new iMessage app serves only a single purpose: sending your static location to friends. Once you open the iMessage app, a still image of your current location is loaded up and available to send by message. It's a simple utility, but perhaps some will find it useful.

Travel the virtual world with the new version of Google Earth By Bill Roberson — April 18, 2017 11:54 AM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Spin the virtual globe If you haven’t taken a spin around Google Earth for a while, today would be a good time to revisit the now 12-year-old app. Really, it’s been 12 years, and in that time, other Google-Earth-like apps, including Google’s own Maps app, have left the mothership and become our go-to navigation guides, so Google has now relaunched Google Earth as a more exploration-focused app rather than a tool for getting from A to B. Chief among the changes is the new Voyager mode, which not only takes you to new and interesting places but adds a lot of context, including videos and other information sources. And of course, Google Earth is infused with remarkable 3D renderings of most of the planet’s locales. Hey, that place looks sort of familiar. Check out the new Google Earth here, and you’ll need to be using either the Chrome browser or an Android phone for now. AMD gets its (affordable) game on Want to get some high-def gaming action going but can’t afford a pricy high-end video cards? We feel your pain. Good news, though: AMD is backing up its affordable line of new CPUs with some new GPUs in the form of a the RX500 line of video cards. We dropped the new RX570 into our favorite gaming PC to see what it could do, and it can do quite a lot. With 4gb of RAM, a hotter clock speed and other improvements, the 570 easily outpaced the RX 480 from last year, yet still comes in under $200. Couple the new video cards with AMD’s new Series 5 or 7 Ryzen chips, and you’ve got the basic ingredients for a high-powered gaming rig for a lot less than you might expect. Check out our review here. Current troubles, future hopes Seems like every big tech company has a developer conference these days, and Facebook is no different. Facebook F8 is upon us, and high-profile CEO Mark Zuckerberg is kicking this off today. While we’re sure Zuckerberg and team would like to focus on the future of Facebook, recent events are at the fore, including a shocking murder broadcast live on Facebook and the ongoing issue of policing “fake news” on the social network. Other topics will likely include updates to the Oculus Rift VR system, and perhaps some changes for Instagram, both of which are owned and operated by Facebook. We’ll have full wrap-ups of F8 today and tomorrow right here.
Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News Santa Clarita, CA Reason #49 Why Sourcing Your Local Reputation-Management Needs and Custom Blog Content Creation to www.G3-Development.co Is Beautiful Santa Clarita, CA — (SBWIRE) — 04/18/2017 — Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine’s „natural” or un-paid („organic”) search results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine’s users. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines. As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic. Webmasters and content providers began optimizing sites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Initially, all webmasters needed to do was to submit the address of a page, or URL, to the various engines which would send a „spider” to „crawl” that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be indexed. The process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine’s own server, where a second program, known as an indexer, extracts various information about the page, such as the words it contains and where these are located, as well as any weight for specific words, and all links the page contains, which are then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date. By 2004, search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in their ranking algorithms to reduce the impact of link manipulation. In June 2007, The New York Times’ Saul Hansell stated Google ranks sites using more than 200 different signals. The leading search engines, Google, Bing, and Yahoo, do not disclose the algorithms they use to rank pages. Some SEO practitioners have studied different approaches to search engine optimization, and have shared their personal opinions.  Patents related to search engines can provide information to better understand search engines. In 2005, Google began personalizing search results for each user. Depending on their history of previous searches, Google crafted results for logged in users. In 2008, Bruce Clay said that „ranking is dead” because of personalized search. He opined that it would become meaningless to discuss how a website ranked, because its rank would potentially be different for each user and each search. In December 2009, Google announced it would be using the web search history of all its users in order to populate search results. Google Instant, real-time-search, was introduced in late 2010 in an attempt to make search results more timely and relevant. Historically site administrators have spent months or even years optimizing a website to increase search rankings. With the growth in popularity of social media sites and blogs the leading engines made changes to their algorithms to allow fresh content to rank quickly within the search results. In February 2011, Google announced the Panda update, which penalizes websites containing content duplicated from other websites and sources. Historically websites have copied content from one another and benefited in search engine rankings by engaging in this practice, however Google implemented a new system which punishes sites whose content is not unique.  In April 2012, Google launched the Google Penguin update the goal of which was to penalize websites that used manipulative techniques to improve their rankings on the search engine. Santa Clarita, CA Reason #49 Why Sourcing Your Local Reputation-Management Needs and Custom Blog Content Creation to http://www.G3-Development.co/ is Beautiful Common Mistake #1:  Hiring the Wrong Coach – There are a lot of people tagging themselves as „Social Media Experts, Gurus or Certified Specialists.”  Most of the people making these claims are individuals/organizations who offer „basic Social Media skill sets and copy methodologies” which, in the end, will get  the wrong kind of connections, a lot of the wrong followers as well as a bad reputation in the marketplace.  Just like in the Indiana Jones movie, one needs to „choose wisely” or they will perish from a Social Media perspective. Communications is a system to leverage an organizations ability to connect with ones market; Social Media is „the new” communications system.  Communications is about reach.  Communicating is about relational dynamics between people.  Social Media provides the means to effectively communicate with ones market.  However, communicating in human rather than institutional terms.  If one is not communicating (listening first, initiating second) then, how in the world does one expect to create relationships with people and businesses that may want the value that one offers?

Following news of Google Hire’s arrival, several publications claimed potential employers could use it to see applicants’ search histories – but this isn’t true. As noted by Gizmodo, sites including RT, the Daily Mail, the Sun, and an Australian news website all published articles claiming that by signing into the service using a Google account, job seekers are exposing their search histories and YouTube viewing habits to recruiters. "The site offers the option of using your personal account, prompting you to 'sign in with Google,'" writes the Sun. "[users will] have to make sure they don’t do any x-rated browsing while signed in." While this wouldn’t be the first instance of a company selling your personal data, the allegations in this case are false. When asked if a potential employer could see a Google Hire user’s search history, either by accident or on purpose, a spokesperson told Gizmodo: “Google does not share private information such as search or viewing history. Only the information that applicants input into Google Hire will be shared—for example, first name, last name, email address, resume, cover letter, etc.” Google Hire is in the early stages of development and it still isn’t possible to create an account from the homepage, suggesting it’s only open to select customers right now. If you do use the service once it rolls out to everyone, don't worry about your next boss discovering your love of hentai.

Published on April 18, 2017. Most Popular McDonald's is nowhere in its latest campaign, which banks on the social cred of Mindy Kaling, the power of Google, as well as its own reputation as the best place to consume something other than burgers and fries -- Coca-Cola. A new effort out of We Are Unlimited stars the comedian and actress (wearing a yellow dress and standing in front of a red backdrop) talking about the "place where Coke tastes soooo good," and then urging viewers to go ahead, Google it. Turns out, she's slyly directing viewers to the Golden Arches. It so happens there's a whole pop culture mythology around Coca-Cola tasting extra delicious at McDonald's, and the fast feeder is using it for its latest beverage promotion -- where Cokes (and any other soft drinks) will be $1, and small McCafe drinks are going for $2. The film lives on a YouTube channel, "That place where Coke tastes SO good," which also includes other funny ads that riff on the theme. On April 13, Mindy Kaling, a self-proclaimed (and quite righteous) McDonald's fan, tweeted, "I partnered with a brand w/o being able to say the name of the brand. Is that normal? If so, can I be paid in fries?" It accompanied one ad featuring Kaling and an unnamed beverage technician, both of whom get bleeped every time they presumably say the restaurant's name. Another ad depicts Kaling interviewing a mysterious worker at the unnamed restaurant trying to explain why the Coke tastes so good, but things take a hilariously absurd turn when the ad attempts to distort his voice. According to McDonald's, this is the company's first unbranded marketing campaign. The ad was created during the tenure of outgoing McDonald's U.S. Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Wahl. In early April, McDonald's announced Wahl would be replaced this month by PepsiCo's Morgan Flatley. Kaling's fans are aware of the star's affection for McDonald's. But it's not the only burger joint she's linked up with. In September 2015, Umami Burger announced a collaboration with Kaling called The Mindy Burger, as part of its Artist Series fundraising effort. The Mindy Burger, a beef patty topped with pickled jalapeño, fried onion strings and Sriracha Aioli on the chain's signature bun, was $13 with $1 from each sale donated to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.

Nat and Friends’ video, though, focuses less on the announcement and more on how Google captures images of landscapes and then uses them to create a 3D model of the world. Without giving the entire video away, Google basically flies an airplane back and forth over an area while taking thousands of photographs that are then used to create 3D models. The company also uses satellite imagery to capture images of the globe as a whole. You can watch the entire video below. Sadly, the name change to the 20% project YouTube channel does mean that one of its co-hosts, Lo, is leaving the project. She is still in this video, but going forward, Nat will mainly be interviewing other departments around Google on her own.

Its latest experiment is called Sketch-RNN, and it’s a neural network system that has learned to draw on its own by looking at roughly 5.5 million sketches from people who played Pictionary with Google’s AI-powered Quick, Draw! game from last year. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE By triaging sketches in 75 different categories like cats, pigs and trucks, the AI can now draw basic representations of these things when presented with hand-drawn sketches. It’s not merely copying what it’s fed; instead, it’s identifying what the input stands for and is trying to create a unique doodle based on what it knows about each object. For example, you could give Sketch-RNN a drawing of a cat’s face with three eyes, and it’ll spit out another version with two eyes – because it’s been trained to understand that cats only have a pair of eyes. Sketch-RNN can also draw without the help of a starting sketch, and can even complete sketches that a human has started, but not finished. Sketch-RNN can finish incomplete drawings started by humans (left column) Sure, the sketches aren’t exactly photorealistic, but the idea here is to ‘train a machine to draw and generalize abstract concepts in a manner similar to humans’, and Google has achieved that. The researchers behind the project believe that this tech could lead to interesting applications, such as using computers to teach people how to draw, and generating patterns with similar but unique shapes for textile designers.

Roston - Apr 18, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google has made its Cloud Speech API generally available to developers following its successful open beta last year. This Automatic Speech Recognition service is built upon the same foundation that powers Google Assistant and Google Now’s speech recognition abilities, and it aims to solve the speech-to-text needs of Google Cloud customers, the company says. Joining its general availability are a couple improvements and expanded support. If you’re unfamiliar with the Cloud Speech API, you can get personally acquainted via Google’s online demonstration, which turns your own speech into text. You can try it out for yourself here. The API, says Google, is one of many machine-learning models that is pre-trained and up for the task of, in this case, turning speech into written words. Google says that the early beta testers have largely demonstrated one of two primary ‘use cases’: speech analytics and speech-based control of devices and apps. The speech analytics part is highlighted as one big use for the technology, with Google saying it can enable call centers, as one example, to gather insights from conversations that are taking place in real time. As mentioned, Google Cloud Speech API has also been updated; it now has better transcription accuracy, says Google, when used with ‘long-form audio.’ The technology is also about three times faster when it comes to batch processing, and it also has improved file format support for things like Speex, WAV, and Opus.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue. I would only use this along with the other biometric security features if I could have all of them turned on and required to unlock the device. im wondering if the double press home to open the camera is still functional. im guessing not. EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Nope. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ?

Its answer to Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa and Google's, um, Google Assistant was to be called Bixby. And it would, according to Samsung Mobile CTO and Bixby architect Injong Rhee, be an "interface revolution." Well, the reviews are in and Bixby is more Shixby. Samsung has a lot to do with the release of its Galaxy S8: the company was making significant headway against Apple's iPhone with its Galaxy range. It offered phone hardware that was in many respects better than Apple's and included features that have still yet to appear in the iPhone. But then came the Galaxy Note 7 and its exploding batteries, which led to a massive recall. The S8 not only has to deal with the fact that people are waiting to compare it with Apple's new iPhone, expected this summer, but also get over the brand damage of the exploding batteries. Presumably, the company thought that crowing about Bixby and how it would also connect with other Samsung devices – everything from TVs to fridges via VR glasses – would give it that edge. About the voice thing... But then it confirmed just one week before launch that the Bixby voice assistant would not actually come with the "voice" part. Instead, customers will have to wait until "later this spring" – a vague timeframe that in the tech world means anything from the end of May to January next year. If the failure to actually include the most important element of Shixby in the phone wasn't bad enough, early reviewers are also unimpressed with what the digital assistant can do on the phone itself. "Bixby is an intelligent user interface," said CTO Rhee last month, stressing that it would focus on the phone's functions rather than trying to act like a digital encyclopedia. But that intelligence appears to comprise little more than flashing up information derived from apps – like things trending on Twitter, things in your calendar and breaking news. These things already exist in other (Apple and Google) phones. And there are countless apps that do the same, sometimes better. Samsung has dedicated an entire button on its phone to Bixby. The desperate drive for a digital assistant so the company doesn't get left behind has even led to Samsung going against one of the features that people most like its phones for: keeping unnecessary clutter to a minimum. In fact, some reviewers have reported that they are using Google's Assistant – which also comes on the S8 – in preference to Shixby, putting Samsung in the embarrassing Apple camp where people shove unwanted apps forced on them by Cupertino into an "Apple shit" folder. So what do we have? When it admitted voice wasn't coming at launch, Samsung tried to put a brave face on it by hyping up the stuff that Bixby would do: "Bixby will make your phone more helpful by assisting in completing tasks, telling you what you're looking at, learning your routine and remembering what you need to do," it said, flagging up Home, Reminder and Vision. Home is a little menu that pops up when you hit the dedicated Bixby button on the side. It does the same as every other smartphone on the market – aggregating recent alerts from your apps. To make it worse, the promise of customizing what pops up when you press the Bixby has been removed at the last minute, so you are stuck with whatever Samsung decides you need (how very Apple). Reminder is exactly that and no more: a reminder app. Leaving Vision. Which is pretty much the only thing that people like about Shixby. It helps you buy things (oh, thank god because we all have trouble finding things to buy). Basically it's RedLaser or Amazon Flow but built into the phone: press an icon while looking through the camera to scan a barcode. But this is not something that people are going to use all the time, especially when there are apps like Amazon's main app, which lets you do the same. Vision also does translation – point it at a sign and get a translated version – but apparently doesn't work as well as other existing apps. Samsung swears that this will all get much, much better soon. The inclusion of voice will make it work much better, and it will shortly start integrating with other products (think smarthome tech and saying "turn off the lounge lights" into your phone). And the company intends to open it up to third parties – which might, if done well, help it become the smartphone version of Amazon's Alexa. But that's all future possibilities. All we know for sure right now is that Samsung has significantly under-delivered. Shixby it is. ® Tips and corrections 9 Comments More from The Register Samsung Galaxy S8: Slimmer bezels, a desktop mode – and yet another me-too AI pal Pics And it doesn't explode ... hopefully 62 Comments Samsung Galaxy S8 will be a no-show at MWC, exec says MWC 2017 Preview of next flagship delayed as embers of Note 7 debacle still burn 9 Comments Siri, clone yourself and dive into this Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone Say hello to Bixby – Sammy's hopefully non-exploding AI assistant 49 Comments VMware, Citrix to have a crack at desktops on docked smartphones Samsung Galaxy S8 can do it natively.

Speak to Go is activated by a user’s voice. When a user says the name of a place, Google Street View imagery pops up on one’s phone or web browser. For example, Richard Byrne, who writes the blog Free Technology for Teachers, recently spoke the word “Maine,” and was taken to Acadia National Park in Maine. Had he been more specific and said “Portland, Maine,” he would have seen imagery of Portland, he said. Speak to Go is designed to be used with smartphones inside of VR headsets, such as the Google Cardboard. However, it can also be used in the Chrome web browser if the user allows access to his/her microphone. The imagery isn’t as immersive in the web version as in the VR version, but it is still decent, Byrne said. Even in other browsers and without a VR headset, users can explore random locations in the world by clicking on “Try it without a headset” and tapping the space bar or the phone screen. A location pops up, and a 360-degree view is provided. Users can navigate perspectives either by clicking and dragging on a web browser or moving around with a phone. Clicking on arrows allows further mobility and exploration. Random locations include Niagara Falls, the Taj Mahal and Mont Blanc massif (mountain range) in France. In education, Speak to Go is a quick and easy option for exploring VR imagery without the need to touch a screen or click a command. In the web version, Speak to Go makes Street View imagery slightly more accessible to the average user. To try for yourself, visit the Speak to Go website.

(AP Photo/Anick Jesdanun) (The Associated Press) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Tuesday, April 18, 2017, 1:48 PM NEW YORK (AP) — Google Earth is getting a revival, as the 3-D mapping service reorients itself to become more of a tool for adventure and exploration. A central feature in the new Google Earth is Voyager. Google has partnered with such groups as the BBC and NASA to add video clips, photos and text narratives to three-dimensional representations of particular locations. The Jane Goodall Institute, for instance, lets you journey to spots in Tanzania that inspired its founding chimpanzee expert. You can also get overlays of chimpanzee ranges and compare imagery from 2005 and 2014 to see the effects of forest restoration efforts. The producers of "Sesame Street" show off Muppets from co-productions around the world; the map shows where the Muppets live and offer stories about the region and its culture.

(AP Photo/Anick Jesdanun) (The Associated Press) Separately, a new "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature takes you to a location selected at random. Google Earth is highlighting some 20,000 lesser-known destinations — the kinds of places locals might frequent or know about, such as the Indonesian island of Bunaken , part of a national marine park. Google Earth used to be the place to go to for satellite views and 3-D images stitched together from aerial fly-bys. A software download was required, limiting its use. Google Maps has incorporated many of those features, making Google Earth even less necessary. Tuesday's update is about giving you a reason to use Google Earth again. Google says that while Maps is about getting you to a destination, Earth is about immersing you there, or "getting lost." Kara Koch, producer with Sesame Workshop, demonstrates features on Google Earth, displayed in background, Tuesday, April 18, 2017, in New York.

(AP Photo/Anick Jesdanun) (The Associated Press) With the update, Google Earth now works on Google's Chrome browsers for desktops. It still requires an app for phones and tablets because of the heavy graphics involved; Google is rolling out updates for Android, but there's no Google Earth app for iPhones or iPads yet. Some older features will still require a software download on desktops. That includes maps of Mars and the moon through a partnership with NASA. Google also announced an update to a virtual-reality version of Google Earth. It now works with Facebook's Oculus Rift, not just the HTC Vive. But it won't work with cheaper, phone-based VR systems, such as Google's Daydream and Samsung's Gear VR. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

If you’re in the second camp, try these 10 great Samsung Galaxy Note 4 launchers to replace Touchwiz. These launchers will work on other smart phones simplifying the user interface, transforming it into a more pure Android look, or they add features that make users more efficient. Samsung calls their user interface Touchwiz. When users press their home buttons and wake up the screen on their phones, they see Touchwiz. It’s the software that organizes the app icons, widgets, the dock at the bottom of the screen and a few other optimizations. Download what’s called a launcher from the Google Play Store to change the way the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 or other Android phones work and look. Launchers come in many forms, with simple themes that do little more than change the look OS. Others add extra features or tweak the user interface to change the home screen app icons. A few totally re-imagine the Home screen. Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Launchers Most of these launchers come with a wizard that starts up the first time you open the new launcher’s app. The wizard shows how to pick the launcher on the launcher selection screen. The app wizard will open Android’s default home screen selection menu. The wizard shows users that they should select ALWAYS, which sets it as the default launcher for the phone. To try a new launcher once without permanently changing the default launcher select JUST ONCE instead of ALWAYS. This tells the phone to show the launcher selection menu the next time the person presses the home button on the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. It keeps showing this menu until they either choose ALWAYS or change the default launcher in the phone’s Settings, which we’ll show users how to do at the end. Many of these launchers come with a help screen like this one from Buzz Launcher. It shows users how to select the launcher as the default. Here are our ten favorite Android launchers that will make the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 a pleasure to use for those who hate Samsung’s default launcher Touchwiz. 8 Launcher – Pretty Cool 8 Launcher makes an Android phone look like it’s running iOS 8. 8 Launcher (Free) turns the phone into an iPhone, or at least makes it look like one. The familiar iOS grid of icons and default iOS background shows up on the phone. Organize the phone’s apps into iOS-style folders. This will make all your friends think you’ve somehow put Apple’s iPhone operating system on your Note 4. It’s also a great choice for switchers who ditched iOS for Android. Action Launcher 3 Action Launcher 3 (Free – $5 or $10 in-app purchases) does a nice job of taking the phone’s wallpaper and changing the color of the user interface to match. There’s also a nice app drawer that shows up when the user swipes in from the left side of the screen. Action Launcher 3 brings material design and some unique gestures to Android and the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Some other innovative features need an in-app purchase of $5 or $10 to unlock. They include something called shutters, a different way to open folders. Swipe the screen up to show a shutter, which lets the user quickly create a widget from an app icon. Just swipe from the icon and it automatically creates the widget associated with the app. Action Launcher 3’s app drawer slides out from the left side of the screen. There are a slew of gestures for navigating the phone. We also get material design, a benefit for people who still don’t have Lollipop on their Note 4. Buzz Launcher To add some variety to your Samsung Galaxy Note 4 install Buzz Launcher. The launcher changes the user interface by adding themes. They claim to offer 800,000 plus free themes for use. Change them based on they day of the week, as seen in the video above. Buzz Launcher uses gestures like this to do things. Swipe down with two fingers to open the Buzz Launcher settings menu. Gestures open things like the app drawer or the launcher customization menu. The launcher puts the apps you use in folders and then you can change things to suit your tastes. The Buzz Launcher includes a lot of customization options in the settings menu. The launcher looks beautiful. The themes can customize things the way you like. It’s unlikely that someone can’t find a theme they’ll enjoy. The Buzz Launcher default home screen. A Homepack collects the user’s personalizations. They can share their Homepacks with others using Buzz Launcher. CM Launcher – Boost, Secure CM Launcher – Boost, Secure focuses more on features than user interface, with a memory cleaner and built-in virus protection. CM Launcher – Boost, Secure (Free) not only changes the phone’s user interface, but also quickly clears out the memory of the phone. This hopefully will speed things up, especially when the phone’s memory holds a bunch of recently launched apps. Add to that the small memory footprint that CM Launcher adds to the phone. This should keep the launcher itself from bogging down the phone’s speed. That’s the “boost” part of the name. The “secure” part comes from a built-in virus scanner. The CM Launcher – Boost, Secure settings screen. In addition to speeding up the phone and keeping it safe from viruses, CM Launcher learns what apps the user launches most often and shows their app icons on the screen. It also automatically organizes them into folders based on the app category from the Google Play Store. CM Launcher puts a handy toolbar in the notification screen and on the lock screen. A handy notification area and lock screen toolbar makes the app worth installing even if you don’t use the launcher. People who don’t like to do the work of organizing their apps, but want them organized, will like the last feature. Others may hate it because it might not organize them the way the they’d prefer. EverythingMe Launcher The EverythingMe Launcher lives up to its name by organizing things based on how the phone’s owner uses things. It looks at what you’re doing and suggests apps, organizes the apps to bring the most uses to the forefront and shows missed call’s contact information if you have it. EverythingMe organizes apps for the user so they don’t need to spend hours doing it. The row of apps above the dock shows apps most often used. The folders in the middle show apps collected by the launcher based on category. EverythingMe Quick Contacts shows the people the user communicates with most. EverythingMe offers a user interface that’s organized automatically for the user. For example, the Quick Contacts screen shows the contacts the user communicates with most. At the bottom of the screen there’s a dialer button so the user can call anyone. Tap and hold the home screen to customize the launcher. There are options for the look of folders, icons, wallpaper and the number of rows and columns. The launcher will also let users add more smart folders, which collects apps into folders based on their Play Store category. Google Now Launcher Google offers the Google Now Launcher so phones that don’t run a pure Android experience can get close to it. Add the Google Keyboard to make it even more Googley. Launcher 8 Launcher 8 will put a Windows Phone-style launcher on an Android phone. Plenty of people try Windows Phone and like the user interface but hate the app selection. With Launcher 8 (Free) those people can get the Windows Phone experience plus the Google Play Store app selection. The launcher places tiles on the home screen that represent Android apps. Some of them even give us the live tile experience of Windows Phone 8 with the icon showing things like photos or contact pictures in a slide show. The calendar tile shows appointments. Other Launcher 8 themes are available from the free theme store. Customization gets difficult, but once the user figures out how it works, it’s a nice customizable interface. The app drawer shows up when the user swipes in from the right side of the screen. Get to the settings window by swiping in from the left. Add things to the home screen like apps, shortcuts to things like files or contacts, and even Android widgets. There’s also a healthy theme collection to customize the look of Launcher 8. Access all apps installed by swiping in from the right edge of the screen. Nova Launcher (Best of the Group) Nova Launcher home screen. Nova Launcher (Free) wins the “Best of the Bunch” award in this group of ten launchers. It gives us the simplest user interface with plenty of attractive customizations available. Nova Launcher is the tinkering user’s dream. One can increase the number of apps on the screen from the phone’s default to up to 12×12, although that won’t make it very usable. Using a 7×6 grid seems to work well on the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. There are so many settings the user can change that it can get overwhelming. However, using it in defaults works well too. Tap and hold a widget on the Nova Launcher home screen and tap Resize to change the size of the widget. The user can not only change the icon/widget grid size, but the look of app folders, the dock and more. It also changes the way the user moves between screens and what the animation looks like as it switches. Once the user places a new app or widget, they can tap and hold it to re-size it. This works great for some widgets, like the Evernote 4×1 widget. Widen it and get 5 or 6 widget icons on it so that the user can use Evernote tools with a single tap. Quickly create a photo note, voice note or drawing note plus other Evernote kinds of notes. I love that you can change the number of icons on the home screen. The $4 Nova Launcher Prime adds more. Gestures launch some of the Nova Actions, things Nova can do with a swipe or a tap when the user puts an action on the home screen in the free version. The Prime version also will hide unused apps in the app drawer. TouchWiz Easy Launcher Many owners of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 don’t know that there are two versions of Touchwiz installed. Go into the Settings and find Application. Then tap on Default Applications and choose the Home screen setting. Pick Touchwiz Easy to use it. Yahoo Aviate Launcher Tap and hold on the home screen to customize widgets or the wallpaper. Yahoo Aviate Launcher (Free) does the arranging of apps and app folders for you, but also asks the user what apps they use the most. Then it offers some beautiful wallpapers. The launcher shows five screens. The main screen will offer the time, an app drawer icon, the dock and a beautiful wallpaper to name a few things. Swipe left one screen to see Yahoo weather and news or other Spaces the user adds. Swipe again to see spaces, which correlate to the way someone might use their phone. It has spaces for music, work and other things. Use this to add more to the previous screen. From the main home screen, instead of swiping to the left, swipe right to see the apps installed collected into groups for social apps, productivity, entertainment and more. To see every app, swipe right one more time. They’re all listed alphabetically with a search button to find an app quickly. Yahoo Aviate organizes apps into collections. Get to this screen by swiping from the right side of the screen once. Add your widgets the main center home screen. Tap and hold to see available widgets or to change the wallpaper. The launcher offers a large collection of professional photos or the user can pick their own images. Swipe from the right side of the screen twice to get to the app list. Users can add collections of apps or spaces from each of those screens. Swipe from the left edge twice to select the Space you want to use. Spaces are app groups based on use, like listening or work. People who don’t like to organize things will love Aviate. It wins honorable mention in this roundup only because Nova Launcher gives users more powerful control. People who don’t like to tinker will prefer Aviate. Here’s the listening space in Aviate Launcher. The user can tap and hold to add widgets for listening here. To add content to the screen, tap Add Collection to put another of the collections in the screen to the left. Add widgets as well by taping Add Widget. How to Go Back to Touchwiz Go back to Touchwiz if you don’t like any of these new launchers. Open Settings by swiping down from the top of the screen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Top on the Settings icon in the upper right corner and find the Applications section. In that section tap on Default Applications and find the launcher setting. Pick Touchwiz here. This sets Touchwiz as the default launcher. 8 Responses 05/10/2015 Mark Holmstrand Reply I agree that Nova Launcher is the best, but why is it hidden in the middle of the article? 05/11/2015 Henry Jenkins Reply I use twisted app manager to keep multiple launchers on my phone. Moody of the launchers here I have used. It seems I m never satisfied, but they do have their appeal. So far, Aviate a and or Nova r my favorites, but Zero launcher for speed. 05/12/2015 Chuck Angel Reply So, the title says, 5 and the article says 10…not too impressed right from the start. Add to that that there is only a single paragraph mention of Google Now Launcher and that the ADW launcher was completely ignored. I’m even less impressed. This looked to me like a an article that would have been thrown together in a couple of hours for a last minute high school junior’s report in VoTech. 05/29/2015 personne Reply Agree with Chuck Angel. I’ve been using ADW for years and it’s been great. 06/18/2015 jay armstrong Reply great article! I like nova but am going to recommend everything me for family. Also, Themer is another great, unique launcher that would be welcome in this list. 04/13/2016 Tim P Reply I love Nova launcher but would also have included Apex in this list. I know it’s very similar to Nova and I go back and forth sometimes between the two (I have Pro versions of both). But a couple of things I like about Apex is the ability to add App shortcuts directly to a screen by a long hold press while Nova does not give you that option. Also when you apply different Icon themes on Apex you can choose exactly what you want to bet applied between the icons, skin, font, and wallpaper of an Icon pack while Nova just applies everything by default. 04/18/2017 Russell M Duarte Reply What is the best free android launcher for samsung J7 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research.

Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year.

Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Nope. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ?

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Burger King triggers Google Home devices with TV ad 18 Apr 2017 3 Google Post navigation Previous: Tuesday review – the hot 22 stories of the week Next: Researchers develop synthetic skeleton keys for fingerprint sensors by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit After using an ad to hijack the OK Google voice assistant so it would read Whopper ingredients from Wikipedia, Burger King itself has been flame-broiled by scampy Wikipedia editors. Here’s the 15-second ad, released on Wednesday: In it, a cheeky young actor dressed like a fast food employee says this: You’re watching a 15-second Burger King ad, which is unfortunately not enough time to explain all the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich. But I got an idea. Then, he beckons the camera closer and says this home assistant triggering line: OK Google, what is the Whopper burger? As you can see in the 30-second video posted by the New York Times, it works just as Burger King planned. A home assistant device powered by OK Google lights up and reads out the ingredients list, which, as it turns out, was edited by a Wikipedian last week who goes by the username Fermachado123. That appears to be the username of Burger King’s marketing chief, Fernando Machado. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Before Fermachado123 injected his marketingese into it, the first line of the Whopper entry read like so: The Whopper sandwich is the signature hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack’s. After Fermachado123’s marketing fluff injection, that first line read like this: The Whopper is a burger, consisting of a flame-grilled patty made with 100 percent beef with no preservatives or fillers, topped with sliced tomatoes, onions, lettuce, pickles, ketchup, and mayonnaise, served on a sesame-seed bun. Oh, really? said other Wikipedians, who went on to edit the ingredient list to include, variously, an “often stinky combination of dead and live bacteria,” “mucus,” a “fatally poisonous substance that a person ingests deliberately to quickly commit suicide” and “a juicy 100 percent rat meat and toenail clipping hamburger product”. Google eventually stuck a stick in the spokes of the marketing wheels. Within hours of the ad’s release and the addition of these alternative/toxic/illegal ingredients, tests run by The Verge and BuzzFeed showed that Burger King’s commercial had stopped activating OK Google devices. Wikipedia also pulled the plug on the fun, locking the Whopper entry and allowing changes to be made only by authorized administrators. Veteran privacy activist Lauren Weinstein took to his blog to accuse Burger King of a “direct and voluntary violation of law”: …the federal CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) broadly prohibits anyone from accessing a computer without authorization. There’s no doubt that Google Home and its associated Google-based systems are computers, and I know that I didn’t give Burger King permission to access and use my Google Home or my associated Google account. Nor did millions of other users. And it’s obvious that Google didn’t give that permission either. This isn’t the first time that commercials have accidentally set off voice assistants. It happened with a Google Home ad, which aired during the Super Bowl in February, for one. “OK Google,” said people in the ad, causing devices across the land to light up. Alexa’s had its own share of miscues: in January, San Diego’s XETV-TDT aired a story about a 6-year-old girl who bought a $170 dollhouse and 4 lbs. of cookies by asking her family’s Alexa-enabled Amazon Echo, “Can you play dollhouse with me and get me a dollhouse?” Cute story, eh? Well, not for viewers throughout San Diego who complained that, after the news story aired, their Alexa devices tried to place orders for dollhouses in response. One problem with these internet of things (IoT) gadgets is that while they have voice recognition, they don’t necessarily have individual voice recognition. Any voice will do, be it from a neighbor talking to a device through an window and thereby letting himself into your locked house or a little kid who orders up a pricey Kidcraft Sparkle Mansion. For its part, Apple did, in fact, add individual voice recognition to the iOS 9 version of Siri… for good, money-saving, dollhouse-avoiding reasons.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue.

Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Nope. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ?

Did you know countries nearly went to war over such mix-ups? By Online Desk  |   Published: 19th April 2017 12:57 AM  |   Last Updated: 19th April 2017 11:49 AM  |   A+A A-   |   0 Share Via Email Chennai has gone missing from Google Maps. Google Maps has accidentally marked Chennai as Kovur. Kovur lies in the neighborhood of West Chennai which is around five Kilometers from Porur, a locality in the city. Yes, you heard it right. Chennai has gone missing from Google Maps. Google Maps has accidentally marked Chennai as Kovur. Kovur lies in the neighbourhood of West Chennai which is around five Kilometers from Porur, a locality in the city. Incidentally, a town in Andhra Pradesh's Nellore district is also called Kovur. While the others districts surrounding Chennai are marked correctly, it is astonishing to see that the capital city has been marked wrongly. If you thought this was the first major blunder by Google Maps, you'd be amazed at the numerous other instances -- even one where it nearly sparked a war. Here's a look: When Nicaragua invaded Costa Rica 2010 November might have been just another month for any one of us, but not definitely for the people of Costa Rica's Calero Island. Google Maps indicated that the border region belonged to Nicaragua. Troops led by former Sandinista guerrilla commander Eden Pastora consequently removed the Costa Rica flag and replaced it with theirs. The issue became so serious that the UN Security Council had to intervene only to determine that Google Maps had wrongly indicated that Calero Island was a part of Nicaragua. When Germany's Emden came under the Netherlands In the 15th century, Germany and the Dutch had issues over the border which even has a special place in history books discussing the European Border War. In 2011, Google Maps ensured that everyone revisited history, by displaying many of the places belonging to a harbour located in Germany's Emden as being a part of the neighbouring country Netherlands. When people searching for Sunrise, Florida were redirected to Sarasota, Florida, 200 miles away In 2010, people who had asked Google Maps for the direction to Florida's Sunrise were redirected to Sarasota, Florida. The two Florida cities were 200 miles apart. Later, Google fixed the technical glitch to put Sunrise back on the map. When tourists in the US searching for Round Valley State Park landed on a woman's doorstep Laurie Gneiding, who lives at a hill top in New Jersey's Hunterdon County in a 2011 interview to ABC News said that a technical glitch in Google Maps directed the tourists searching for Round Valley State Park land on her door step. As the number of visitors increased she even went on to put up plywood stating "NOT Park Entrance...Private Driveway... Google Maps is Wrong!" When commuters had to take a six-mile detour in Maryland When you are a commuter you won’t be pleased to take a detour after traveling for six miles. But that is exactly what happened to those who had taken the Intercounty Connector (Maryland's first all-electronic toll road). The toll road was set to open completely in 2012 spring. Prior to that in March, a six mile stretch was opened, but Google Maps accidentally displayed it as though the complete 18.8 miles were in use. Commuters who followed Google Maps ended up taking a long detour.

Did Google just surpass Monsanto as the world’s most EVIL corporation? Tuesday, April 18, 2017 by: Mike Adams Tags: Censorship, corporation, evil, evil corporations, Google, Monsanto, suppression, totalitarian (Natural News) For a very long time, Monsanto has been known as the world’s most evil corporation for promoting poison, monopolizing the seed supply and suing farmers after contaminating their fields with GMOs. But now, Google seems to have supplanted Monsanto, taking the prize as the world’s most evil corporation for its outrageous censorship, collusion with spy agencies and blatant attempts to propagandize the world with dishonest, deceitful information about everything from politics to natural medicine. Google, which was once founded on the slogan of “Do no evil” has in many ways become the very thing it once opposed. Beyond mere “evil,” Google seems to have recently become the most dangerous entity on the planet, threatening human freedom, human knowledge and the very future of human society as you’ll read below. What do you think about Google now? Sound off in the comments section below… Deliberate de-listing and censorship of independent media giants Mere weeks after de-listing the entire Natural News website due to a totally fabricated technical excuse, Google has now been caught red-handed instructing its contractors to rate content as “low” or “medium” quality for independent media website InfoWars, which exposes globalist agendas. InfoWars, which remained silent about Google’s censorship of Natural News, has now learned that remaining silent is a horrible idea because, well, “Then they came for me.” Now InfoWars is in the crosshairs of Google, which seems determined to manually alter its search results to deliberately silence all views Google doesn’t like. The dishonest search engine even chooses clickbait websites like BuzzFeed and Salon to “fact check” search engine results around “sensitive” topics such as Hillary Clinton, whom the delusional Left still insists never had a fainting spell and didn’t help sell U.S. uranium mining rights to Russian-owned mining companies. Lost in all this is the fact that the independent media is the only truly free press remaining in America, while the corporate-run “establishment” media is steeped in blatantly fake news and an all-out abandonment of anything resembling real journalism. If you want to see a real journalist doing real journalism, look no further than Luke Rudkowski of WeAreChange.org. All by himself, the guy has more courage and gumshoe journo-sense than the entire staff of the New York Times. In fact, it is the independent media that has led the way on every groundbreaking story that was once called a conspiracy theory, including Susan Rice’s surveillance of Trump team officials, the NSA spying on all your phone calls, Smart TVs spying on citizens and even the scientific evidence that vaccines cause autism in African-American infants. While the corporate-run media tries to cover up all these truths, the independent media is breaking the stories wide open on a daily basis, effectively taking over the job from the old school media and proving that citizen journalism is the future for truth on the internet. The rising new media, in other words, is making the old media look incredibly incompetent, which is why Google is now desperately trying to silence the new media and protect the old media monopolies from their impending collapse. As indy media giant All News Pipeline reported today: In conjunction with those types of attacks, we have also the mainstream establishment media attack Independent Media, from labeling them fake news” to calling them Russian propaganda, as well as actively “sitting” on stories that reflected badly on the previous administration, such as the Susan Rice “unmasking” bombshell, which was revealed by Independent Media personality, Mike Cernovich, who also reported that MSM outlets had the news, specifying Bloomberg and the NYT, but were refusing to report the truth to their audience. That was proven true when Bloomberg published their article over 14 hours later, confirming that Cernovich’s blockbuster, exclusive report was true. No wonder Google is trying so desperately to destroy and censor the independent media: WE’RE WINNING at every level! That’s because humanity wants to be free, and it is only through censorship, oppression and Google-style “Ministry of Truth” destruction of human knowledge that humanity can be kept enslaved. Over 70,000 people signed our Whitehouse petition to stop Google censorship, and that was during the time that Google 100% censored every Natural News web page, by the way, in a malicious effort to silence us. Google targets independent media for economic destruction, carries out “economic sabotage” against independent voices who question the status quo In a financial assault aimed at the independent media, Google is deceptively down-rating independent media web pages in a sneaky, covert effort to destroy web traffic to those sites. It’s also aggressively demonetizing independent media YouTube channels, ripping away as much as 90% of the revenue earned by indy media content producers. This is, of course, a form of economic sabotage against the independent media, deliberately waged by Google against the most important new voices of our generation. Google’s attempts to silence indy media voices is just as damning and destructive as historical efforts to silence people like Martin Luther King, Jr. who fought for human freedom and awakening (and was killed for doing so, of course). Would Google have stood up for MLK Jr., vs. the establishment status quo? Not a chance. Just as damning is Google’s all-in protectionist schemes to protect the profits of Big Pharma by tweaking search algorithms to favor pro-drug results while suppressing natural remedies and holistic medicine (which represent the only real solution to our current health care crisis, by the way). Did you know that Google Adwords blocked the Health Ranger Store from remarketing advertising because we sell superfoods and herbal remedies? We were told that because we offer medicinal mushrooms, we are selling what they claim is “medicine” (that obviously might threaten the profits of Big Pharma). Not that we want to hand money over to Google anyway, but it sure is informative to know that we’ve been banned for the simple reason that we offer safe, affordable, scientifically validated natural remedies that help save lives. Apparently, saving lives with natural medicine is despised by Google. On every topic imaginable, Google is opposed to freedom, humanity, health and happiness… it allies itself with the most destructive forces on our planet to suppress and enslave humankind On every topic you can think of — natural medicine, independent media, GMOs, economic freedom, medical choice, pesticides, the abortion industry, infectious disease, etc. — Google has now aligned itself with the most evil, destructive and criminal forces across our world. It’s now apparent to an ever-increasing number of people that Google has become the “enabler” of mass human death, destruction and suffering while censoring freedom, truth and awakening. What do you think about all this? Do you agree that Google is steeped in evil? Sound off in the comments below and let your voice be heard (while you still have a voice, anyway…). Beyond promoting discredited mainstream news sources (CNN, NYT, etc.) that seek the absolute destruction of liberty, health and objective truth, Google has also gone all-in for spying on its own users, suppressing human knowledge and enriching the most evil corporations on the planet (such as Monsanto, Merck, Syngenta, Nestle, etc.) Starting with banning independent media from Google News to now openly encouraging penalties against indy media news sites, Google seems determined to enslave humanity in a delusional bubble of false information from “official” sources that only know how to LIE. Those sources, of course, all tend to be Leftist, liberal sources that have now repeatedly shown they are completely intolerant of all opposing views, labeling them “hate speech” even if they are reasoned, rational analysis or opinions. In effect, Google has become an extension of the intolerance of its employees and executives, and it is wielding its search engine results as a weapon against human knowledge to usher in a new era of left-leaning totalitarianism that pretends to be “truth.” If you add it all up, it sure looks like Google wants to enslave humanity, destroy independent thought, silence the voices of reason and dominate humanity’s future. And it is very close to achieving all those sinister goals right now. If you use Google or own Google stock shares, you might be supporting EVIL without even knowing it The upshot of all this is that if you use Google in any way — Google search, Google analytics, Google adwords, etc. — you are supporting what might just be the most evil corporate entity on the planet. It’s also true if you own Google shares, by the way, because just owning such shares provides financial capital to the corporate entity that originally sold those shares. If you’re not an evil person, you need to think twice about using Google or owning Google shares. Upon closer inspection, you may find that Google’s actions violate your own human ethics and contradict the very things you believe are important for keeping humanity informed, aware and as free as possible. You already know that human freedom is not possible unless humans are free to think for themselves, right? And they aren’t free to think if they’re not free to access dissenting views that question the status quo. It is precisely those dissenting views that Google is now aggressively silencing. As a result, each of us who cares about the future of freedom and real progress for the human race must make a concerted effort to boycott all Google services and products to the greatest extent possible. Sadly, Google has attained a monopoly position of dominance over search, although smaller, independent search services do exist such as GoodGopher.com, which I created to index the independent media. DuckDuckGo.com is another Google search alternative that currently seems to provide excellent results, and it doesn’t spy on you like Google does. To see indy media news headlines throughout the day from censored websites, visit and bookmark Censored.news. It may be time to organize a mass protest of Google and its employees As Mike Cernovich said yesterday in an interview on InfoWars, he believes it’s time to organize a mass PEACEFUL protest of Google and its employees. The independent media may indeed be reaching a point where its very survival depends on organizing an effort to physically occupy Google campus sites, protest Google’s outrageous censorship policies and demand an end to Google’s totalitarian oppression of human knowledge. Perhaps it’s time that Google employees were told to their faces that they are working for the world’s most EVIL entity which is suppressing and enslaving humanity. The day is probably not far off when Google employees will be publicly shamed and condemned for taking part in the systematic pattern of economic sabotage, censorship and deliberate monopoly protectionism of poison-pushing corporate entities that Google protects. “The Left is morally and fiscally bankrupt, devoid of coherent solutions, and corrupted by its embrace of the Corporatocracy,” writes Charles Hugh Smith in a must-read blog article entitled The Left’s Descent to Fascism. His definition of fascism includes this gem that applies perfectly to Google: This status quo (i.e. The Establishment) seeks to impose a conformity of values and opinion that support the dominant narratives of the status quo via the mass (corporate) media and the state-controlled educational system… Dissent is by definition fake news or hate speech — Orwell would be so proud of the Left’s deft doublespeak. You can’t be pro-Google and anti-corporation at the same time, by the way. If you oppose corporate monopolies and the 1% running the world, then you must by definition strongly oppose Google for the simple reason that Google protects the 1% and silences the 99%. I think the day is coming when people who work for Google will be condemned for being part of a dangerous, ominous algorithm that seeks the total enslavement of humanity. Today, people who work for Monsanto don’t run around bragging about their employer, because they know Monsanto has a well-earned reputation for being a deeply evil corporate entity. That same situation is probably coming soon for Google employees who may one day soon look in the mirror and see themselves with a great sense of shame for taking part in the evil domination pursued by Google. Google is building an army of A.I. military robots… what will it do with all that power? If we don’t stop Google, it’s only a matter of time before Google’s robot division attains sufficient physical capabilities and A.I. prowess to be unleashed as Terminator-style Hunter-Killer robots to target human beings on the battlefield (or perhaps to even target political enemies). It’s not as far off as you might suppose. Before you know it, Google will be building massive armies of corporate-run robot soldiers, and Google will become a military might unto itself. What will Google do with all that power? As Google itself has already demonstrated, it will wield power to silence its enemies, suppress the truth, enslave humanity and dominate everything in sight. It’s not difficult to see how, given another 25 years of such evil run amok, Google could overthrow entire nations and supplant the governments we know today with its own totalitarian corporate dictatorship. To envision how Google might operate in a future where it controls the most dangerous humanoid robots armed with weapons, just ask yourself how Google operates today. Does Google respect humanity or does it try to enslave it? Does Google tolerate competition and criticism, or does it try to silence those who speak out against it? Does Google protect the privacy of its users, or does it sell you out with back door access to the NSA that violates your Fourth Amendment privacy every second of every day? The answer is abundantly clear: Google has become the world’s most evil — and dangerous — corporation. It has become a danger to human freedom, human knowledge and even human life. If we don’t stop Google’s march toward totalitarian dominance, the future of our world will look like a destitute dystopian society of enslaved humans, all kept ignorant and uninformed about reality (thanks to Google’s suppression of truth). No criticism of the “accepted, fact-checked reality” will be allowed on YouTube, Google or much of the internet, as any person who dares contradict the Leftist totalitarian narratives will be immediately stripped of ad revenues, search engine visibility and public credibility. Google — which should probably be renamed “OBEY” — will have achieved its ultimate goal of silencing all dissent, controlling all knowledge and overthrowing any governments that oppose it. In this future, Google will run all elections, and all winners of such elections will be little more than Google’s puppets, rubber stamping their legislative schemes that continue to grant more power to everything Google. Freedom will die. Dissent will become extinct. Reason will be labeled “hate speech.” Conformity will be mandatory. And one day, half the human population will be declared “obsolete” and no longer needed by the globalists because Google’s advanced robots will replace human labor. At that point, the depopulation ovens will run 24/7, all powered by Google’s A.I. algorithms, of course, which will calculate the most efficient expenditure of energy to terminate a human life. This is the future for humanity if Google is not stopped. Share your views on all this in the comment section below.

Follow his videos, podcasts, websites and science projects at the links below. Mike Adams serves as the founding editor of NaturalNews.com and the lab science director of an internationally accredited (ISO 17025) analytical laboratory known as CWC Labs. There, he was awarded a Certificate of Excellence for achieving extremely high accuracy in the analysis of toxic elements in unknown water samples using ICP-MS instrumentation. Adams is also highly proficient in running liquid chromatography, ion chromatography and mass spectrometry time-of-flight analytical instrumentation. He has also achieved numerous laboratory breakthroughs in the programming of automated liquid handling robots for sample preparation and external standards prep. The U.S. patent office has awarded Mike Adams patent NO. US 9526751 B2 for the invention of “Cesium Eliminator,” a lifesaving invention that removes up to 95% of radioactive cesium from the human digestive tract. Adams has pledged to donate full patent licensing rights to any state or national government that needs to manufacture the product to save human lives in the aftermath of a nuclear accident, disaster, act of war or act of terrorism. He has also stockpiled 10,000 kg of raw material to manufacture Cesium Eliminator in a Texas warehouse, and plans to donate the finished product to help save lives in Texas when the next nuclear event occurs. No independent scientist in the world has done more research on the removal of radioactive elements from the human digestive tract. Adams is a person of color whose ancestors include Africans and American Indians. He is of Native American heritage, which he credits as inspiring his “Health Ranger” passion for protecting life and nature against the destruction caused by chemicals, heavy metals and other forms of pollution. Adams is the founder and publisher of the open source science journal Natural Science Journal, the author of numerous peer-reviewed science papers published by the journal, and the author of the world’s first book that published ICP-MS heavy metals analysis results for foods, dietary supplements, pet food, spices and fast food. The book is entitled Food Forensics and is published by BenBella Books. In his laboratory research, Adams has made numerous food safety breakthroughs such as revealing rice protein products imported from Asia to be contaminated with toxic heavy metals like lead, cadmium and tungsten. Adams was the first food science researcher to document high levels of tungsten in superfoods. He also discovered over 11 ppm lead in imported mangosteen powder, and led an industry-wide voluntary agreement to limit heavy metals in rice protein products. In addition to his lab work, Adams is also the (non-paid) executive director of the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center (CWC), an organization that redirects 100% of its donations receipts to grant programs that teach children and women how to grow their own food or vastly improve their nutrition. Through the non-profit CWC, Adams also launched Nutrition Rescue, a program that donates essential vitamins to people in need. Click here to see some of the CWC success stories. With a background in science and software technology, Adams is the original founder of the email newsletter technology company known as Arial Software. Using his technical experience combined with his love for natural health, Adams developed and deployed the content management system currently driving NaturalNews.com. He also engineered the high-level statistical algorithms that power SCIENCE.naturalnews.com, a massive research resource featuring over 10 million scientific studies. Adams is well known for his incredibly popular consumer activism video blowing the lid on fake blueberries used throughout the food supply. He has also exposed “strange fibers” found in Chicken McNuggets, fake academic credentials of so-called health “gurus,” dangerous “detox” products imported as battery acid and sold for oral consumption, fake acai berry scams, the California raw milk raids, the vaccine research fraud revealed by industry whistleblowers and many other topics. Adams has also helped defend the rights of home gardeners and protect the medical freedom rights of parents. Adams is widely recognized to have made a remarkable global impact on issues like GMOs, vaccines, nutrition therapies, human consciousness. In addition to his activism, Adams is an accomplished musician who has released over fifteen popular songs covering a variety of activism topics.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Philip Bump By Philip Bump April 18 at 3:02 PM Follow @pbump If you pick up your iPhone and ask Apple’s personal assistant software the age of Mets third baseman David Wright, you get a direct answer: Wright, born in 1982, is 34 years old. You also get some ancillary information: A photo, his height, a nickname that no one uses. Apple’s Siri. Ask Google’s artificially intelligent question-answering system, same deal. David Wright is 34. Google’s Assistant. But until Monday evening if you were to ask the same question of Alexa, the Amazon system that powers the company’s Echo devices, you got a much different response. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) David Wright, according to Alexa/Echo, is 234 years old — by far the oldest person on the Mets roster or in professional baseball or in the recorded history of the human race. Wright may be injured a lot, but that’s only because he’s older than the Constitution of the United States. The Alexa app suggests that maybe you’d like to learn more about Wright at Microsoft’s search engine Bing. If you do so, you learn that Wright is … 34 years old. Microsoft’s Bing. I first noticed this bug back when David Wright was only 233. At my sister’s house, we were for some reason suddenly curious about how old the Mets all-star was, so we asked her Echo, which stands in the corner of her living room. “Alexa,” we said, triggering the device to listen, “how old is David Wright?” When we learned he was over two centuries old, we were obviously intrigued. Over time, we’d ask the same question repeatedly, to see if the error was fixed. Repeatedly, it was not. It is now, because, at long last, I reached out to Amazon to try to figure out where the problem was. Over email and on the phone, the company’s Art Pettigrue explained how Alexa works — and why, in this case, it didn’t. So let’s walk through what happened, step by step. When you make a request of an Echo device (I have the hockey-puck-sized Dot), you get it to listen by prefacing your request with a “wake word,” usually “Alexa.” (Recently, the company expanded the list of wake words it accepts to include “Echo” and “Computer.”) It’s always listening to what you say, but it doesn’t do anything until you say the wake word — which is why it’s called a “wake” word. At that point, the device begins recording what you are saying, isolating the request you’ve made. The Echo doesn’t do anything with that question itself. It simply ships the question off to Amazon over the Internet in the form of an audio recording. Once it’s at Amazon, the processing begins. First, Pettigrue explained, Alexa figures out what you’re trying to ask. This is harder than it may sound, requiring the system to pick out a consistent phrase from background noise of conflicting speech patterns. If you’re listening to music as you ask your question, for example, Alexa needs to understand that you’re asking “how old is David Wright” not “how old I shot the is David Wright sheriff but I.” Amazon calls this “automatic speech recognition.” Then once Alexa has your question, it figures out what exactly you’re asking. In this case, the system needs to understand that I’m looking for the age of someone named David Wright. The Amazon term here is “natural language understanding.” “A human being is very good at disambiguating multiple responses,” Pettigrue explained, “but with a voice interface you want to try to make the one, right choice from the very beginning for them.” So now Alexa knows what we’re looking for. At this point, the system dips into “a variety of trusted sources” (per Pettigrue) to figure out an answer, if possible. In this case, it’s clear that Alexa knew which David Wright I was referring to, given that the response was exactly 200 years off. (Pettigrue said that he’d tried to track down other possible David Wrights with whom Alexa might be confusing the Met — without luck.) It’s just that, in the database, Wright’s year of birth was incorrect, apparently identifying him as having been born in 1782, at the tail end of the Revolutionary War. Pettigrue said that this was a function of data being input incorrectly by a human user, but was “not able to share the exact source of the error.” (It has, as noted above, already been corrected.) Once Amazon has its answer — correct or not — it uses a text-to-speech tool called Alexa Voice Service to convert the answer into an audio file that gets passed back to your Echo. When it receives that audio file, your Echo plays it, informing you that David Wright is 234 years old, which he isn’t. There is a saying in the computing world: Garbage in, garbage out. Computers — even sophisticated artificial intelligence systems — are simply connections and calculators that manipulate raw data that they are given. Amazon’s Alexa does a very good job of figuring out what you’re asking it, analyzing English language speech patterns to pick out what particular (admittedly simple) question you’re hoping it will answer. But if it’s pulling information from a database that has a garbage birth date for the person you’re wondering about, it will spit out a garbage answer. The good news for Mets fans is that David Wright is not 234 years old. The bad news is that, once again, he’s on the disabled list.

Google artificial intelligence will be put to work for Earth users in the form of “knowledge cards” that let them dive deeper into online information about mountains, countries, landmarks or other places being virtually visited. It will also make suggestions on other locations armchair explorers might be interested in exploring based on what they have searched in the past. “This is the first time we have done this deep integration with the Google Knowledge Graph,” Earth engineering manager Sean Askay said. “Everything Google knows about the world, you can know about the world.” There is also a newly installed “Feeling Lucky?” feature for people who want to let the software suggest hidden gems such as Pemba Island off the Swahili coast or the Oodaira Hot Spring in Yamagata, Japan. People can choose to fly around the world in Earth, using a 3-D button to see the Grand Canyon, Chateau Loire Valley and other stunning spots from any angles they wish. “With the new Earth, we want to open up different lenses for you to see the world and learn a bit about how it all fits together; to open your mind with new stories while giving you a new perspective on the locations and experiences you cherish,” Earth product manager Gopal Shah said in a blog post. Online explorers cruising the mobile version of Earth can also capture pictures on their travels, sending friends digital postcards. New Earth was launched on Google’s Chrome and Android software, with versions tailored for Apple devices and other internet browsing software promised soon. It’s the first time that Earth can be reached on a web browser instead of through applications installed on devices. The move allows Google to tap into more powerful computing power at data centers in the internet “cloud” instead of relying on the capabilities of smartphones and other devices. Asharq Al-Awsat English Asharq Al-Awsat is the world’s premier pan-Arab daily newspaper, printed simultaneously each day on four continents in 14 cities. Launched in London in 1978, Asharq Al-Awsat has established itself as the decisive publication on pan-Arab and international affairs, offering its readers in-depth analysis and exclusive editorials, as well as the most comprehensive coverage of the entire Arab world.

By Michael Simon Staff Writer, Greenbot | Apr 18, 2017 11:28 AM PT Credit: Google More like this Android Pay FAQ: Everything you need to know about Google's mobile payment... Google Play now accepts PayPal for digital goods Google is killing its bold Hands Free payment experiment Video Samsung Galaxy S8+ Unboxing We’re used to hearing about new banks that have signed on to support Android Pay as Google ever-expands its mobile purchasing system. But an announcement this morning is looking to add even more value. Now you’ll be able to use Android Pay even if you don’t have a bank or credit card to add to your wallet. Google has announced a partnership with PayPal that allows you to use your account to buy things anywhere Android Pay is accepted. While PayPal users have long been able to access their accounts in the real world via PayPal Credit, the new Android Pay integration will open up mobile contactless payments to a wide array of people, allowing them to use the balances to pay for things at McDonalds or Wal-Mart. The partnership is a boon for Android Pay, which is competing against Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and other store-based services for dominance. As Google describes, “Millions of people already use their PayPal account to make online purchases, receive payments and send money to friends and family. Soon they can start using the same PayPal account to tap and pay with their phones in stores and speed through checkout in Android apps.” PayPal says that it processed over $100 billion in mobile payment volume last year and hopes the Android Pay partnership will expand its reach. The new service, which is coming soon, will be limited to PayPal balances at launch, and will expand to include credit cards stored in your account over the coming months. Why this matters: Contactless payments are clearly the future of checkouts, and Android Pay is right at the forefront of the movement. With the new PayPal integration, along with the new Android Wear 2.0 support, Android Pay is poised to continue leading the charge.

Google is testing a new, more compact weather card Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 9:14am PDTApr 18, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 70 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares150 Google News The Google app feed (formerly known as Google Now) includes relevant bits of data from around the web and culled from your own data. One card we almost all have is weather, and Google looks to be experimenting with a new version of that one. Rather than the large card with the forecast, the new one is a single line with a few bits of relevant information. The new card shows the current conditions and forecast for the current day. The old card is much larger and includes the 5-day extended forecast. You can, of course, tap on the new card and get all that same information and more in the full weather screen. You can see the new card above and another comparison below. Left: New card, Right: Old card We've had a few reports of the new card rolling out, but it's still the larger one on all my devices. It's not clear if Google intends to make this the new default for everyone soon, or if it's still fooling around with it.

Nilotpal Bhattacharya Yeah...it's my screen :D Drunk Squirrel Yeah, much better like this. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/936caa6668167cddbf1f1e1c372b488765b9d624ac08ca457bc5106bd6c97dbd.png Wynnded I like the larger card myself. I can see the current weather on the home screen of my Pixel. The larger card is nice for glancing ahead to see if more detailed information is warranted. I'm not sure which might be more efficient though. Probably six of one, a half dozen of another. Willie Chalmers III I got this a couple of weeks ago, but it went away very quickly. I do prefer the larger one though. Did anyone else get an update to the traffic card that made it smaller? George I don't know... it seems like Google is testing all their products on us nowadays.. Can AP name one finished Google product? 7-down "Can AP name one finished Google product?" I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that. Nick Don't you know? Nothing is ever finished. In all seriousness I rather have Google A/B testing us than have stagnation in design and functionality. George true about the A/B testing... I mean, tech journalists gotta eat too, amiright? Timbets I got that bottom bar look (and small weather) with pixel launcher. With Google now launcher I have the old look with no bottom bar and large weather waloody88 The old one is better Bruce Wayne I like the old one better.

OK, maybe Bixby has a chance. navjot This is pretty cool. Hopefully they expand it to other cards, there are some in there that take up much more space than they need to. I also hope they eventually use dark icons in the notification bar when in the Google feed, the shadow looks kinda dated, especially in screenshots. Bru [971] NOOO! I WANT THE FROG!! Gregor Smith The Weather Frog has replaced the Tea House Fox as my Google Spirit Animal Rick Kode Thx for featuring me, I also like the old one more btw Jason Bell Yeah, well, I just got this cool new interface.

I like it as well.

Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezellless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen to body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8, or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold onto it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that have specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts on thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this Spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue.

Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Nope. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ?

"This is our gift to the world," Google Earth director Rebecca Moore said of the program that lets people range the planet from the comfort of their computers, smartphones or tablets. "It's a product that speaks to our deepest values around education and making information available to people." A new 'Voyager' feature enables people digitally exploring the planet to be guided on interactive stories told by experts, boasting partners including BBC Earth, NASA, Sesame Street, and the Jane Goodall Institute. Google artificial intelligence will be put to work for Earth users in the form of "knowledge cards" that let them dive deeper into online information about mountains, countries, landmarks or other places being virtually visited. It will also make suggestions on other locations armchair explorers might be interested in exploring based on what they have searched in the past. "This is the first time we have done this deep integration with the Google Knowledge Graph," Earth engineering manager Sean Askay said. "Everything Google knows about the world, you can know about the world." There is also a newly installed "Feeling Lucky?" feature for people who want to let the software suggest hidden gems such as Pemba Island off the Swahili coast or the Oodaira Hot Spring in Yamagata, Japan. People can choose to fly around the world in Earth, using a 3-D button to see the Grand Canyon, Chateau Loire Valley and other stunning spots from any angles they wish. "With the new Earth, we want to open up different lenses for you to see the world and learn a bit about how it all fits together; to open your mind with new stories while giving you a new perspective on the locations and experiences you cherish," Earth product manager Gopal Shah said in a blog post. Online explorers cruising the mobile version of Earth can also capture pictures on their travels, sending friends digital postcards. New Earth was launched on Google's Chrome and Android software, with versions tailored for Apple devices and other internet browsing software promised soon. It's the first time that Earth can be reached on a web browser instead of through applications installed on devices.  The move allows Google to tap into more powerful computing power at data centres in the internet "cloud" instead of relying on the capabilities of smartphones and other devices.

Google on Tuesday launched a re-imagined version of its free Earth mapping service, weaving in storytelling and artificial intelligence and freeing it from apps. (Photo: TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP/Getty Images) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE New York — Google Earth is getting a revival, as the 3-D mapping service reorients itself to become more of a tool for adventure and exploration. A central feature in the new Google Earth is Voyager. Google has partnered with such groups as the BBC and NASA to add video clips, photos and text narratives to three-dimensional representations of particular locations. The Jane Goodall Institute, for instance, lets you journey to spots in Tanzania that inspired its founding chimpanzee expert. You can also get overlays of chimpanzee ranges and compare imagery from 2005 and 2014 to see the effects of forest restoration efforts. The producers of “Sesame Street” show off Muppets from co-productions around the world; the map shows where the Muppets live and offer stories about the region and its culture. Separately, a new “I’m Feeling Lucky” feature takes you to a location selected at random. Google Earth is highlighting some 20,000 lesser-known destinations — the kinds of places locals might frequent or know about, such as the Indonesian island of Bunaken, part of a national marine park. Google Earth used to be the place to go to for satellite views and 3-D images stitched together from aerial fly-bys. A software download was required, limiting its use. Google Maps has incorporated many of those features, making Google Earth even less necessary. Tuesday’s update is about giving you a reason to use Google Earth again. Google says that while Maps is about getting you to a destination, Earth is about immersing you there, or “getting lost.” With the update, Google Earth now works on Google’s Chrome browsers for desktops. It still requires an app for phones and tablets because of the heavy graphics involved; Google is rolling out updates for Android, but there’s no Google Earth app for iPhones or iPads yet. Some older features will still require a software download on desktops. That includes maps of Mars and the moon through a partnership with NASA. Google also announced an update to a virtual-reality version of Google Earth. It now works with Facebook’s Oculus Rift, not just the HTC Vive. But it won’t work with cheaper, phone-based VR systems, such as Google’s Daydream and Samsung’s Gear VR. CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It’s used by tens of millions of people across the globe. The company continues to expand its partnerships in order to make it easier for people to use PayPal. It has now confirmed that it’s extending its partnership with Google which will enable users to opt for PayPal as a payment method in Google’s mobile payments service Android Pay. PayPal and Google forged their partnership around three years ago when PayPal was added as a payment method in Google Play. PayPal users will be able to use the service as a payment method in Android Pay anywhere they can use Google’s payment service in-store, in-app, and online. Customers in the United States will be able to use PayPal in Android Pay at retailers like Walgreens and Dunkin’ Donuts. Initially, users will be able to pay using their PayPal balance. In the coming months, they will also be allowed to pay with cards that have been stored with PayPal. This feature will be enabled by PayPal’s recent tokenization partnerships with major card networks. PayPal support for Android Pay is going to be supported on devices powered by Android version 4.4 or higher, this includes KitKat, Marshmallow, and Nougat. Filed in Cellphones.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     PayPal Partners With Google For Android Pay Posted: Apr 18 2017, 11:57am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Technology News   Google PayPal and Google Join Hands for Digital Wallet Partnership   It looks like both PayPal and Google are shaking hands in joint inclusivity over a novel digital wallet bonding. PayPal and Google are extending their joint partnership with a brand new agreement. This allows both of the giant firms to make provision  for payments through the utility of a phone from many retail hubs. PayPal users can now connect their accounts to Android Pay. Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock This happens to be Google’s main digital wallet system. PayPal is thus onto a payment choice at such locations as Walgreens Boots Alliance pharmaceutical stores and Dunkin’ Donuts eateries. PayPal and Google hooked up with each other as regards this arrangement over three years ago, according to Bloomberg. Their friendship as partners in this business has lasted and will hopefully last in the future.  The CEO of PayPal, Dan Schulman has been wheeling and dealing with various banks which are worth their weight in gold. They possess the Midas Touch. Also a number of credit card companies and wireless carriers have been invited to jump on the bandwagon and thus in the process PayPal has been converted into a far wider network. It used to be all about making payments on different websites. Now though it has become a pretty complex tool of financial transactions. Payments can be made in grocery stores and money can be transferred overseas. Even online shopping can occur via your smartphone using this proper channel.  PayPal has made inroads into stores and has gotten involved in various business institutions and practices which have all enhanced its reputation as a highly lucrative nexus. Now consumers use PayPal at the slightest nudge of economic choice thereby making it the ideal and preferred payment methodology for the 21st century. The partnership with Google will pay off in a big way in the times to come. It will build an ecosystem out of the world economy. The only impediment in the way to PayPal’s universality is Apple’s digital wallet which remains out of reach.   The link between Google and PayPal may lead to a merger in the near future. You never know what lies in the cards. PayPal originally split from its parent company, EBay. That was two years ago. It processed some $354 billion in transactions in 2016. The number of functional customers are close to 197 million for this huge financial exchange hub. As Google and PayPal work together they may become one if the conditions are right somewhere along the way.  This story may contain affiliate links.

Its explosive batteries got the handset recalled twice and banned on U.S. flights. To recover from the disaster, Samsung needed to create a smartphone that buried the still-smoldering remains of the Note7’s memories. And that’s exactly what the South Korean tech giant has done with its new Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. Available Friday, April 21 for $720 and $840, respectively, the 5.8-inch S8 and 6.2-inch S8 Plus are triumphs of design that make Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 7 and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Pixel look like dinosaurs. From its gorgeous all-screen design to its streamlined interface and high-speed performance, the S8 and S8 Plus are the smartphones to beat. Beautiful from front to back Samsung has been experimenting with curved-edge smartphones since it debuted the Galaxy Note Edge in 2015. The S8 and S8 Plus are the culmination of those efforts and prove the concept was well worth perfecting. The company’s Infinity Display wraps around the S8’s left and right sides and nearly touches its top and bottom edges. The result is a phone that looks like it’s one giant screen. View photos Samsung has moved the S8’s fingerprint reader to its rear panel. Right next to the phone’s camera, which was not a perfect choice.More A consequence of this design is that Samsung had to move the S8’s fingerprint reader to the phone’s rear panel. Google and LG took similar approaches with the Pixel and LG G6, but Samsung’s reader is just a hair too small, which can make it hard to find at first. Samsung also added facial scanning and iris recognition technology to the S8 and S8 Plus. Under the right lighting the features work well. But if you’re in a darker space or have a bright light shining in the camera’s direction those features will have a difficult time reading your face or eyes. To infinity … display Samsung is known for producing brilliant displays. But the company has outdone itself with the S8 and S8 Plus’ Super AMOLED screens. Colors are bright and vibrant, and blacks look endlessly deep. Next to the S8, the iPhone 7’s LED Retina HD display looks downright dull. The Pixel XL’s display, meanwhile, is colorful, but not nearly as bright as the S8. View photos The Galaxy S8’s display is the best of any smartphone screen.More The S8 and S8 Plus are also HDR (high dynamic range) capable, which means they can display a wider array of colors when viewing HDR compatible content. There still aren’t many shows or movies available that are HDR capable, though several Netflix (NFLX) originals, including “Daredevil” and “Luke Cage,” support the format. A camera repeat A fancy new camera is a huge selling point for a smartphone. But Samsung surprisingly decided to use the same camera from last year’s Galaxy S7 in the S8 and S8 Plus. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as the S7’s camera was an absolutely knockout. In fact, Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus was the only smartphone with a better camera thanks to its dual-lens optical zoom. View photos The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus capture impressive photos, like this flower, but can’t match the iPhone 7 Plus’ duel-lens optical zoom.More Read More And that’s the same case with the S8’s shooter. Images look sharp and colors are crisp and blend nicely; low-light shots are clear when taken without the flash. Samsung says it worked on its camera software to improve night shooting, while the iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel struggle with artifacts. But when it comes to zooming in on subjects, which is notoriously difficult for smartphones, the iPhone 7 Plus is still king. Bixby says, “Hello” … sort of Samsung’s new Bixby intelligent voice assistant is supposed to be the S8’s ace in the hole. Unfortunately, the voice part won’t work for U.S. consumers at launch. Bixby is Samsung’s big play at taking on Apple’s Siri and Google’s Google Assistant. Like Siri and Google Assistant, you can communicate with Bixby via voice commands — eventually — to ask questions like “Will it rain today?” or “Who played Frodo in ‘The Lord of the Rings’?” The app, which is accessible via a dedicated button on the S8’s left side, also lets you manage virtually every part of the S8 via your voice. According to Samsung, everything you can manipulate with your fingers can also be accessed using your voice; that should prove incredibly helpful for visually impaired users. View photos Samsung’s Bixby virtual assistant.More The app’s Bixby Vision feature uses the S8’s camera to scan objects and provide you with Amazon (AMZN) links to purchase them, or give you information about them. Scan a can of soda or a book, for example, and Bixby Vision will provide you with links to buy them via Amazon. It’s basically the same feature found in Amazon’s Android app. You can also use Bixby Vision to scan a business card and instantly import its owner’s contact information to the S8’s Contact’s app. And if you’re looking for the perfect meal for your bottle of wine, you can scan the bottle with Bixby and the app will tell you whether to go with beef or fish. Bixby Home serves as the app’s main hub, and lets you browse items ranging from the news and weather to your daily activity progress in Samsung’s S Health app and upcoming reminders. You can also see what’s trending on Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) and control your Spotify player. It doesn’t feel exactly new, though, as Google’s Google Now and Apple’s iOS Today View offer similar functionality. Power and performance The S8 includes a powerful 8-core processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Unlike the iPhone and Google’s Pixel, the S8’s storage can be increased via its microSD card slot. The S8 has to be so powerful because it’s designed to be used with Samsung’s new Dex desktop computer dock. A hockey puck-shaped device, the Dex lets you attach your S8 or S8 Plus to a computer monitor, mouse and keyboard and use it like a regular computer. Samsung has also designed its apps so that you can resize and move them to your liking when in desktop mode just like Windows and macOS apps. You’ll also be able to run Windows 10 on the S8 via a virtual machine app. View photos The S8 and S8 Plus will eventually work as desktop-style computers.More Unfortunately, there’s no word on when Dex will be available for purchase. The S8 and S8 Plus come equipped with 3,000-mAh and 3,500-mAh batteries, respectively. That’s good enough to get you through your workday and more. Of course, when your handset does die, you can always plug it into its fast charger to get it up and running quickly. Should you get them? The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are the most beautiful smartphones I’ve ever used. Their gorgeous displays make them look downright futuristic, and their cameras are top-notch even if they are from last year. The handsets’ powerful processors and batteries are icing on the cake. And while I’m not quite sold on whether Bixby is necessary, I might have a change of heart when Bixby Voice comes online in the U.S. For now, Samsung’s S8 and S8 Plus are my picks for the best smartphones around. Apple and Google are officially on notice.

Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is mesmerizingly close to perfection with its fantastic display, useful interface, and eye-catching design. Highs Gorgeous display Excellent build quality, design Useful software features and options TouchWiz is a lot prettier Water-resistant Lows Bixby is hardly useful Poor speaker placement $100 more expensive than S7 DT Editors' Rating 8.0 DT Editors' Choice Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Phone Reviews > Samsung Galaxy S8 review By Julian Chokkattu Posted on 04.18.17 Research Center: Samsung Galaxy S8 With pre-orders through the roof, it looks like Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus may be unmatched in sales this year (perhaps until the next iPhone at least). It’s certainly a win for the company, considering its new phones are $100 more than we’re used to paying. More importantly, this is Samsung’s first major device since it recalled the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7, and it looks like people are hungry for a successor. The Galaxy S8 is worth the hype and the wait since the year-old Galaxy S7 Edge (which frankly looks dated now with its home button). But in a time where you can get a fantastic smartphone for $400 or less, is it worth dropping $750 or more on the S8? We think so, if only for its brilliant screen, but it is a big ask if money is tight. The Galaxy S8 has exceptional build quality, design, and a stellar displays, not to mention plenty of power to crush any task. Let’s take a closer look. Brilliant screen, eye-catching design So far, the Galaxy S8 is the prettiest smartphone of 2017, and it will certainly be tough to beat. It’s smooth and soft to the touch, and the all-glass design means you won’t feel a disconnect between the back and the front of the smartphone — it’s seamless. But we can’t talk about the S8’s design without first addressing its brilliant screen. Both the S8 and the S8 Plus have a resolution of 2,960 × 1,440 pixels, allowing for crisp image quality. The Super AMOLED screen gets impressively bright, offers darker blacks, and its mobile HDR Premium certification means it boasts greater color volume, meaning you can watch colorful High-Dynamic Range (HDR) content, which is the new hot thing in video. This has the best screen we’ve ever seen on a smartphone. To showcase this vibrant display, Samsung added skimpy bezels (edges around the screen) on the top and bottom, and utilized its Edge display. As such, the screen takes up 83 percent of the front panel, and it’s absolutely the first thing anyone will notice on the phone. It looks “futuristic,” my sister told me; she hardly cares or pays attention to technology at all. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends The bigger display improves the smartphone experience. Even sending an email feels nice because the screen makes well-designed apps look even more gorgeous. But while eliminating bezels may be the current smartphone trend, gripping the phone without triggering the screen is difficult. It takes some getting used to, but that’s because we have to rethink smartphone sizes, and what they mean. The Galaxy S8 Plus is 6.2-inches, and the S8 is 5.8-inches — those are some of the largest screens we’ve seen on a smartphone. But as the screens have gotten larger, the smartphone’s frame has stayed nearly the same size. The curved edge-to-edge screen coupled with minimal bezels make it tough to grab the phone from a flat surface at first, for example, but it gets easier after a few hours. You also may find yourself accidentally triggering the screen when gripping the phone (more so with the S8 Plus), but again we adapted fairly quickly. You probably will, too. The all-glass design means the phone is slippery and fragile, not to mention a fingerprint magnet. (Make sure you grab a case and keep a microfiber cloth handy at all times.) You’ll find the power button on the right side, and the volume rocker and Bixby button on the left. Bixby is Samsung’s new Siri, and we’ll talk more about it later. The headphone jack is on the bottom, to the left of the USB Type-C port. To the right of that port is the phone’s sole speaker, which is bottom-firing, like the iPhone. This has the best screen we’ve ever seen on a smartphone. The decision to only go with one bottom-firing speaker is unfortunate. As is the case with most single, bottom-firing speakers — such as the ones on the Pixel and the LG G6 — our hands end up blocking sound when holding the phone horizontally. The S8’s speaker quality is pretty good, but it doesn’t get as loud as the iPhone 7. The back of the phone feels like an afterthought, though perhaps it’s simply overshadowed by the beauty of the front. There’s nothing special about it. The design looks almost the same as the Galaxy S7. The camera sits flush, next to the flash and heart rate sensor, and a fingerprint sensor. That’s right, for the first time Samsung has removed the home button from the front of the phone. Despite the rumors, the company hasn’t embedded a fingerprint sensor in the display so you’ll have to use the one on the rear. This causes two major problems, but we’ll dive into that later. Samsung makes some of the best smartphone hardware, and the Galaxy S8 series is all the evidence you need. Both models feel incredibly smooth, thin, and the construction is seamless. We suggest opting for the S8 over the S8 Plus, because it’s compact and far easier to hold. Top specs The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are the first phones to feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor (international variants use Samsung’s Exynos 8895), which means it’s supposed to deliver 27 percent better performance than phones that use the Snapdragon 821, such as the Google Pixel and the OnePlus 3T. Qualcomm also claims the 835 is more energy efficient, though we haven’t seen a noticeable improvement in battery life from last year. You’ll find both S8’s have 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage — though you can expand it with the MicroSD card slot. Initially, we ran into a horrible bug. Our Galaxy S8 Plus was stuttering all over the place, particularly in the notification drawer and the Recent apps section. A factory reset fixed the issue, and we’ve tested each of our originally installed apps to figure out what caused the issue, but we can’t figure out what went wrong. We’ll update this review if we run into the problem again. So far, it was an isolated problem. Now, the S8 flies with almost zero hiccups. We tested games such as Asphalt Xtreme and FIFA Mobile, and found no performance issues. Dawn of Titans ran well for the most part, but we did see some occasional stutters. We had no problems moving through apps and multitasking. We ran through some benchmark tests, and the Snapdragon 835 more or less outperformed the Google Pixel’s Snapdragon 821: 3DMark SlingShot Extreme: 2052 AnTuTu: 155253 Geekbench 4: 1762 single core, 5723 multi core For reference, with Geekbench 4 the Pixel earned 1,665 in single core and 3,691 in multi-core; the iPhone 7 Plus received 3,367 in single core and 5,491 in multi-core. We’re hoping we don’t see the initial issues again, and we’re enjoying the smooth performance from the Snapdragon 835. Still, we don’t think the Galaxy S8 offers smoother day-to-day performance than the Pixel, and that’s likely because Google can optimize its software and hardware far better than anyone else (except Apple). Samsung phones also tend to slow down a little over time, so we’ll keep you updated if anything changes. TouchWiz UI is stylish TouchWiz, Samsung’s Android skin, has never been the company’s forte. At times, it had a less than appealing design, and bogged down the operating system. That has changed with the Galaxy S8. There is a clear, attractive design aesthetic — with uniform app icons and slick fonts. The lack of a physical home button also gives the smartphone a more modern look. Samsung has embedded a pressure-sensitive home button at the bottom-center — it’s not just an on-screen button, because you can press and hold it to go home even in full-screen apps or if the screen is off. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends One of the first things I did when setting up the S8, was reverse the layout of the navigation icons. Samsung has gone against every other Android manufacturer for years, offering the Recent apps icon on the left, and the back button on the right. Well, on the S8 you can finally reverse it thanks to the on-screen navigation icons. Choice is a prevalent in Samsung’s latest interface. You can choose where you want the brightness slider on the notification drawer; you can customize the display resolution; turn the Edge screen on and off; toggle Bixby on or off; use the LED indicator or not; turn on basic swipe gestures for the fingerprint sensor … you get the idea. There are a ton of features in this phone — most of which have been in Galaxy devices for a while — and they all feel polished and useful. There is a clear, attractive design aesthetic. I recall using Smart Stay on my Samsung Galaxy Captivate back in 2011 — it keeps the screen on as long as your eyes are staring at it. It was far from good then, but it’s useful on the S8. Multitasking also offers more options than any other Android device — in splitscreen mode, you can reverse the app position or trigger picture-in-picture mode. You can even swipe from the top corners of any supported app to make it a floating window, and it works surprisingly well. Even Bluetooth is improved. The Galaxy S8 is the first smartphone to utilize Bluetooth 5, which has 4x the range of Bluetooth 4.2, 8x the data throughput, and 2x the data speed. That means you can walk up to 200 meters (in direct line of sight) from your device and still listen via your Bluetooth-connected earbuds — that’s a lot further than ever before. The upgrade means you can stream music to two different Bluetooth devices at the same time. We connected a pair of Bose wireless headphones and a speaker from Cambridge Audio — the two played music perfectly in sync, and the pairing process took less than 1 minute. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends The facial recognition technology on the Galaxy S8 is also noteworthy. Sure, it may not work 100 percent of the time — especially if you’re moving or are in a darker environment — but it was often faster than using the fingerprint sensor. You can also choose to use the iris (eye) scanner, though we didn’t find it as effective. The fingerprint on the rear is the third option, and here’s where those two downsides come into play. The fingerprint sensor is almost impossible to reach on the Galaxy S8 Plus — and that’s coming from someone with large hands. And even if it is reachable, you probably won’t make use of the fingerprint gestures, because the placement is so unnatural. The second problem is how your fingers will naturally touch the camera sensor on both models. Samsung knows this is a problem, and even warns you to clean the camera often to make sure there are no smudges. But it all could have been avoided if they placed the sensor lower, like almost every other Android phones that opts for a rear sensor. All in all, the software experience on the Galaxy S8 is surprisingly useful, and you can toggle most options on or off to your heart’s content. Stellar shots in the right conditions The 12-megapixel rear camera hasn’t changed much from the Galaxy S7. That’s not a bad thing. The S7 also offered stellar photos. In broad daylight, Galaxy S8 photos have great picture quality and accurate colors, but things were a little trickier in different lighting conditions. Occasionally, we had to take a photo twice to make sure it wasn’t blurry. Low-light photos sometimes suffered in picture clarity, but other times photos were relatively sharp in dark environments. We wish Samsung had done something different, new, or exciting with the rear camera, like a dual-camera setup. At least there are quite a few modes to choose from, including Selective Focus (like Apple’s Portrait Mode), Panorama, and even a Pro mode, where you can change the shutter speed, focus, and ISO if you’re more experienced with a camera. But the 8-megapixel front-facing camera is where the camera experience shines, largely because it comes with a variety of stickers, filters, and masks, similar to what you’d find in Snapchat. They’re fun, and work pretty well. We imagine they’ll take off in popularity if Samsung adds new content often (they even work on groups). Speaking of groups, Samsung has a “Wide Selfie” mode that lets you snap a photo, then twist the camera to your left and right to capture your friends. The photos are stitched together and the end result is surprisingly seamless. It’s a neat way to add group selfie capability without using a wide-angle lens. Bixby? Bixby? Are you there? If Bixby, Samsung’s new digital assistant, piqued your interest in picking up a Galaxy S8, you will be disappointed. Voice commands are not available yet and won’t be here until “later this spring.” So that leaves Bixby Home, Reminder, and Vision. Home is an assortment of random information, such as your current step count, next calendar event, the weather, what’s trending on Twitter, and even a random GIF from Giphy that we’re not really sure how to use. It’s so much easier and faster to go into these respective apps, because the Bixby button is ridiculously slow and unreliable at activating Bixby Home. Reminders is the equivalent to setting reminders on Google Inbox or with Google Assistant (which is also available on the S8 by pressing and holding the home button). You can stream music to two different Bluetooth devices at the same time. That leaves Vision, which is arguably the most useful feature of the bunch at the moment, but it’s use cases are limited to specific moments, like when you see a shoe and want to shop for something similar — point the camera to the product and tap the Bixby icon. You’ll be directed to an Amazon search link, or Bixby can show more images of similar products. I’ve used it once or twice, and it largely feels like a gimmick. Your mileage may vary, though. Bixby very much feels like an unfinished product. If the assistant is one of the reasons you’re excited about the Galaxy S8, don’t expect it to be as useful as Samsung claims. Average daylong battery The Galaxy S8 Plus packs a 3,500mAh battery, while the smaller S8 has a 3,000mAh capacity. We found the S8 Plus to last a full day with moderate to heavy use — we ended up with around 25 percent around 8 p.m. after a long day of taking photos, music streaming, and browsing. On a day with regular use — where we checked and responded to notifications, listened to music, and did some light browsing — we came home with a little under 40 percent by 6 p.m. We’ll need to spend more time with the Galaxy S8 to see how long it lasts, but we’re expecting more or less the same results due to the smaller screen. Samsung Galaxy S8 Compared To LG G6 HTC U Ultra Huawei P10 OnePlus 3T Lenovo Moto G5 Plus Meizu Pro 6 Plus Xiaomi Mi Mix Huawei Mate 9 ASUS Zenfone 3 Deluxe Special… Lenovo Phab 2 Pro HTC Bolt Lenovo Moto Z Nexus 6 HTC One Remix Huawei Ascend Mate 2 Both devices support high-speed wireless charging, which is always a plus, as is the USB Type-C connector, which is probably new for you, but will soon be a standard on most devices. Warranty information Samsung offers a standard 1 year warranty for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus. That covers manufacturing defects, but not much else. The company has started an advanced warranty program called Premium Care, which will run you $12 per month (first month is free). This plan covers accidental drops, cracked screens, water damage, and mechanical defects. Samsung will provide you with a new or reconditioned device, though you’ll have to pay a $99 deductible. The device is either shipped or hand-delivered to you. With Premium Care, you also get access to help via HelloTech, a company that will send authorized technicians to teach you about all the features on your phone. Our Take The Galaxy S8, in both its sizes, is an excellent smartphone with great build quality, a fantastic screen, solid cameras, and standard daylong-battery life. The Bixby voice assistant is underwhelming, but you can turn it off and opt for Google Assistant instead (or use both). Bixby will get better over time, we hope. The DT Accessory Pack Samsung DeX Station $149.99 Samsung Gear 360 (2017 Edition) $399 Samsung Gear VR (2017 Edition) with Controller $199 Samsung Gear S3 Frontier $299.99 If you prefer compact phones, the standard Galaxy S8 is your best bet. The S8 Plus might have slightly longer battery life, but it’s unwieldy for many hands (especially reaching that fingerprint sensor). Are there better alternatives? Yes. There are a ton of good smartphones that cost less than the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, such as the Google Pixel and the LG G6, or even the iPhone 7 if you’re not looking for an Android device. We also recommend a number of cheaper smartphones. However, none compare to the Galaxy S8’s display. How long will it last? It should last you a little longer than two years. Samsung, and most Android manufacturers, stop supporting devices after two years. Expect the S8 to receive the same treatment. You should know that Samsung also delivers software updates far later than when Google rolls them out, so don’t expect the next annual version of Android (Android O) any time soon after its release this fall. Should you buy it? Yes. If you have $750 or more to spare, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are among the best Android smartphones you can buy right now. It’s an incredible amount of money, though, and you should note the plentiful number of more affordable options. Still, if you’re eyeing the S8, you’re likely looking for the cream of the crop. Well, you’ve found it.

Google artificial intelligence will be put to work for Earth users in the form of “knowledge cards” that let them dive deeper into online information about mountains, countries, landmarks or other places being virtually visited. It will also make suggestions on other locations armchair explorers might be interested in exploring based on what they have searched in the past. “This is the first time we have done this deep integration with the Google Knowledge Graph,” Earth engineering manager Sean Askay said. “Everything Google knows about the world, you can know about the world.” There is also a newly installed “Feeling Lucky?” feature for people who want to let the software suggest hidden gems such as Pemba Island off the Swahili coast or the Oodaira Hot Spring in Yamagata, Japan. People can choose to fly around the world in Earth, using a 3—D button to see the Grand Canyon, Chateau Loire Valley and other stunning spots from any angles they wish. “With the new Earth, we want to open up different lenses for you to see the world and learn a bit about how it all fits together; to open your mind with new stories while giving you a new perspective on the locations and experiences you cherish,” Earth product manager Gopal Shah said in a blog post. Online explorers cruising the mobile version of Earth can also capture pictures on their travels, sending friends digital postcards. New Earth was launched on Google’s Chrome and Android software, with versions tailored for Apple devices and other internet browsing software promised soon. It’s the first time that Earth can be reached on a web browser instead of through applications installed on devices. The move allows Google to tap into more powerful computing power at data centers in the internet “cloud” instead of relying on the capabilities of smartphones and other devices.
