 Google bought a company that helps brands get product placements in YouTube videos Steve Kovach Oct. 11, 2016, 3:31 PM 4,226 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google announced Tuesday that it bought Famebit, a company that helps brands work with YouTube creators for marketing their products. Famebit is basically a way for companies to get product placement in videos posted by popular YouTube users. Google did not say how much it paid for Famebit, but Famebit will continue to run independently from Google for now, according to the announcement. To give you an idea of what Famebit does, here's an example of a video one of the company's creators made to help promote an app called Best Friends: This is the third acquisition this year for the Los Angeles-based startup studio Science Inc after exits from Dollar Shave Club and Hello Society. Science owned the majority of the three-year-old startup. And here's the full announcement from Google: Nine years ago, YouTube launched its Partner Program with the goal of helping creators earn advertising revenue while connecting their innovative content to audiences around the world. Every year, more and more brands are making YouTube essential to their marketing strategy. In fact, in the last year alone, the top 100 advertisers have increased their spend on YouTube video ads by 50 percent. As brands continue to embrace the value of YouTube, they’re also taking their investments one step further, partnering with creators on branded content opportunities such as product placements, promotions and sponsorships. As we look to the future, we want even more creators and brands to come together and realize the benefits of these creative collaborations. Today, we’re excited to announce that Google has acquired FameBit -- a technology platform company that helps creators and brands find and work with each other through sponsorships and paid promotion. We believe that Google’s relationship with brands and YouTube’s partnerships with creators, combined with FameBit’s technology and expertise, will help increase the number of branded content opportunities available, bringing even more revenue into the online video community. Creators will always have the choice in how they work with brands, and there are many great companies who provide this service today. This acquisition doesn’t change that. Our hope is that FameBit’s democratized marketplace will allow creators of all sizes to directly connect with brands, as well as provide a great technology solution for companies like MCNs and agencies to find matches for their creators and brand partners. We look forward to seeing FameBit and the entire branded content space thrive as we continue to support the success and creativity of the creator community.

The annual ritual is, after all, one of the touchstones of the tech industry. But they turned out to be wrong. It wasn’t about Google’s new Pixel phones. Nor was it about the Home smart speaker. It was about the connective tissue binding them—Google Assistant, the company’s artificial intelligence (AI), a beefed up version of a prior attempt, Google Now. And that raises a number of questions that are proliferating increasingly at the intersection of technology and ethics. AI routines running under the hood of various digital services and products, and on personal computing devices—think Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana—have been commonplace for a few years now. But Google Assistant, along with its predecessor and rival Amazon’s Alexa, is taking aim at something larger. It’s a seductive vision—ubiquitous environmental AI able to respond to voice input anywhere in the house, sophisticated enough to understand natural language and context and carry on a conversation with the user in the process of offering information and performing tasks such as scheduling appointments or locking the door. The hubs currently take the form of small speakers—Google Home and Amazon Echo, powered by Assistant and Alexa, respectively—but this is the embryonic stage. Google’s ambition is to have multiple hubs or portals in the house. As the Internet of Things inches towards realization, every networked component in the environment—from televisions to refrigerators—could be part of this ecosystem. And others will follow suit; rumour has it Apple is working on its own offering. This is a future pop culture has been preparing us for since Gene Roddenberry first had Captain Kirk talk to the Enterprise’s computer back in the 1960s. That might explain the ease with which consumers are taking to the concept of voice input. Earlier this year, Mary Meeker’s annual “Internet Trends” report showed that Google voice queries have grown 35-fold since 2008 and that Amazon’s Echo was the fastest-selling speaker in 2015. But consumers’ comfort with this vision of AI-enabled lives masks issues of privacy that warrant careful consideration. For consumer AI to offer the ease of use that will make it attractive, it must offer as close a facsimile of having a conversation with another person as possible. This is immensely difficult; the ability to understand natural language conversation in context rather than predetermined commands is the holy grail. Two components are necessary: sophisticated algorithms and vast amounts of data. And that includes every scrap of personal data possible. Data privacy concerns used to largely be the preserve of policy wonks and the tinfoil hat crowd until a few years ago. Multiple leaks and revelations, from WikiLeaks to Edward Snowden, changed all that. But the public focus remains for the most part on government snooping. When it comes to private actors, consumers are voting with their wallets; lack of privacy and surrendering personal data is a fair price to pay for more convenient lifestyles. Is this necessarily a negative? That depends on the best practices tech companies develop—Apple, for instance, is focusing on protecting users’ data in order to differentiate its products—and on the outcome of their ongoing tussles with governments around the world that demand access to user data for legal purposes. It does, however, point to those ethical questions that the rise of AI is throwing up. The industry is well aware of these questions, and of the need to show that it is taking concerns on board. Thus, Amazon, Facebook, Google’s DeepMind division, IBM and Microsoft founding a new organization called the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society that aims to initiate a wide dialogue about the nature, purpose and consequences of AI. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also been harping on the issue for a while now; last year, he was among the founders of OpenAI, another organization aimed at addressing such issues. They have their work cut out. AI ethics have much more to address than just user privacy. Imagine, for instance, a bank using AI to recommend or screen loan applicants, and the algorithm using causal relationships to discriminate on the basis of gender or caste or race. Or, for that matter, the multiple implications of AI deployed in a military context or controlling driverless vehicles—or the issue du jour, employment. These are also eminently plausible scenarios. It’s an inevitable future; technological genies can never really be put back in the bottle. But the rise of AI cannot be left to the industry; it demands the involvement of everyone from social scientists to ethicists and philosophers. Social and technological paradigm shifts are rarely painless, after all. Is giving up privacy in exchange for the convenience of AI a fair deal?

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google wants to know where you have coffee, dinner and tequila shots By Ethan Baron / October 11, 2016 at 3:04 PM It’s for your own good. The more Google knows about every little thing you do and every place you go, the better it can serve your needs. At least that’s the rationale behind the data grabbing that allows the firm to provide personalized service — via everything from its “Assistant” virtual helper to “enhanced search results”  — and to sell ads specifically and lucratively targeted at individual users. Now, according to a patent Google received Tuesday for “systems and methods for generating a user location history,” the company isn’t satisfied with knowing your location by its GPS or map coordinates. Google wants to know when you’re at home, when you’re at which coffee shop, where you’re eating dinner, and to which bar you go to drink with friends. “Raw location data can fail to identify a particular entity (e.g. restaurant, park, or other point of interest) that the user was visiting at the time,” said Google’s patent document, from a March 2015 application. “Use of the raw data in furtherance of location-enhanced services can fail to provide any contextual information that would more appropriately personalize the location-enhanced services.” So, Google wants to know all the “particular location entities” — restaurants, parks, coffee shops –where you’ve set foot. “A typical day may include morning activities at home, a breakfast at a coffee shop, time spent at work, and then an afternoon happy hour with friends at a restaurant prior to returning home,” the document said. The fact that a user went to happy hour is not enough. Google must know where, exactly, the cheap drinks and greasy appies were guzzled and gobbled. Here’s an example of what the patent envisions: “According to the user’s location history, on Sept. 18, 2013 the user was at the user’s home at about 9:30 AM; spent about 20 minutes in the Mission District area; was at the user’s workplace from about 10:30 AM to 8:30 PM; spent about 1 hour in the Visticon Valley area; was at The Whiskey Club bar from about 10:45 PM to 11:15 PM; was at Coffee Shop from about 11:30 PM to 11:45 PM; and then returned home at midnight.” How, then, would Google figure out which places you visited? By combing through all the other personal data it can collect on you, from emails you’ve sent and received, to photographs you’ve taken, to receipts from mobile-payment purchases you’ve made, to your requests for directions, to the content of your social media posts and, of course, to your search history, according to the patent document. The document is a little ambiguous on whether a user would have to consent to having the location-identification system collecting their personal information, saying only that a person “may” have to agree to it. One might ask, ‘What’s in it for the user?’ Plenty, according to Google. Say you forgot the name of the Thai restaurant where you dined last Thursday, a scenario explored in the patent document. By knowing exactly where you were last Thursday night, Google could tell you! But there’s more: Your location history would let Google serve you “location-enhanced” search results, and improve your use of social media, mapping applications or “other suitable applications.” Aside from the bit about helping you remember where you ate dinner last week, the patent document is a little vague on the actual enhancements. Now we come to the crown jewel of this system:  the “interactive user interface.” Guaranteed to be revolutionary in terms of our understanding of our own previous movements upon the earth, this geographic chronicle could take the form of a “graphical representation.” While the system would allow a user to edit, correct and annotate their location history, and supplement entries with uploaded photos and customer reviews, the interface appears to be primarily a means for Google to confirm the locations it has determined you visited, so advertisers can have confidence that when they’re buying targeted advertising, it’s actually on target. As the document says, using a female user as an example, the interface “offers an opportunity for the user to confirm that she did in fact visit Pizza Napoletana at the specified time.” Not all patented technologies make it to market, but for those of us anxious to give Google as much access to our personal lives as possible, this detailed location history would take us a giant step forward. And in case you’re concerned that your friends might shy away from allowing Brother Google to penetrate so deeply into their private lives, and that they would thus miss out on the enhancements and the interactive interface, you can go ahead and tell Google where they were. “Opportunities can be provided,” the document said, “for the user to confirm the presence of one or more additional users that visited the location entity with the user.”   Photo: A man walks past a building on the Google campus in Mountain View. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)     Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: Google, location history, patent, personal data, personal information, Privacy   More Posts in 1 Petition for electoral college coup against Trump gets more than 1 million signatures November 10, 2016   Apple now selling pre-owned iPhones from online store November 9, 2016   Google’s driving app ‘Android Auto’ now works as free standalone on phones November 8, 2016       Share this Post Tweet       Rich B Scary stuff from Google, and the tech world in general.

Here Are the Best Phones to Replace It Thanks to a series of unfortunate fires, millions of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 owners need to return their phones immediately. In some cases, for the second time. Since the Galaxy Note 7 is officially out of circulation, never to return, you may be wondering what would best fill that smartphone-sized hole in your heart. Don’t worry! You’ve got options. Non-incendiary options. Pixel XL ($770) You got the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 because it’s a big, powerful Android smartphone, right? The upcoming Pixel XL checks those boxes, has one of the best cameras on the market, and, along with the smaller Pixel, will be the only Android device to offer Google Assistant, Mountain View’s super-smart AI helper, at launch. The big caveat here is that most models are out of stock, and the one configuration that’s left (silver, 32GB) has a 5-6 week shipping time. You don’t want to risk using your Note 7 that long, but if you have something lying round to bridge the gap, Pixel XL’s your best bet.

Google Nexus 6P ($500) The Nexus 6P is a year old, but it has the distinct advantage of being available right now. Don’t let that age necessarily put you off it, either; it’s a solidly built, big-screen, pure Android device with a great camera and a very accommodating price. At the very least, it’s a safe bet to tide you over until whenever the Note 8 comes along. Google doesn’t sell it directly anymore, outside of its Project Fi carrier program, but you can snag one on Amazon.

Apple iPhone 7 Plus ($770) Okay, okay, switching from iOS to Android (and vice versa) comes with its share of headaches. But the iPhone 7 Plus is the absolute best big smartphone available, especially with the Galaxy Note 7 out of commission. You’d be crazy not to at least consider it. Besides, most of your stuff’s in the cloud by now anyway, meaning it may not be as bad a transition as you’d think.

Moto Z Force Droid Edition ($720) The latest Motorola line can be a bit confusing; there are four different models, that all work with an array of swappable hardware add-ons. Let us simplify it: If you liked the Note 7, you should get the Moto Z Force Droid, which has a shatterproof display, 40 hours of battery life, and a souped up camera. Just be aware that it’s Verizon-only. Credit: Motorola The latest Motorola line can be a bit confusing; there are four different models, that all work with an array of swappable hardware add-ons.

If you’re a Samsung fan, though, and appreciate its TouchWiz software touches, you can do a lot worse than the Galaxy S7 Edge. It’s like the Note 7’s adorable kid brother, and it won’t singe your carpet. (And with a 5.5-inch curved display, it’s still plenty big.)

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Android 7.1 set for December release by Wayne Manion  6:02 PM on October 11, 2016 When Google showed off Android 7.1 Nougat and the new Pixel phones at the company's hardware event last week, the search giant said that Nexus devices would receive an update to 7.1 sometime later in 2016. Dave Burke, the VP of Engineering for Android, announced today via blog post that a preview version of the point release will be released for the Nexus 5X, 6P and Pixel C later in October. The final version of 7.1 will be released in December. Owners of Nexus phones older than the Nexus 6 should not plan on receiving any officially-sanctioned update to Android 7.1. The Nexus 6, 5X, 6P, 9, Nexus Player, the Pixel C, "and supported Android One devices" are on the list to receive the final release of Android 7.1 in December. The Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 are actually past their support window according to Google's support list, but those devices will be updated to 7.1 anyway. Google's two-year support window pales in comparison to Apple's current software support for devices going as far back as the 2012-vintage iPhone 5. When Google fully rolls out Android 7.1, the non-Pixel machines will still lack some of the features found in the new Pixel phones. The Pixel launcher, Google Assistant, and some cosmetic tweaks will continue to differentiate Pixel devices from the rest of the Android landscape. All devices with Android 7.1 will be able to take advantage of new SDKs and other developer features, though.

YouTube did not disclose financial terms of the deal to buy FameBit, which it described as a technology platform that helps creators and brands make matches leading to sponsorships or paid promotions. "We believe that Google's relationship with brands and YouTube's partnerships with creators, combined with FameBit's technology and expertise, will help increase the number of branded content opportunities available," YouTube product management vice president Ariel Bardin said in an online post. The end goal is to bring more revenue to the community of online video creators that are central to YouTube. Nine years ago YouTube launched a "partner program" designed to help video creators earn advertising money and gain viewers. In the past year, the top 100 advertisers have increased the amount spent on YouTube video ads by 50 percent, according to Bardin. "As we look to the future, we want even more creators and brands to come together and realize the benefits of these creative collaborations," Bardin said. Southern California-based FameBit will continue as a standalone operation for now, co-founders David Kierzkowski and Agnes Kozera said in a message posted on its website. "With Google's relationship with brands large and small, and YouTube's partnership with creators around the globe, we hope to connect even more brands to creators, engage more audiences, and make brand marketing more creative and authentic than ever," the FameBit co-founders said.

However, Google is set to release Chrome 55 on December 6 with an upgraded JavaScript engine that 'significantly reduces the memory footprint'. The search giant says the new system has shown to use 50 percent less RAM than Chrome 53 and a 40 percent decrease in memory zone - which corresponds to a major boost in performance for users. Scroll down for video  Google is set to release Chrome 55 on December 6 with an upgraded JavaScript engine that 'significantly reduces the memory footprint. It use 50 percent less RAM than Chrome 53 and 40 percent less memory on sites like Imgur, Twitter and Reddit thanks to the new update CHROME'S NEW UPDATE  Google is set to release Chrome 55 in December. This update will included an upgraded JavaScript engine that 'significantly reduces the memory footprint'. Google is already testing the system and says it uses 50 percent less RAM than Chrome 53 and decreased by 40 percent in memory zone. Once PC and smartphone makers began rolling out more memory in their machines, programmers took it as a window of opportunity and made features that take full advantage, according to Stephen Shankland with CNET who first reported on the matter. But now that users will be using less RAM, Chrome will allow them to keep more tabs open and more apps running without slowing down the computer's performance. This new update is also great for those who forget to close Chrome tabs or quit apps. 'Memory consumption is an important dimension in the JavaScript virtual machine performance trade-off space,' Michael Hablich wrote in the V8 JavaScript Engine blog.

Share this article Share 97 shares 'Over the last few months the V8 team analyzed and significantly reduced the memory footprint of several websites that were identified as representative of modern web development patterns.' In May, Google took the crown from Microsoft in the battle of the browsers. Findings reveals that for the month of April, Google Chrome held 41.6 percent share of all desktop browser traffic picked up by web tracker, reports NetMarketShare. Now that users will be using less RAM, Chrome will allow them to keep more tabs open and more apps running without slowing down the computer's performance. This new update is also great for those who forget to close Chrome tabs or quit apps This victory was a 2.6 percent jump from March and a .3 percent lead over Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which has dropped from 43.4 percent to 41.3 percent o from April to May. NetMarketShare reviews unique visits and weighs its data against all other internet traffic around the world. Although other statistics claim Google overtook its arch rival months ago, it is the first time the NetMarketShare results have favored Google. GOOGLE HIT WITH ANTITRUST CHARGES IN EUROPE  Google has been accused by the European Commission of 'stifling competition' by abusing the dominant position of its Android operating system. The EU Anti-Trust Commission has alleged the technology giant breached competition rules by preventing consumers from 'having as wide a choice as possible'. The commission claims Google was making manufacturers pre-install Google Search and the Chrome browser. In a statement of objections to the US tech firm, the Commission told Google it had breached EU competition law. It said that if found guilty the company faces a heavy fine and would be forced to clean up its act. Google has allegedly given financial incentives to manufacturers and mobile network operators if they exclusively pre-installed Google Search on their devices. It has also blocked some manufacturers from selling smartphones which ran on 'competing operating systems based on the Android open source code'. The Commission believes these moves have stopped other mobile browsers from being able to compete with Google in the rapidly growing smartphone and Android markets. Google has been given until the end of October, the fourth extension, to rebut EU antitrust charges, the European Commission said early this month. And even though the two search giants are going head-to-head for the top spot, the two left the rest of the contenders in the dust. Firefox trailed behind at a mere 9.76 percent, followed by Safari with 4.91 percent, Opera and Konqueror didn't even hit two percent combined. All of the lagging browsers, except for Firefox, seem to have maintained a constant amount of traffic since June 2015– even if they are smaller numbers. Although Google Chrome is a memory hog, it is also seemed the most popular web browser. Findings reveals that for the month of April, Google Chrome held 41.6 percent share of all desktop browser traffic picked up by web tracker HOW MUCH TRAFFIC DOES EACH BROWSER HOLD?  Chrome: 41.6% Internet Explorer: 41.3% FireFox: 9.76% Safari: 4.91% Opera:1.89% Konqueror: 0.01%  Source: NetMarketShare  But Internet Explorer has been slowly plunging. During June 2015, Microsoft owned half of the desktop browser market, but has not been able to climb back up since.  What some may find interesting is that Internet Explorer comes bundled on all Window desktops. Users have to download Chrome in order to use it, which is what some say played a role in the higher market share – but doesn't explain the current decline. Chrome has been gaining traction since Internet Explorer started taking a dive. The software was built by several Mozilla Firefox developers who created the demonstration, which ultimately changed Schmidt's way of thinking. Chrome was unveiled in the official beta version in 2008 and within the first month owned one percent of the shares but fell to 0.69 percent by the following month. It seems Mac Pro users aren't the only ones using Chrome as their default search engine, as the US government's Digital Analytics Program (DAP) has confirmed Chrome as the most popular browser with 43.3 percent of the usage and Internet Explore only had 19.4.   Read more: ​Google Chrome soon won't be such a burden on your computer - CNET Market share for mobile, browsers, operating systems and search engines | NetMarketShare Share or comment on this article e-mail 97 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How (and Why) to Port Your Old Phone Number to Google Voice If you want to keep your old phone number after you got a new one, or you just want a second phone number to play around with, you can port that number to the awesome Google Voice service. Here’s how to do it. RELATED ARTICLES 8 Reasons You Should Be Using Google Voice (If You’re American) How to Enable Wi-Fi Calling on an Android Phone Why Would I Want to Do This? If you recently switched carriers and got a new phone number, but you want to keep your old phone number lying around just in case, you can port it to Google Voice so that you don’t have to pay for a second plan. Calls to your old number will get forwarded to your new one, and you’ll never miss an important call because someone forgot to update their address book. Sure, you can get a new phone from Google Voice and use it for texting and call forwarding too. However, if you have an existing number that you want to use with Google Voice, you can port it to the service and use that instead. What’s the Catch? First, porting a phone number to Google Voice requires a one-time fee of $20. Secondly, when you port a number to Google Voice, you can’t use the Google Voice app to send text messages–it requires a data connection over Wi-Fi or LTE/3G. You can, however, have Google Voice forward texts to your new number. When you reply to them using your regular messaging app, they will appear to come from your Google Voice number, which is pretty cool. The same goes for making and receiving calls–as long as you have call forwarding turned on, you can make and receive calls from your Google Voice number, even without a data connection. Lastly, to port a number to Google Voice, you need two phone numbers: Your old phone number, which you are porting to Google Voice. This number must still be active when you start the porting process–do not cancel your account yet! Your new phone number, to which you’ll forward your Google Voice calls and texts. This can be a number on a new carrier, or on the same carrier you currently use. In my case, I was switching to a new carrier (Cricket), so I just started a new account with them, and ported my Verizon number over. When I did so, Google cancelled my Verizon account for me. If you’re getting a new number on the same carrier, you’ll just have to add a number to your account, after which Google Voice will cancel the old number for you. Make sure you aren’t in the middle of a contract, since porting your number could incur an early termination fee (ETF) from your carrier! If you aren’t sure, call customer service and make sure they make a note on your account not to charge you an ETF when you cancel. How to Port Your Phone Number The first step is to head to www.google.com/voice. If you’ve never used Google Voice before, you’ll go through the process of accepting the terms and services agreement before you can start using it. Then you’ll skip these first few steps. If you’re an existing user, click on the settings gear icon in the top-right corner and select “Settings”. Select the “Phones” tab if it isn’t already selected. Next to your current Google Voice number, click “Change/Port”. Keep in mind that porting a number into Google Voice will replace your current Google Voice number after 90 days, but you can pay an extra $20 to keep that number (so you’ll end up with two Voice numbers). Next, click on “I want to use my mobile number”. If you’re a new Google Voice user, this will be the first screen you see after accepting the terms and services. Type in the phone number that you want to port over, and then click “Check for available options”. Click on “Port your number”. Click on the checkboxes and read all the things you’ll need to understand before the porting process. Then click “Next: Phone Verification”. The next step is confirming that you actually own and operate the phone number that you’re porting over, so Google Voice will call you at that number and then you’ll enter in the two-digit number shown on the screen on your phone’s keypad. Click on “Call me now” to begin that process. Once that process is done, enter in your carrier plan account information, like the account number, PIN, last four social security number digits, and so on. In my case, this was my Verizon account info. Then click on “Next: Confirmation”. Make sure all of the details are correct and then click on “Next: Google Payments”. If you have a credit card on file with Google, you can go ahead and click “Buy” when the pop-up appears. If not, you’ll need to enter in your credit card details before continuing. After the purchase, you’ll receive a “Purchase Confirmation” pop-up. Click “Done” to complete the process. On the next page, you’ll be reminded about a few things, like how your existing Google Voice number will be replaced (unless you want to keep it for $20 more), as well as how you’ll need to connect a new phone number to your Google Voice account as a forwarding phone. At this point, all that’s left to do is wait for the porting process to complete, which can take up to 24 hours, with text messaging capabilities taking up to three business days to fully complete. In the meantime, a yellow status bar will appear at the top in Google Voice, saying that your phone number is in the process of being ported. How to Forward Calls to Your Main Number Once you have your old phone number ported over to Google Voice, you can use it to text message anyone, as long as you have a Wi-Fi or data connection, or they’ve texted you first with SMS forwarding turned on. The only way to make and receive calls through your old number is to use your main phone number as a forwarding number. In other words, whenever someone calls your old phone number, that call will be forwarded to your main number. To set up a forwarding number, go back to Google Voice Settings and select the “Phones” tab like you did earlier on. Only this time click on “Add another phone”. Enter in a name for your forwarding number and type in the phone number below that. You can also select whether or not you want text messages to forward as well. If you want to configure even more settings, click on “Show advanced settings”. Within these settings, you can get direct access to your old number’s voicemail and even set when you want calls forwarded to you at certain times, sort of like Do Not Disturb (although Google Voice has an actual, separate Do Not Disturb feature). After you’ve customized settings, click “Save”. After that, Google Voice will call your forwarding number to verify that you own and operate it, and you’ll be prompted to enter in the two-digit number shown on the screen on your phone’s keypad. Click on “Connect” to begin that process. Once your number has been verified it will now show up under the “Phones” tab in Google Voice right below your ported number. You’ll see a new setting here: the ability to receive text notifications on your forwarding number whenever someone leaves a voicemail on your old, ported number. Check the box next to this if you want to enable it. At that point, though, your forwarding number is all set up and you’re good to go. If you ever want to make a call using your old phone number, you can do so from within the Google Voice app on your smartphone (if you have a data connection), or by calling your own Google Voice number to make a call. Title image from Google JOIN THE DISCUSSION (7 REPLIES) October 12, 2016 Joe Phillips Question - Can I port my old landline phone to google voice? I like my landline number, but it is rarely used anymore. And nobody has or uses my existing GV number, so I don't care about that changing. October 13, 2016 Craig Lloyd It's possible, but it's a pain in the butt. You first have to port your landline to a burner cellphone by calling the carrier, and then port that into Google Voice, since you can only technically port mobile phone numbers to GV. October 13, 2016 Wmk Callmore Thanks to Joe for asking the same basic question i was going to ask. My old landline number is with a voip carrier. Long ago i abandonded traditional HW LL service. I have never used google voice, but now with the kids gone we are considering the move to cell only(in about 10 mos because we are paid up until 9/2017)). Since we both have our individual cell numbers and still have living relatives who only have landlines(and others who only have our old number), we want to keep the old landline number. Can this be set up to forward the calls to both of us? Until I read this, i thought our only alternative was to get another cell line and port the number to that. What are our other alternatives? October 27, 2016 Thanks to CraigLloyd for mentioning a hidden hazard to the process of porting. Users with land lines cannot port their numbers without a significant porting fee if they are moving from AT&T or another company. The free porting provision applies to mobile customers, only, and has a history. The fiercely expensive (but still not that competitive) mobile sector is constantly in process of changing customer accounts as customers move to a better deal. This customer movement once was penalized by the mobile carriers in an effort to keep their contract customers, with painfully expensive porting fees. Consumers who found better deals were forced to pay, and mobile carriers became fabulously wealthy. At some point, consumers finally had had enough, and now the FCC makes sure mobile carriers allow consumers to keep their numbers (without porting fee) as they move to a new mobile carrier. Consumer mobile phone numbers, now printed on business cards, resumes, and in address books, have become semi-permanent property of the consumer, regardless of mobile carrier affiliation. That same porting of consumer mobile numbers is not without delay, however, and the porting process can be unreliable, at best. Numbers, if lost, are probably unrecoverable. Google, itself, mistranslated my customer address when retrieving my number from a mobile carrier, which mistranslation aborted the process time after time. So, I was left lost-in-space until by accident, a kindly operator noticed Google had translated my customer street address from "St." to "Street", which in computerese is a completely different word. Facing that idiosyncrasy from Google, I decided I could not predict my arrival date at Google Voice with any confidence. Since I also could not afford to do without my phone number any longer, I simply abandoned the effort at porting to Google. There is also another concern with Google. The Google enterprise is sometimes an inventor of very good things, but all too often, Google is an awkward, inconsistent and completely unpredictable creature of many heads. Google's record of killing off its ventures does not reassure us Google Voice will remain a reliable mooring for our permanent personal phone numbers. So, caveat emptor-- you may find the process of porting trouble free. On the other hand, Dr. Murphy and his law have been around much longer than Google. Got Feedback?

This customer movement once was penalized by the mobile carriers in an effort to keep their contract customers, with painfully expensive porting fees. Consumers who found better deals were forced to pay, and mobile carriers became fabulously wealthy. At some point, consumers finally had had enough, and now the FCC makes sure mobile carriers allow consumers to keep their numbers (without porting fee) as they move to a new mobile carrier. Consumer mobile phone numbers, now printed on business cards, resumes, and in address books, have become semi-permanent property of the consumer, regardless of mobile carrier affiliation. That same porting of consumer mobile numbers is not without delay, however, and the porting process can be unreliable, at best. Numbers, if lost, are probably unrecoverable. Google, itself, mistranslated my customer address when retrieving my number from a mobile carrier, which mistranslation aborted the process time after time. So, I was left lost-in-space until by accident, a kindly operator noticed Google had translated my customer street address from "St." to "Street", which in computerese is a completely different word. Facing that idiosyncrasy from Google, I decided I could not predict my arrival date at Google Voice with any confidence. Since I also could not afford to do without my phone number any longer, I simply abandoned the effort at porting to Google. There is also another concern with Google. The Google enterprise is sometimes an inventor of very good things, but all too often, Google is an awkward, inconsistent and completely unpredictable creature of many heads. Google's record of killing off its ventures does not reassure us Google Voice will remain a reliable mooring for our permanent personal phone numbers. So, caveat emptor-- you may find the process of porting trouble free. On the other hand, Dr. Murphy and his law have been around much longer than Google. DID YOU KNOW? The first commercial modem, the Bell 101, had a transmission rate of only 0.010 kB/s (roughly two million times slower than a modern broadband connection).

That will come as welcome news for Nexus owners, with the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P joining the Pixel C as the first devices to get access to the beta. The aim of the beta is to enable developers to prepare their apps for the new features that Android 7.1 will offer. It's only an incremental update to Android 7.0 Nougat, but does have a few additional changes, like support for Daydream VR and the new app shortcut feature, which will give you more options from an app icon, a little like Apple's 3D Touch options. Google has confirmed that other Nexus devices will get access to the beta in the future, so we'd expect the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 to follow on, probably in November.  The beta programme might make your device unstable or give you some elements that don't quite work properly and if you don't want to take that risk, don't worry: there's good news.  Google has also said that the final release of Android 7.1.x is due in early December, when it will roll out to all devices - the new Pixel and Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and Nexus 9 as well as some Android One devices. For many, the big thing will be support for Daydream VR, meaning you'll be able to take advantage of the Daydream View headset which launches in November.  Remember that you won't be getting all the features that were announced on the Pixel phones - like Google Assistant - because some of these are staying as Pixel exclusives, including the Pixel Launcher.  For now, Google has said that if you device is enrolled in the beta programme then you're all set to get the Android 7.1 update.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Pinterest There's (a lot) more than meets the eye. Imagine this: The urge to take a trip hits you while you're sitting on the couch. Maybe the TV inspired you. Maybe it was Instagram. Maybe it was that frenemy who only ever pings you from this month's Coolest Place on Earth—pithy little postcard-like dollops in which he claims he "was just thinking about you, bro, wondering what you're up to," accompanied by a photo of himself, drink in hand, on a beach in Bali. Yeah, that guy. Anyway, whatever the reason, now you want to go. But instead of doing what you do today—pulling out your laptop and vanishing down a troll hole of Yelp commentary—you just say, out loud, into the air of your presumably empty apartment, "I want to go to Bali." And a voice that's almost librarian-like, familiar but not intimate, friendly but professional, says back to you, "Okay. When?" Twenty minutes and a few exchanges later, you've reviewed your flight options, picked out an Airbnb, booked a seafood dinner for your second night on the island, and added the whole trip to your calendar without lifting a finger. The flight's on an airline with which you have status; the Airbnb has Wi-Fi because that's always non-negotiable for you; and the restaurant's gin game is strong. And it's all already on your phone, right beside a list of recommended sights built around your bookings in place and time. Welcome to the future of travel by Google. Last week, the notoriously shy search giant held one of its biggest press events ever. It was billed as a hardware announcement, and there was plenty of hardware: two new phones, VR goggles, an always-on speaker-receiver combo to compete with Amazon's Echo, a new Wi-Fi routing system, and a new version of their Chromecast streaming service that supports 4K video. But the real star wasn't physical at all—and it wasn't software, either. It was something more abstract, more pervasive, and far more powerful. Even Google struggles to name this thing; so for the moment, let’s call it the Googleverse. And whether you’re aware or not, it's already got you in a great big hug. The Googleverse is built, in part, on what Google knows about the world, which is a whole lot. Google Maps, for instance, sits atop the largest database of places ever compiled; and because Google's constantly crawling the web to discover new data it can use to answer search queries, that database is also the most up-to-date. It's coupled with richly detailed satellite imagery, not to mention street-view photos. That adds up to virtually everything written about every place on Earth, plus what every place on Earth looks like. And those two representations are linked in ways that allows Google to infer far more. This makes you—or rather, your data—Google’s final frontier. Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via PinterestSHARE THIS QUOTE Quietly, in service of its core search mission, Google has been developing deep and sophisticated language processing systems. It's how they can identify the subject and context for a given block of text on the web, and how they can match that subject-context combination to the language of your query. More recently, they've developed similarly intelligent processes for images, with deepening levels of sophistication. Is that a photo of sky, or of land? Lake or ocean? Window or mirror? Me or my brother? The blending of these two forms of intelligence supercharges them. It's not just a chair, it's a brown chair; and it's not just a brown chair, it's a vintage rattan chair; and, eventually, it's not just a vintage rattan chair, it's a 1950s vintage rattan chair sitting in the mezzanine of the Ace Hotel in Los Angeles, which has king suites available this weekend; and which is a 20-minute walk from The Broad Museum, which happens to be open till 9:00 on Fridays, and a five-minute Uber ride from that restaurant you've been meaning to try, which has a table for two open at 9:15. You get the idea. The other pillar of the Googleverse is, well, you. Every traveler's a snowflake—each has different interests and priorities when traveling, and varying price thresholds for each component of a trip. So while Google's got the world around you mapped and decoded, 98 percent of that world is of no relevance to you. It's too much data. In order to be useful, it has to be filtered. And the best filter is your uniqueness as a traveler—not just where you want to go and when, but whether you like big hotels or boutiques, mid-century modern or deco, small plates and whiskey, or steak dinners with red wine. This makes you—or rather, your data—Google’s final frontier. They already have data on everything else, right? And to cross the frontier, they need to give you ever more chances and reasons to use Google services. Which is where the hardware comes in. The anchors of last week's release were the Pixel phones—the first ever to bear Google's own brand—and the speaker-responder device they're calling Home. The first is with you everywhere you go. The second's with you whenever you're not on the go. Together, they make Google a constant presence in your life. Each may be a fine example of the thing it's meant to be—smartphone in the Pixel's case, remote speaker in Home's; but what makes them special, to both Google and you, is the intelligence—the Googleverse—that's pipelined into each. Google refers to it, in both places, as the Google Assistant, but you can think of it as a voice- (or text-) based gateway to everything Google knows about the world, crossed with everything Google knows about you, multiplied by everything Google can do with all that knowledge: compare airfares with Google Flights, book a room with Google Hotels, plot itineraries with Google Trips. Google figures—rightly—that the more you use these services, the better they'll understand you as a traveler, which in turn will let them improve the filter they apply to every interaction, and make you, in the end, a happier traveler. That, in turn, brings you back to the Google Assistant for your next trip; and so on. Google Trips Is Here With Your Next Vacation Users of Google Now have had glimpses of how powerful this can be. Right-swiping on the home screen of any pure Android phone has, since Lollipop (Android 5.0), delivered you an aggregation of damn near everything about your life: calendar, upcoming trips with flight status and boarding passes, transit alerts (“leave now to get to your 10:00 staff meeting”), package tracking, weather, sports scores, directions to places you’ve recently visited, nearby attractions, and stories from your favorite sources. It’s been a demonstration of what Google can do by blending its knowledge graph of the world with its knowledge graph of a user. For the user, it's magical—unlike the complicated, sluggish, user-configured widgets you can add to your iPhone's lock screen, you don't have to ask for most of what's in Google Now, and you'd probably never have thought to. The reminders just show up, the boarding passes appear, and they're instantly, undeniably helpful. It's the definition of technological serendipity, and it's easy to develop a dependence on them. With the Pixel and Home, Google hopes to take that experience off the slide-over screen and put it everywhere. Can they do it? Consider how closely this mission mirrors that of search itself: pull all the data from all the world, then determine what among them exactly answer the user's needs, expressed and implied, at the moment of query. Almost every major tech company, from Microsoft to Amazon to Apple, made big promises on artificial intelligence this year. In that context, Google's announcement—tonally the most modest and nerdiest of the bunch, utterly lacking in Apple's panache or Amazon's bombast—had a mic-drop quality to it. They've been building these muscles for nearly two decades, slowly, surely, product by product, an accretion of features that often seemed whimsical, indulgent, perplexing. As of last week, we can see the connective tissue—the what as well as the why. What's standing in their way? Hardware, of course. People have to use it. Which means people have to buy it. And as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon can testify, that's a long, winding, and narrow path, with more than a few scary drops along its shoulders. Google's first steps look strong, but it's all about what comes next. We'll be on the couch, waiting to see.

Google signs up writers from Pixar and The Onion to give its AI helper a personality - and a sense of humour Google added its virtual assistant to the Pixel phones and Google Home Firm reveals they have hired comedy writers to develop its personality Writers from Pixar and The Onion are now working on its language Google wants users to be emotionally connected to Assistant  By Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.com Published: 17:11 EST, 11 October 2016 | Updated: 17:46 EST, 11 October 2016 e-mail 1 View comments Google has hired comedy writers from Pixar and The Onion in a bid to make its smart assistant more likeable. It hopes to use their talent to 'infuse personality' into its AI helper, which will be used in the firm's new Pixel phones, Duo app and Home speaker. The ultimate goal is to make users feel more emotionally connected to their personal software agent and the firm believes a livelier disposition could make this happen. Scroll down for videos  In a world of order-taking machines, Google Assistant aims to be a comedian. The search giant has recently hired comedy writers from Pixar and The Onion, a satire newspaper, in order to ‘infuse personality’ into its virtual assistant that will live in Google Home (pictured)  Earlier this month, Google unveiled its Pixel smartphones and eagerly awaited Home speaker that will both be designed with the smart assistant. Gummi Hafsteinsson, product-management director of Google Home, told The Wall Street Journal’s Christopher Mins in a recent article that the writers from both organizations are already making Assistant more personable. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Amazon to battle the bodega: Shopping giant to open... Share this article Share Although this may change the AI game, actually implementing it into a device is much harder. Inventors need to put pay more attention to details such as latency, as humans do not have the time to deal with that while conversing, according to The Wall Street Journal.   GOOGLE TAKES ON AMAZON'S ECHO WITH HOME SPEAKER The 'Home' device will feature Google's digital 'Assistant' service, a voice-activated personal butler that can search the internet, play music or perform other useful tasks.  Users will be able to simply talk to the speaker, telling it what to do or asking it questions in normal English.  The device, called 'Home', is an internet-connected speaker, similar to Amazon's Echo, and was first unveiled in May The gadget is also a high quality speaker, Google claimed at the unveiling in May, allowing users to play back music from online services of a phone. It can also control other speakers, forming a voice controlled multi room hifi system, and control other devices such as lights and Google's Nest thermostat. 'Assistant' is the company's answer to similar concierge services from rivals, including Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana.  Google's ultimate goal of hiring the writers is to make users feel more emotionally connected to their personal software agent and the firm believes a livelier disposition could make this happen. The speaker will come in six different colors and be out November 4th At the unveiling of Home in May, Google boss Sundar Pichai said:  'We think of the assistant as an ambient experience that goes across devices - this is more than just phones, it will be on devices they wear, in their car and in their living rooms.' The leading tech companies are all competing to assist consumers in their online activities such as shopping, since that gives the companies a better chance of selling advertising or other services. Home-based systems like the Echo are taking on more importance with the advent of improved voice technology, according to Julie Ask, an analyst at Forrester Research. The internet-connected personal-assistant for the Home, was first unveiled by Mario Quieroz, vice president of Google, at an event in May Hafsteinsson say that Google wants its users to feel emotionally connect to Assistant, but the technology ‘is still a ways off’. All the virtual assistants on the Market, such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa, have some sort of personality to engage with their users. They can tell jokes and even do entertaining tricks – just recently Siri showed iOS users how she can beatbox. But aside from the minor chuckles, none of these assistants really have a grasp on how to have a natural conversation. They communicate with users through scripted responses, and when they can’t find an answer to a questions the response is usually ‘I don’t know’ or ‘I’m not sure’. Goggle's virtual assistant harness the power of Google's search engine along with the AI technology the firm developed to beat a grandmaster at the ancient board game Go to create assistants people can talk and text with as if they were a human being.  And now, the firm hopes by adding to humor to the mix, its personal assistant will be a game changer for its new technologies.  At a special event in San Francisco earlier this month the firm unveiled a raft of new products, included the Pixel phones and Home - but most of them were leaked online prior to the event. GOOGLE PIXEL SPECS  The Pixel runs on a Snapdragon 821 2.15GHz processor. The handsets come in 32GB or 128GB models, with microSD card slots enabling an additional 256GB of storage. Most assistants communicate with users through scripted responses, but Google hopes by adding humor it will speak more naturally. Google unveiled its Pixel smartphones (pictured) earlier this month that will all be equip with a built-in smart assistant They have 12.3 and 8-megapixel cameras and a full HD AMOLED screen with Gorilla Glass protection. Fast charging gives 7 hours of use in 15 minutes  Included is Google's AI assistant, Allo for messaging and Duo for video calls. Free online storage for pictures and video  Will be available in US on Verizon and in an unlocked version from $649.  The Home speaker, first shown off earlier this year, will be available in November and will cost $129, the first revealed. It will compete with Amazon's Echo and double as a music speaker and personal assistant, as well as being able to control a TV and hifi. They include two new phones, a Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL.  Gummi Hafsteinsson, product-management director of Google Home, who told The Wall Street Journal ’s Christopher Mins in a recent article that the writers from both organizations are already making Assistant, which will be featured in Pixel (pictured), more personable Both phones will be available in 32 GB ($649 for the Pixel, $769 for the XL) and 128 GB ($749 for the Pixel, $869 for the XL). In November, the devices will be available in Canada, the UK, Germany, Australia, and India. Although very different, Google said the new products had one thing in common - AI. 'We're at a seminal moment in computing,' said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google. 'We are evolving from a mobile first to an AI first world. HOW DO WE REALLY FEEL ABOUT VOICE ASSISTANTS?   Creative Strategies, a service that tracks trends and develops deeper insight into key industry topics, released their findings that looked at how consumers are using these virtual assistants and how they really feel about them. The firm ran two studies: Once looked at Alexa that covered 1,300 early adopters across the US and the UK. And the other focused on 500 mainstream consumers and their use of smartphones based digital assistants. Creative Strategies revealed that 21% of its panel never used Siri, 43% never touched OK Google and 72% have never asked Cortana anything. They also found that 2% of iPhone owners have never used Siri and only 4% of Android owners have never used OK Google, which suggests those who own the phone do indeed call on the powers of the digital personas. Approximately 395 of consumers use their voice assistant in their home, 51 percent in the car, but only 1.3 percent at work and 6 percent in public. Creative Strategies explains that the reason most usage is in the car is due to the hands-free law that regulates driving and texting. Those who have never used a voice assistant reported feeling uncomfortable with talking to their technology – particularly in public. 'Computing will be everywhere, people will be able to interact seamlessly, and above all it will be intelligent.' Pichai said a smart assistant was key to Google's plans. 'Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user.' Pichai said its image recognition system was now 93.9% accurate.    Read more: Your Next Friend Could Be a Robot - WSJ Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive.. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Google is well aware of this, and today’s purchase is but another step towards strengthening those bonds even further… In a blog post issued earlier today, the digital marketing agency FameBit announced that it has been acquired by Google. There are no details on the actual deal, as they haven’t been disclosed, but what we do know is that for the time being the company will remain relatively independent and keep operating from its Santa Monica HQs in California. Despite being a relatively new startup, in its three years of existence FameBit managed to do quite well, with stats that clearly caught Google’s eye. Over the past 36 months, the agency helped advertisers and creators on over 25,000 branded videos, generating no less than a whopping 2 billion minutes worth of watch time. What changes now is that FameBit’s network will be able to largely expand within YouTube, Google’s video-related platform, which now has well over a billion users worldwide. In their words: We’re excited to continue helping brands and creators succeed in an even bigger way. With Google’s relationship with brands large and small, and YouTube’s partnership with creators around the globe, we hope to connect even more brands to creators, engage more audiences, and make brand marketing more creative and authentic than ever. However, YouTube wanted to make it clear that the FameBit acquisition will grant them any preference over other competing agencies and services. “Creators will always have the choice in how they work with brands, and there are many great companies who provide this service today. This acquisition doesn’t change that,” YouTube VP of product management Ariel Bardin said in a blog post announcing the deal. “We look forward to seeing FameBit and the entire branded content space thrive as we continue to support the success and creativity of the creator community.” Guides YouTube View THe Guide Google View THe Guide FameBit View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Google's Project Fi now has family plans Engadget 11/10/2016 Nathan Ingraham © Provided by Engadget If you don't use a ton of data, Google's Project Fi (a cell phone service that jumps between Sprint, T-Mobile and US Cellular, depending on signal strength) is one of the better deals in wireless. Now, Google's making it a bit easier and cheaper to use if you have a family: the company is rolling out group plans starting today. If you're a Project Fi user, you can add up to six total people to your plan. Each additional user costs $15 per month for unlimited talk and text, down from the $20 Project Fi charges when starting up service on your own. Data stays at the same $10 per GB rate that Fi has always offered.  As before, you only get charged for what you use: if you have 10GB of data on your plan, that'll add $100 a month to your bill in addition to the charges for each line. But if you only use 8GB, you'll get $20 back on your next bill. And if you go over by 500MB, Google adds $5 to your bill. Project Fi's group plans include safeguards to keep your data usage under control, also. You can set different alerts and caps for your group members -- so if you only want your kids using 2GB of data a month, it'll shut them down after that point, for example. It's hard to compare Project Fi's costs to other carriers because no one else really offers a plan like this, but things could get expensive quick if you use a lot of data. But no other carrier offers you money back for unused data, and there's a lot to like about Project Fi beyond that -- there's no contract, and group members can be added or dropped at any time. That same reasonable data rate applies in dozens of international locations. If you've ever tried to take a phone abroad using Verizon or AT&T, Fi can be a godsend. Perhaps the biggest drawback to Project Fi is that it only works with three phones: the brand-new Pixel series, the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P. To make starting out with Fi a little less expensive, Google is offering discounts on the 5X and 6P: the 6P now starts at $399. The Nexus 5X still costs $199, the same price Project Fi has offered it at for a while now. And it's about time Google slash the price on the 6P, given that it's a year old now with a shiny new successor out in the field. If you're a Project Fi user and want to add members to your group plan, the feature is live today. You can add users by visiting your Project Fi account page online.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Android 7.1 coming to Nexuses in December, will support Nexus 6 and newer Nexuses will need to wait for the update, but not for too long. by Andrew Cunningham - Oct 11, 2016 8:21 pm UTC Login to bookmark 76 Shortly after announcing the Google Pixel phones and Android 7.1, Google said that Nexus phones wouldn't get the update until later this year (and that they wouldn't receive all of the features that the Pixel phones are shipping with). Today, a blog post from Android engineering VP Dave Burke gives a more concrete timeline: the first developer beta for Android 7.1 will hit the Nexus 5X and 6P and the Pixel C "later this month," and a final release will be available for supported Google devices in December. Google's support list says that the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 are no longer guaranteed version updates after October of 2016, but it looks like they'll be getting the 7.1 update after all. Later betas and the final release will run on anything that can run Android 7.0, a list that includes the Nexus 6, 5X, 6P, 9, and Player, as well as the Pixel C "and supported Android One devices." Android 7.1 on these Nexus devices and the Pixel C will be missing the new Pixel launcher, the Google Assistant, and a handful of other cosmetic and functional changes. But owners of Nexus devices will still get access to a decent list of new features and APIs, including a f.lux-esque Night Light mode, touch and display performance improvements, new storage manager, and more. Stay tuned for a full look at the newest version of Nougat on both Pixel and Nexus devices when the final versions are out. Users who would like to download beta OTA updates can enroll their devices here. Google will presumably also make images available for manual flashing as it did during Android 7.0's development cycle.

The first ‘incremental’ update for Android Nougat will arrive as a developer preview for Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P smartphones and Pixel C tablet users. A full consumer release is expected in December. Related: Google Pixel vs Pixel XL - Is bigger really better So, what’s within the update? Google says it’ll bring support for Daydream VR, although none of the devices listed above are officially Daydream-ready. Bummer. So is there anything to really look forward to? Well, the release will bring support for circular icons as seen on the new Pixel phones. The App Shortcuts API, which delivers Google’s version of 3D touch is also coming to Android 7.1 There’s also “Image Keyboard Support,” which will make it easier to post stickers and GIFs, et al. Storage manager intent will also allow Android phone owners to free up storage space on their devices by clicking a menu option within apps. That'll take them straight a settings page enabling them to clear unused files. Anyone can sign up for the Android Beta program. You can enroll here. The new Pixel phones will be the first to launch with Android 7.1 out of the box. Head-to-head: Are the Google Pixel phones overpriced?

Chrome is feature-rich, fast and extremely versatile thanks to a terrific ecosystem of third-party extensions. Other browsers from Microsoft's Edge to Mozilla's Firefox have been gaining in certain areas recently, but no other software offers the all-around experience Chrome affords. Of course, nothing is perfect and that goes for Google's web browser, too. As anyone who uses Chrome knows, it can be a huge memory hog, especially for users who leave multiple tabs open all the time. There's good news to be had, though: An update is coming that should have a dramatic impact on resource consumption. DON'T MISS: The end of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 saga is really only the beginning As covered in a recent post on the V8 JavaScript Engine blog, there are some big improvements coming to Chrome 55 that will have a major impact on RAM consumption. "Memory consumption is an important dimension in the JavaScript virtual machine performance trade-off space," Michael Hablich wrote in his post. "Over the last few months the V8 team analyzed and significantly reduced the memory footprint of several websites that were identified as representative of modern web development patterns." An upcoming Google Chrome update that utilizes the new engine is already in testing, and it has been found to reduce memory consumption by as much as 35% to 50% or even more, in some cases. The following graph shows RAM consumption across a variety of websites in Chrome 53, the current public version, as compared to the new version currently being tested. Google is expected to release its Chrome 55 update in early December.

Google has announced the developer preview of Android 7.1 is launching later this month, October 2016. The company says it’s first rolling out to Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Pixel C devices, and will extend the new version to other supported devices by the end of the preview. Meanwhile, the Pixel and Pixel XL, which are launching on October 20th, will be the first devices to run an early iteration of 7.1 out of the box. The devices will also include some exclusive software features — including Google Assistant and the Pixel launcher — that may never reach stock Android. The update, stresses Google, is incremental, but includes some noteworthy additions. Among them are Daydream VR support, a colour-adjusting feature called Night Light and app shortcuts, which will let developers create shortcuts that will take users straight to a specific action within their app. Another feature of 7.1, image keyboard support, lets users input images and other content directly from the keyboard. The blog post announcing the beta also states that the platform includes new APIs to support multi-endpoint calling and new telephony configuration options for carriers and calling apps. The final release of the Android 7.1.x platform is due in December 2016, and will see updates rolled out to a full lineup of supported devices: Nexus 6, 5X, 6P, 9, Player, Pixel C, and supported Android One devices, as well as Pixel and Pixel XL devices. For those brave enough to test out what could potentially be a buggy beta, the Android Beta Program can be enrolled in here. If you are already enrolled in the Android Beta Program, your device will automatically receive the update. Related: Latest version of Android Pay suggests the platform could soon come to Canada SourceGoogle thereasoner Yeah, according to an article I read on Android Plice only a few things in 7.1 actually are going to other phones. They break it down in detail , the Pixel is keeping much of the upgrades and features exclusive. AJ I think its now becoming more and more clear why they changed the name from Nexus, it seems they have (almost) completely steered away from the Nexus ideology. What initially started with good hardware at affordable prices and to promote vanilla os, has now become a premium segment and with this new exclusive features now there’s fragmentization within Google’s own line.

It takes all the knowledge of Google and adds some powerful artificial intelligence. Users can tap into this great resource by simply talking to Google as if they were talking to a real person. Google Assistant will really shine when Google Home finally launches later this year. It will also be showcased on the Pixel and Pixel XL. The good news is you can get a taste of Assistant right now in the Allo app. Right now, Assistant is still in “Preview Edition.” It’s basically Google Now results displayed in a more human-like conversation view. This simple change makes a lot more sense for Google. For a while now, Google has been smart enough to know what you’re asking about even if you don’t repeat details. You can say “how old is Harrison Ford” and then follow up with “when is his birthday?” Google knows the second question is still about Ford. Doing this in a conversational format feels very natural. Here are some examples of commands that should be familiar to you. They still work in Google Assistant. How old is… How far is it to… Play music Ask for a recipe Show me news about… Set a reminder Show me nearby… Show me photos of… Sports scores What am I doing tomorrow What movies are showing What’s the square root of What’s the weather in… Pretty standard stuff. Assistant can currently do a few things that you can’t do in Google Now and it will only get smarter over time. Here are a few new things you can try out right now in Allo. Remembers stuff for you One of the handy new features is the ability to remember information for you. A simple example is to say “my favorite color is blue.” You can then ask “what is my favorite color?” and Assistant will tell you it’s blue. A more useful real-world example is passwords and lock combinations. You could have Assistant remember the combination for your bike lock. Subscriptions for weather, news, and more Another nifty feature is daily subscriptions for things like weather and news. If you ask “what is the temperature?” you’ll notice one of the suggestions is “send me daily.” This allows you to get weather reports at a specific time every day from Assistant. The same thing works for news. Ask for news about any subject and you’ll see the same option for “send me daily.” You can also get daily poems. “Let’s play a game” Assistant has some fun stuff built-in as well. If you’re bored, you can ask to play a game. You can choose from Chat games, Quiz games, Doodle games, and Classic games.The Chat games are mostly emoji puzzles. Quiz games are pretty self-explanatory. Doodle games are the games that have been featured as the Google Doodle of the day. Classic games include solitaire and tic-tac-toe. They can all be played inside of Allo. “Recite a poem” Need some inspiration? Assistant can recite poems whenever you need one. Just say “tell me a poem” and a poem will be posted in the chat. We don’t know how often people will use this feature, but it’s kinda cool. You can also get a poem sent to you every day. Integration with more apps Something that you won’t find in Assistant right now is the ability to communicate with other devices in your home. This is something that will be very important when Google Home is available. You’ll be able to say “play a soup recipe on the TV” and Assistant will automatically play a YouTube video on your Chromecast. it will also work with home automation gadgets like light bulbs and switches. The Future is Bright The preview of Google Assistant is very promising. Google has built upon the existing functionality and presented it in a more human interface. When Assistant works well, it feels like you’re living in the future. When it doesn’t work so well, it feels like we still have a long way to go. We won’t be able to see the full potential until the Pixel phones and Google Home launch later this year. How do you feel about Google Assistant? Is this something you plan on using a lot?

Finance Search Mon, Nov 14, 2016, 2:12 PM AEDT - Australia Markets close in 1 hr 48 mins Samsung stumble opens opportunity for rivalsBy Erwan Lucas, avec Roland Jackson à Londres | AFP – Tue, Oct 11, 2016 8:55 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo While it is too early to predict the disappearance of Samsung from the phone market, rivals such as Apple, Google and Huawei are nipping at the heels of the market leader Smartphone customers losing faith in Samsung have plenty of choice at a time when Apple, Google and China's Huawei are each pushing new models that up the features ante and do not self-combust. "All of Samsung's competitors are rubbing their hands in glee," said Thomas Husson, an analyst with the Forrester technology research and consultancy firm. "It's basically a good product, released at the right time, but a slip-up, and we've seen in the past with Nokia or Blackberry that these can have disastrous effects," he added. While it is too early to predict a similar disappearance from the phone market of the South Korean company, rivals are nipping at the heels of the market leader. These include not only Apple and Chinese companies like Huawei, but also internet titan Google, which entered the smartphone market last week with its own device -- the Pixel. "There will inevitably be some moderate-to-marginal benefit for Samsung?s handset rivals, more particularly Apple, perhaps faster-growing Huawei can benefit more from Samsung?s Note 7 travails," said analyst Ken Odeluga at the online trading firm City Index. - Apple and Huawei - However Ian Fogg, senior director and head of the mobile and telecoms team at the IHS technology consultancy, said that "Huawei will be the biggest beneficiary from brand damage to Samsung." One of the largest providers of network infrastructure globally, Huawei has been pushing into the smartphone market, including the top-end segment with its P9 model that features a camera with two Leica lenses. "Huawei will look to pick up sales right across its portfolio," said Fogg, noting that Huawei was already the third-largest smartphone maker. "Like Samsung, it uses Android and offers smartphones at a wide range of prices." The blow to Samsung is unlikely to be fatal, however. "Competitors might enjoy a short-term boost to sales as a result of a major player having to withdraw its new model, though overall it is likely to remain a competitive market," said Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown brokerage. Part of the reason is that its competitors have their own challenges to surmount. Huawei, for instance, still needs to build its brand in Europe and North America. Meanwhile Apple needs to recapture the excitement around its products that has disappeared in recent years. - Tip of the iceberg? - Thomas Husson at Forrester believes "it is too early to say what the long-term impact will be" from this incident, although the recall is likely to set it back a considerable amount. Linda Sui, wireless smartphone strategies director at Strategy Analytics, estimated that Samsung could lose "$10 billion or more" over the recall. "The loss of sales from the Galaxy Note is only the tip of the iceberg," warned CMCMarkets analyst Jasper Lawler. "Demand for the flagship Galaxy S8, scheduled for release early next year, could be severely impeded by the loss of consumer confidence in the Samsung brand." But City Index's Ken Odeluga said that "nobody wants to believe Samsung has ?lost its touch? at producing beautiful and advanced consumer technology. "So there is some underlying sentiment that views its problems as the kind of bad luck which could afflict almost any smartphone maker that is pushing boundaries." But ManMohan Sodhi, a professor of operations and supply chain management at Cass Business School in London believes that it wasn't bad luck as much as bad judgement. "They should have figured out the product but with Google coming out with the Pixel, they did not give it enough time," said Sodhi. While Google has developed the Android operating system that powers the smartphones made by Samsung and other manufacturers, except for Apple, it has generally stayed on the sidelines when it comes to handsets. The release of the Pixel, along with its Google Home virtual assistant, indicates that Google aims to get its artificial intelligence technology into the hands and homes of consumers. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Woodside signs up ex-minister MacfarlaneAAP Deal-hungry energy giant Woodside Petroleum has appointed former federal resources and energy minister Ian Macfarlane … Ian Macfarlane joins Woodside boardAAP Home loans rose 0.9% in SeptAAP Underground rail to link CBD to ParramattaAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7555 +0.0014 +0.19% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.6010 +0.0021 +0.35% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6990 +0.0034 +0.49% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Robert Vaughn Toyota AU US refugee Gumtree Four Nations Perth Accommodation Trump protests Car insurance comparison Cecil the Lion Life insurance Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

That is a lot of buzzwords packed together, so lets break it down. For a while YouTube creators have been making money not just from advertising revenue generated against their video views, but by partnering with brands that want to connect with its fans. Sometimes this means making videos with a product, flying a drone or drinking a soda and reviewing it. Sometimes its more subtle, like playing a video game or eating a snack without explicitly pointing out where it came from. For many creators we spoke with, this income had become as important, if not more important, than the money they were earning through Google's advertising program. By acquiring FameBit, Google will take what had been shadow economic activity and make it part of the mainstream YouTube platform. That might make earning money through native advertising and sponsored content easier for video creators. Of course, at the same time, it helps ensure that Google / YouTube controls the value flowing to creators, and gets a piece of the action for themselves. Economic activity being dragged from the shadows Here's how Google put things in the blog post announcing the deal: "Creators will always have the choice in how they work with brands, and there are many great companies who provide this service today. This acquisition doesn’t change that. Our hope is that FameBit’s democratized marketplace will allow creators of all sizes to directly connect with brands, as well as provide a great technology solution for companies like MCNs and agencies to find matches for their creators and brand partners." Once a creator reaches a certain number of subscribers they can apply on FameBit to work with brands. The company offers up a menu of options and creators need to contact the brand and explain why they are a good fit for promoting a certain product. In the future, you could see this becoming a series of check boxes right inside the YouTube software those creators use to publish. Google may also be interested in shaping this process because the interaction between YouTubers and brands has raised some eyebrows among regulators. The Federal Trade Commission recently reached a settlement with Machinima, which works with a huge network of video creators, "prohibiting it from "misrepresenting that paid endorsers in influencer campaigns are independent reviewers." The settlement was a response to videos where YouTubers expressed positive views of the Microsoft Xbox without revealing that they had been paid to do so. The FTC has been watching closely The trend line in video advertising has been clear for a while. Ads are fine, but they work a lot better if they are integrated into the actual video and delivered by a creator that fans care about. The acquisition of FameBit makes it clear that Google sees the writing on the wall, and wants to own a piece of the pie.

Google has launched a new certification program for IT professionals interested in careers helping companies extract business value from large, diverse data sets. The Google Certified Professional Data Engineer program is targeted at people with experience in areas like programming data pipelines, tuning databases, creating reports and performing statistical analysis on corporate data. It is designed to demonstrate an individual's proficiency with key Google data technologies such as BigQuery, Cloud Dataflow and Cloud Machine Learning. In a blog post announcing the certification program, Google's head of curriculum and certification Rochana Golani described the data engineer role as key to helping companies modernize the way they use data to enable better decision-making. A Google certified data engineer would be able to help shape business outcomes by analyzing data and building statistical models to support decision-making. They will play a crucial role in helping automate and simplify business processes using machine-learning models, Golani said. "Data Engineers will build, maintain and troubleshoot data processing systems that are secure, reliable and scalable, and this certification establishes a trusted standard of proficiency for the role," she said. The new data engineer certification program is one of several that Google plans to offer under a broader Google Cloud Certification Program that the company announced recently. Google has so far announced three certification tracks under the program. The other two are a Cloud Architect certification track and a G Suite Administrator program. The cloud architect certification program will launch soon and is designed to show an IT professional's proficiency in areas like designing and planning cloud architectures, managing and provisioning cloud infrastructure, and in security and compliance. Initially, the company will offer beta certification exams for assessing an individual's proficiency in these areas. Google will gather performance statistics from these exams and use them to create the final standards for certification under the program. The G Suite Administrator certification program is designed to demonstrate an individual's proficiency at handling a wide range of tasks pertaining to Google's suite of cloud platform technologies. Individuals who sign up for the program will be trained and assessed for their readiness to handle tasks like creating, deleting and administering users and organizational units; configuring settings, policies and reporting; and ensuring the overall security of their cloud domain. Google currently offers the G Suite Administrator certification exam in English and in Japanese. According to Golani, individuals with hands-on experience using Google's Cloud Platform technologies are best prepared for the new data engineer certification program. The company has developed a certification exam guide that lists the skills required for data engineer certification. Individuals interested in signing up for the course can use the exam guide to assess their readiness for it, Golani said. "Increasingly, data drives decisions, and there's a huge demand for technical professionals who can support decision-makers," by extracting value from business data, she said. The Google certification programs appear to be a response to the surging demand for a wide range of big data skills across multiple industries. According to a Forbes report from earlier this year, just three companies—IBM, Cisco and Oracle—advertised more than 26,000 jobs requiring big data skills in the past year alone. The salaries for such professionals averaged approximately $124,000 over that period.           LATEST ENTERPRISE APPS ARTICLES   Windows 10 Sticky Notes Grow More Insightful in More Languages Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters IBM Launches Project Intu for Embodied Cognition Microsoft Releases First SharePoint Server Feature Pack Google to Shelve Free Map Maker Tool                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Node.js Is Helping Developers Get the Most Out of JavaScript Microsoft Surface Devices Challenge Apple in Enterprise Strongholds Apple's New MacBook Pros Leave Analysts Wanting More Microsoft Releases Skype for Business Mac Client Microsoft Blasts Google for Early Disclosure of Windows Bug Comparing Microsoft's Surface Studio ...

If you provide an API that returns Twitter data, you may only return IDs (including tweet IDs and user IDs). You may export or extract non-programmatic, GUI-driven Twitter Content as a PDF or spreadsheet by using “save as” or similar functionality. Exporting Twitter Content to a datastore as a service or other cloud based service, however, is not permitted. Following clarification from Twitter I making this template available again but please note. By using this template you agree it is for personal use only and the data is not made publicly available. Recently I’ve noticed a growing number of people arrive at this blog having searched for ‘export twitter followers’. Rather than them leaving disappointed here’s a Google Spreadsheet I threw together which allows you to grab a copy of your friends/followers: *** Google Spreadsheet to Export Twitter Friends and Followers – NEW Version *** Update 27/11/2014: This has been updated to a new version that uses the TwtrService Library (one time authentication) Benefits of using Google Spreadsheet Control – You register for your own API key with Twitter so you have full control of the account Playing with the data – as you are importing straight into a spreadsheet you can do all of your own data manipulation like sorting, filtering and creating your own formula for things like follow/follower ratios Backup – Google Spreadsheets allow you to download copies of spreadsheets in different formats Share – You can make your lists of friends/followers easily viewable Where’s this all going? Having already done other things with the Twitter API and Google Spreadsheets (See Populating a Twitter List via Google Spreadsheet … Automatically!, Collect/backup tweets in a Google Spreadsheet, Google Apps Script, Spreadsheets, Twitter and Gadgets) the Twitter/Google Spreadsheet back is well and truly broken. You’ll probably see fewer posts one this area with new stuff instead I’ll probably start properly documenting the little code snippets I use (but if you have any interesting ideas you want help with get in touch). This doesn’t mean I’ll be walking away from Google Spreadsheets. As recent posts like Turning Google Spreadsheets into a personal or group bookmarking service, show there is huge scope in using Spreadsheets as a very flexible rapid development platform. Below are some bits of the code used in my new spreadsheet (all the code is viewable via the Script Editor in the Spreadsheet): Update: This was the old way data was collected from the Twitter API function tw_request(method, api_request){
  // general purpose function to interact with twitter API
  // for method and api_request doc see http://dev.twitter.com/doc/
  // retuns object
  var oauthConfig = UrlFetchApp.addOAuthService("twitter");
  oauthConfig.setAccessTokenUrl(
      "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token");
  oauthConfig.setRequestTokenUrl(
      "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token");
  oauthConfig.setAuthorizationUrl(
      "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize");
  oauthConfig.setConsumerKey(getConsumerKey());
  oauthConfig.setConsumerSecret(getConsumerSecret());
  var requestData = {
        "method": method,
        "oAuthServiceName": "twitter",
        "oAuthUseToken": "always"
      };
   try {
      var result = UrlFetchApp.fetch(
          "https://api.twitter.com/1/"+api_request,
          requestData);
      var o  = Utilities.jsonParse(result.getContentText());
    } catch (e) {
      Logger.log(e);
    }
   return o;
} Using the TwtrService Library it’s replaced with: function tw_request(method, api_request){ 
  return TwtrService.get(api_request);

Used Ur link @ the top and it worked perfectly. Thanks!Reply Alli 6 years ago Permalink Thank you for this tutorial! is there anything more simple that will just count the number of followers for a list of twitter accounts? not xml export, because google docs only allows 50 of these per sheet, i need a few more than 50…. any tips very helpful thank you!Reply The Art and Science of Social Media at Dora the Explora 5 years ago Permalink Natraldi 5 years ago Permalink Hey, Thanks for that, it works perfectly. I’m only having trouble to enable the other possible column headers in Advanced Options. Could you please help me?Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Hi – it should just be a case of copying the names into a cell at the top of a blank column (unless twitter have changed the mapping) MartinReply Patricio 5 years ago Permalink Hi! I’m trying to use your spreadsheet, but it fails. I copied both keys to the configure menu. After that, I click on “test connection” aand a msgbox replies “Authorization is required to perform that action.”. Do you know what could be working wrong?Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Hi – in the spreadsheet of you go Tools > Script editor then on the dialog box that opens select Run > authorize this should valid your twitter account with the spreadsheet. You’ll then be able to run the sheet functions. Of not let me know ;) MartinReply Noah 5 years ago Permalink Hi, I am having the same issue but when I Run > authorize it tells me “Unexpected error: (line 566)” Btw it’s very generous of you to create and share tools like this, and to keep replying to poor sobs who ask you for help this far down the line! :) Thanks!Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Hi Noah – haven’t been able to conclusively trace the problem but think google occasionally makes a bad copy that doesn’t handle authentication properly. Solution is to make a fresh copy of the spreadsheet and start again. Let me know if still a problemReply Jon Thomas (@Story_Jon) 5 years ago Permalink I had the same issue (566 line error), however when I checked my OAuth Settings I noticed that I forgot to put a proper Callback URL, which should be: https://spreadsheets.google.com/macros Once I did that, saved it, and returned to the spreadsheet, I was able to select Tools > Script > Script Editor and then Run > aTest successfully. I also made sure I was signed OUT of Twitter before doing this. Hope this helps, Jon Luke 5 years ago Permalink Hi – I really like your tutorial. The twitter stuff works well. Have you had success with facebook? I am trying similar approaches but haven’t yet cracked it. Thanks LukeReply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Hi Luke – not tried or seen anything yet but it an area I think I’ll be looking at in the next 3 months. If you beat me to it interested in how you do it ;) Thanks, MartinReply charlton mcilwain 5 years ago Permalink Thanks for this! Any chance you’ve run into this error message when running the get others followers scripts? And if so, do you know of any resolution? Error message: “Exceeded absolute-time timeout in milliseconds”Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Does the other person have a lot of followers? MartinReply charlton mcilwain 5 years ago Permalink Yes, they do – 2k+.Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink hmm that’s probably what’s causing the problem. Need to see if there is a way to break the task up. Have to have a think short that one. Thanks for the feedback MartinReply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink @charlton and others – I’ve added a function to get lots of friends/followers. If you are already using the spreadsheet more information on upgrading here . The version linked to in this post has been upgraded. Let me know if there are any problems MartinReply Ryan 5 years ago Permalink Hi, when I run aTest, I got an error “TypeError: Cannot read property “statuses_count” from undefined. (line 240)”, what is this about?Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Hi Ryan – It essentially means that a connection wasn’t successful with the Twitter API (I’ve updated the script to catch this error better). In the Script editor if you run aTest then View > Log what message do you get? Thanks, MartinReply Ryan 5 years ago Permalink Thank you Martin, I have sorted out, I entered the wrong consumer key. Also, I am wondering if twitter API allows me to extract all tweets from my followers and friends?Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Hi Ryan – glad it worked out. As it happens I have another sheet for capturing peoples tweets (you can use the same API keys you’ve already got). I think the Twitter API limits the return to the last 3400 tweets. Enjoy, MartinReply Wendley 5 years ago Permalink So, I’m Brazilian and not quite understand how it works, how to have a basic tutorial to show where I make my login, that holds the account you want followers, and so on. A hug.Reply Mon 5 years ago Permalink Hi, Thanks for the apps. It surely helps a lot. One quick question though, how to add advance option in the spread sheet? Do we just add it in column header?Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Yes adding the advance column headers automatically pulls extra info MartinReply Portrait of a Twitter account: UKCLE at Danegeld 5 years ago Permalink charlton mcilwain 5 years ago Permalink Awesome! I will give it a shot. Many thanks, going to have my students make use of this in the fall. It will be a great help! One last Q – any chance there’s a way to get friends/followers of more than one person at a time?Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink @charlton hmm it might be possible the main issue is you only get 350 requests to the twitter API per hour so you will need to do some load balancing (working on another project right now, will come back to this depending on demand) martinReply Richard O 5 years ago Permalink Thanks a lot for this! Do you know if there is some easy way to turn this spreadsheet into a gdf-file or some other file that I can read into Gephi? All the best, RichardReply Tony Hirst 5 years ago Permalink @richard Gephi will accept a CSV input file. Simplest case is two columns, representing node connected to node. If you just open the CSV file in Gephi it will create the nodes and and the edges for you.Reply Richard O 5 years ago Permalink Thank you for the response, Tony! I will try that. Can I load additional information about each node from a separate file? Thank you for a very interesting blog! RichardReply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink @Richard tony has lots of gephi recipes your answer might be in http://blog.ouseful.info/tag/gephi/ MartinReply Angelo Centini 5 years ago Permalink Awesome tool! I was wondering about exporting data from twitter lists in a similar way. That would be really useful to analyze selected groups of tweeps.Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink @Angelo definitely possible (I’ve already done some work populating lists through spreadsheets ). While I take my time to get around this you might want to check out SocialBro which is able to do this. MartinReply Angelo Centini 5 years ago Permalink That’s a very interesting tool. However I haven’t been able to download the data as it says you cannot export data from external sources, and a list – also if managed by you – is intended as an external source. Nevertheless that’s a very nice desktop application, ty for sharing!Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Didn’t know about the export limitations on SocialBro – thanks for sharing. Another tool I’m just about to write about is a MS Excel add-on NodeXL (only available for Windows PC). NodeXL is an advanced network visualisation tool so probably more than you need but it does have a built-in option to get list memberships (one of the Import options) which are saved to a spreadsheet (vertices sheet) MartinReply Angelo Centini 5 years ago Permalink I’m afraid I’m a Mac user but I’ll give it a try anyway on a PC. I have to say I’m interested in visualizations too and I’ve been playing with Gephi for several months. Although I’ve a background as a statistician I’m not a coder and one of my main issues has been data export from social networking services. And your blog has revealed to be very useful. Thanks!Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink @Angelo you’ll like my latest post then on NodeXL – Getting started with the @WiredUK friends network (no coding required ;). It’s a rerun of a Gephi recipe by Tony Hirst. It might be worth firing up the PC just to get the data and then export to Gephi. It is possible to run NodeXL on a virtual machine in Mac – you’ll obviously will need a copy of Win and Office though to do this). Thanks! MartinReply Angelo Centini 5 years ago Permalink Already read it :) Thank you for your suggestions, that seems a clever workaroundReply R Wood 5 years ago Permalink Hi, I love the concept but when I run the aTest I get a pop-up on the spreadsheet that reads: “OOPS – it didn’t work” and when I check the log it reads: “Exception: Unexpected error:” Any suggestions?Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink @R Wood did you authenticate the spreadsheet with Twitter okay? MartinReply john blue 5 years ago Permalink This worked without a hiccup! Utterly amazed by the simple approach (using Google Docs) to get out info. I have been using Twitter Ruby Gem (it works too) but this was way simpler for many export tasks. Thanks a bunch.Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink @John – thanks glad it worked for you. Loads more other stuff you can do with Google Spreadsheets and Apps Script – its a great tool for rapid development ;)Reply Mark 5 years ago Permalink Great work Martin, thank you! Easy to use and runs beautifully. Been looking for something like this for awhile now. If you do develop the spreadsheet to include list data as well, just a column saying which lists you have put them in that would be fabulous. Cheers, Mark.Reply Mitch 5 years ago Permalink Thanks Martin, this is amazing. Exactly what I needed. Great work.Reply Mitch 5 years ago Permalink Actually, I’ve suddenly got an error saying, “The coordinates or dimensions of the range are invalid. (line 204)” yet I haven’t changed anything in the script. Nothing works. Any ideas?Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink @Mitch sometimes this error is a temporary fault because Google servers are playing up. One thing you could try is open the Tools > script editor run one of the menu options then check View > log to see if it says anything Thanks, MartinReply John L 5 years ago Permalink Thanks for this. However, when trying to authorize the spreadsheet with twitter, I did what you said Script Editor -> Run -> aTest (there was no ‘authorization’ function). I get the message saying ‘Apps Script – Oops. It did not work’. I’ve followed all the other steps and am not sure what is going wrong. I am running in Firefox on a Mac. Thank you for your help.Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink @John L I think its due to turbulence on either Google or Twitter servers preventing the spreadsheet to connect properly. Afraid I’ve got no better solution than trying again later MartinReply John L 5 years ago Permalink I tried it again on a different day and time using Chrome instead of Firefox. Still had the some problem. Oh well. Anyway, thanks so much for replying. I really appreciate it.Reply HD 5 years ago Permalink Hi John and Martin, I just had the same problem with the ‘Apps-Script Opps’ message. I finally went to Tools -> Script Editor, Run -> Authorize and then it fixed the problem. I guess I must have missed that in the original instruction. Hope that helps for others with the same error message. HeatherReply HD 5 years ago Permalink ps this is absolutely awesome. I just downloaded 23,000 twitter followers of a company I want to analyze – amazing! Alix Rivera, 5 years ago Permalink Thanks a lot for your great job. I did everything as you explained above, and I have no error message at all. Nevertheless I can not find where is my list. I might sound stupid, but all I have is a small yellow message saying: “Running script getFollowers” I have more than 30K followers, and I guess it will take some time to show the full list, but after 2 hours, there is nothing else but the yellow message. Do you think I did something wrong? Thank you in advance for your help. Alix.Reply Alix Rivera, 5 years ago Permalink Oh, Now I got the list. This is awesome! Thank you very very much! :DReply Benoît Perrier 5 years ago Permalink Wow, this is brilliant. Thank you so much. I was desperate seeing that tweetake.com was down. Rhis replaces it perfectly.Reply Twitterbereik in Google Maps | WOID 5 years ago Permalink Clay Hoffman 5 years ago Permalink Whenever I run aTest, I get an error saying, “Oops it didn’t work” or “Opps, Authorisation is required to perform that actions” but it doesn’t give me the option to authorize it.Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Have you done the ‘open tools > script editor and run authenicate’ bit?Reply Clay Hoffman 5 years ago Permalink i don’t see authenicate, just configuration and get follows and friends types of scriptsReply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Hmm there should be two athenicate functions in there (either will work) not sure why you can see other code and not these – usually if its a bad copy none of the code is thereReply Clay Hoffman 5 years ago Permalink I just deleted and made another copy of your spreadsheet. Still not seeing any athenicate functions.Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Is it the same problem if you run aTest in the new spreadsheet as well?Reply Clay Hoffman 5 years ago Permalink Yes it is. Tzcttwitt 5 years ago Permalink Hi, The authenticate function is gone. I copied the spreadsheet a couple of times and saw same symptoms as Clay Hoffman. I reviewed the code of the script and it has no authenticate or similarly named function :-( Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Hi – I’ve put a new version of this spreadsheet up. It has improved code for getting the data from Twitter. If there are still problems let me know Martin Twitterbereik in Google Maps « WOID - Co-creation and open innovation strategy 5 years ago Permalink Clay Hoffman 5 years ago Permalink I see the authorize script now, but when I run it I keep getting “Unexpected error: (line 580) Dismiss. This is whats on line 580-585 var result = UrlFetchApp.fetch( “http://api.twitter.com/1/account/verify_credentials.json”, requestData); var o = Utilities.jsonParse(result.getContentText()); ScriptProperties.setProperty(“STORED_SCREEN_NAME”, o.screen_name); }Reply Tzcttwitt 5 years ago Permalink Me too :-)Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Sometimes I think google doesn’t copy the authorisation tokens from twitter properly which leaves you in limbo with a half authenticated script. I’m afraid the only way I’ve found to get around this is to make a fresh copy of the template. MartinReply Joel 5 years ago Permalink This script is great, and I appreciate all the work that you have done. I looked through the comments, and it looks like other people aren’t having this issue, so I’ll see if I have something set up incorrectly. But, when I run the “getLotsOfFriendAndFo”, I get an error that says “ReferenceError: “users” is not defined. (line 172)”. Line 172 says: “var chunks = chunk(users,100);”. I am using V2 of the spreadsheet. I have tried on a couple of copies of the sheet. I am also trying to pull in someone elses followers. It works when I use the “get other persons followers” from the twitter menu, but it’s been timing out because of the volume. Any help would be appreciated, although I completly understand that you don’t want to spend a ton of time troubleshooting a free script you made.Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Hi Joel – As you asked so nicely I had a look and there was a problem with the script. I’ve updated the code so if you grab a new copy of v2.1 it should work (fingers crossed – and if it doesn’t let me know ;) MartinReply Jonah Keegan 5 years ago Permalink Martin, for advanced, do I just need to add the field name to a new column in the spreadsheet? I want to add follow_request_sent to my export. Thanks!Reply Jonah Keegan 5 years ago Permalink I think I’m actually looking for following_request_sent (the timestamp for the follow request YOU sent to a friend / someone you want to follow) I think follow_request_sent is the timestamp for follow requests from YOUR followers? Does the following timestamp exist?Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Hi Jonah – you are right in that putting follow_request_sent as one of the headers means that data is populated. As you have probably discovered now this only returns true or false. The data returned by the bit of the API used in this solution unfortunately doesn’t include a following request timestamp (if this data is important to you, you might want to look at the socialbro.com app) MartinReply Johan Myrberger 5 years ago Permalink Nice stuff, works like a charm! In order to visualize the network in gephi I’d like to also include the friends/followers relation among all friend/followers for a Twitter account. (Ie not get the complete list of all their F/F, but only the interconnection between the listed ones) Is this something you have looked at?Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Hi Johan, I do have a script which constructs friend follow relationships but its very restricted in how many relationships it can manage (e.g. ignores relationships over 5000 and can only manage base networks of 300). What I’ve done in the past is use NodeXL. The import via twitter list lets you paste a list of username you want to get relationships for and generates an edge list, which can either be analysed further in NodeXL or exported to gephi) MartinReply Shailesh Tripathi 5 years ago Permalink it is no more working.Reply Almir Souza 5 years ago Permalink Hi Martin, how are you? I configured everything according to the steps and I have no error message at all, however, can not download my complete list of followers. After all set performing “getFollowers” and showed that first run in the bottom right a message 100 to 200 of 148000, but when he arrived in 4900 to 5000 of 148000 the system kept running and not download anything. I redid the process a few times and still managed to download about 26,000, but 122,000 still missing. I did something wrong? I left to do something? What do I need to get the 148,000? But without doubt the tool is fantastic!Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Hi Almir, this tool is mainly geared around a 5000 follower max. There is a supplemental script in Tools > Script editor … called getMoreFriendsAndFollowers which can get more but is limited by the google spreadsheet maximum of 400,000 cells (with the number of columns used its around 40,000 twitter account detailsReply Almir Souza 5 years ago Permalink Martin, thanks for the help. I looked in Tools -> Script Editor -> getMoreFriendsAndFollowers, but I found this script, it does not exist for me, at least by that name. For me there and getAnotherFollowers getLotsOfFriendAndFo. It is one of these two?Reply Martin Hawksey 5 years ago Permalink Sorry don’t know my own scripts ;) yes it’s getLotsOfFriendAndFoReply Almir Souza 5 years ago Permalink Hahahaha … okay! It happens.

Question for you, i’m looking to come up with a simple method (that i can set up and walk away from) to export the follower_count and statuses_count for 10 different twitter accounts, While i can get this info using “get other followers” account by account on your spreadsheet I am then faced with a tonne more info than is required (all the followers details). Not the end of the world but running this on 10 accounts, all with 3000+ followers takes quite some time. I was wondering if i achieve this by scripting in a “Get Following” option to return only the details on the 10 accounts i follow, would this be against the twitter api terms and conditions (the reason i assume a function like this is not already included). Any info on this would be much appreciated. (I realize that i could achieve what i’m looking for by having the 10 accounts follow one specific account i’d set up for only this purpose but i could see this causing me future issues due to having no real control over who is following the account.) Thanks again.Reply JB 2 years ago Permalink Hey! Thanks so much for supporting this. Is it possible instead of using the url field, it can use the expanded_url field? Right now the urls are the t.co short links that mask the url that appears on the users profile (or when the link is resolved).Reply Martin Hawksey 2 years ago Permalink It is possible but you’ll need to modify the code in Tools > Script editor.

I tried copy pasting some users but I end up with an error.Reply Martin Hawksey 2 years ago Permalink Out of the box this tool wouldn’t do it and would need extra code. If the extra code was added I don’t think it would be any quicker than NodeXL as it uses the same Twitter data points with the same restrictionsReply Cristian 2 years ago Permalink Hi, I have used your spreadsheet many times and has always worked perfectly, but now I am having problems. When I try to authenticate after entering my API credentials I get the following error message: “TypeError: Cannot call method “getRange” of null.” I have tried with three different browsers and three different Twitter apps but the problem will not go away. How can it be solved? Thanks!Reply Martin Hawksey 2 years ago Permalink Hi – there was an issue with the script. If you retry to authenticate now or should workReply Annegret Linder 2 years ago Permalink Dear Martin! First of all: Thank you so much for your work! The spreadsheet already saved me tons of time (or money). :) I do have a little problem with the advanced options. I added a column in my spreadsheet with the followers by another Twitter user and tried to reload the data, but the columns stay empty no matter what I do or how Ilong I wait. Am I missing something? I just need to get the URL to the follower’s profiles and I’m the happiest employer on the world today. :) Thank you, thank you, thank you and sunny greetings from Germany! AnneReply Martin Hawksey 2 years ago Permalink To get followers of another user you need to use the menu option … or am I missing your question?Reply Annegret Linder 2 years ago Permalink Hi Martin! I managed to get the data for another Twitter user, and I also added columns for example for verified/not verified. But it seems to be the case that the column for the link to the user profile does not work properly. The data does not load. Besides that everything is great! :) Thank you AnneReply Billay 2 years ago Permalink Martin, Wanted to be sure to Thank You for making this product. It has saved me a ton of time. I was on a mission to figure out how to get followers/following from a twitter account when I ran across your template. It would have taken me many hours to figure out how to do this. You made things so much easier. I’m not sure if I saw this mentioned somewhere in the comments or if you’re aware it does this, but before trying your getlotsofFriendsorFo script, we decided to run that same spreadsheet name again for an account that has 15k followers. To our surprise your coding remembered the twitter cursor and bought back the rest of the records in 3 batches. I’m sure using your getlotsofFriendsorFo script would be beneficial for larger accounts resulting in less batch runs, but this was Outstanding! Thanks again,Reply John 2 years ago Permalink Hi, thanks for what seems to be a great tool! I’ve tried following the steps, but when it attempts to authorize my Twitter account it says that “Having multiple Google accounts will interfere with the authorization” (paraphrased). It suggests opening an Incognito window, but when I run the script there I get the same results. I can’t get through that screen to the next step. Also, what steps are needed to completely uninstall everything once I’m done? best JohnReply Dan 2 years ago Permalink I have this same problem too. Is there a way to fix this?Reply Martin Hawksey 2 years ago Permalink What browser version are you using? Multiple google accounts aren’t an issue if you are running the script against your default account. I’ve added a menu option to disconnect twitter access. Take a fresh copy of the template to use it. As personal access details are stored centrally running this in one sheet deletes details for all (I should add the way access details are stored means as the project owner I have no access to them, they are stored by Google associated with your user account)Reply John 2 years ago Permalink Hi Martin, I am using the latest version of Google Chrome [Version 42.0.2311.90 (64-bit)]. I couldn’t get your Spreadsheet to work, as mentioned in my previous post.Reply Martin Hawksey 2 years ago Permalink ah – think I’ve spotted the problem. There were some changes Google made that I didn’t push to this version. If you take another copy of the template (sorry) it should work.Reply Keith 2 years ago Permalink I’m having the same problem with the 3.2.2 version. Did this get resolved? I’ve tried with different browers and making new copies of the google doc. It seems to hang up on that “multiple accounts” page and doesn’t move on. Bain 1 year ago Permalink Thanks for sharing this. I’m not a programmer (and don’t even play one on TV), so there is no way I could have done this myself. (Well, I suppose if I spent a few months learning to code…) You’ve saved me a ton of time. Thanks again!Reply Sam 1 year ago Permalink Hi Martin, Thank you for your tool, the instructions were very easy to follow! However, it pulled 5 times as many followers then we actually have. What could be the reason for this?Reply Austin Burbridge 1 year ago Permalink This tool has been working very well — until a few days ago. Suddenly it has started to pull many duplicate records, etc.Reply UCAudio 1 year ago Permalink Can this be tailored to export all tweets you have favorited along with the username of the person who posted the favorited tweet? Thanks!Reply Martin Hawksey 1 year ago Permalink I’ve got this alternative project for collecting search and favorites https://tags.hawksey.info/get-tags/ (the site has a support forum if you get stuck)Reply dany_danay 1 year ago Permalink Hi! Thanks a lot for your work! I have a question/problem. I want to extract lots of followers from an account, i try this: If you get a ‘Exceeded absolute-time timeout in milliseconds’ error message there is a manual function in the script editor called getLotsOfFriendAndFo(). To use this clear any existing data imported to the particular sheet and enter the following details into the function in the script editor: sheetName – sheet name you want to import the data to; friendOrFo – whether you want ‘friends’ or ‘followers’; and optScreenName – the screen name of the person To run the script Run > getLotsOfFriendAndFo as many times as needed (the script will import 100 friends/followers at a time) or if you want to go away and make a cup of tea use Triggers > Current project triggers and add getLotsOfFriendAndFo as a time-driven function to run every minute (once you’ve finished your tea best to delete this trigger). With NO results… This: sheetName – sheet name you want to import the data to; Its a new spreadsheet created in google drive or what?!?Reply Martin Hawksey 1 year ago Permalink you need to be a bit more leisurely – twitter rate limits this data. I can’t recall the actual limits (might be captured in the comments), but running every 15min should do itReply Lizzie 1 year ago Permalink Hi, I love the concept of this tool! I’m a beginner trying to follow your instructions… I get to the point of creating my twitter application and can’t go any further because the following error message appears: Error The client application failed validation: Not a valid URL format I think my issue is that I don’t fully understand what I am being asked for here, but can you help explain please so that I can create the required coded to continue? Many thanks LizzieReply Alex 1 year ago Permalink Hi, sorry if I’m missing something, but I’m trying to grab a list of another user’s followers. It works at first then times out after successfully grabbing 5000 followers. It tells me to run it again to get the rest (a further 3000 ish), but nothing happens when I do – can’t get those last 3000. Any tips? Many thanks AlexReply peconi 1 year ago Permalink hi, your script is not working anymore: trying to get other persons followers I get this error message: “Script is using OAuthConfig which has been shut down. Learn more at http://goo.gl/IwCSaV” The version I’m using is 2.1.2 ThanksReply Martin Hawksey 1 year ago Permalink You need to use the latest version of the template (v3.2) linked to from http://mashe.hawksey.info/2011/03/export-twitter-followers/Reply JS 1 year ago Permalink Thank you for the update! I also just moved up from 2.1.2. Very much appreciated.Reply mark 1 year ago Permalink im having an issue with downloading once over 5000, like mentioned i use the script editor and i manage to get on occasion around 20k on one sheet, i copy what i have into my excel sheet, clear the current sheet and reload the page, i then run script again, it says it downloads them and no errors come up and all the extra cells are there so the row goes down to about 20-30k, or more depending on how many times i run it, however not data is showing in any of the cells?Reply Alejandro 1 year ago Permalink Hi Marti, thanks for sharing this hack. I’ve tried following the steps, but when it attempts to authorize my Twitter account it says that: “Twitter Authorisation Please be aware that if you are logged into multiple Google accounts authentication may fail.

Great help and so easy to use !Reply Derek 9 months ago Permalink For anyone getting the following error: “Oops something went wrong. Twitter says: Desktop applications only support the oauth_callback value ‘oob’ /oauth/request_token” You need to edit your Twitter Application and add in a Callback URL. For the sake of simplicity, just use a localhost address: http://127.0.0.1:4000 I did this and the script worked perfectly!Reply John 7 months ago Permalink Hi. Thank you for sharing this hack, it has been very useful. Lately though I often encounter an error with big accounts (account with really many followers). The script freezes after it adds rows in the spreadsheet and throws an error: “TypeError: Cannot call method “join” of undefined” I suspect it may be due to very long user ids twitter now uses. It seems to me that there is a problem with lookup function of these ids but I am not sure where. I tried to add a line in getLotsOfFriendAndFo function “params.stringify_ids = “true”;” but this didn’t solve the issue. Using logger I can see that now user_id param is displayed correctly but the problem persists. I suspect it may be due to big accounts having many new users with long user ids. I don’t get this problem with relatively smaller accounts but still well over 5000 followers. I would very much appreciate if you could find a way to fix thisReply Andres Guerra 3 months ago Permalink The script stringifies id numbers too big to be used as arguments and those are lost. I have 124 followers. Martin’s script gives me 122. I’ve tried to get my followers through Twitter’s console https://dev.twitter.com/rest/tools/console and it gives me two more, which are the only ones that have the new, long id number. They don’t appear among the 122 the spreadsheet shows. I would appreciate that this is fixed too. I’ve been trying for hours to no avail. The problem is well explained here: https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/twitter-ids-json-and-snowflake Thanks!Reply Martin Hawksey 3 months ago Permalink I don’t think this is a problem – the sheet already uses id_str referenced in the link provided. Andres if you can provide your twitter screen name I can look into furtherReply Jason 6 months ago Permalink Is there a way to extract the email addressed from this google spreadsheet?Reply Martin Hawksey 6 months ago Permalink Twitter don’t make this information availableReply Gabrielle 6 months ago Permalink re: advanced settings – adding a column header doesnt seem to be working for me. Added Column “O” (after N) included fx profile_link.. hit getfriends again and I get errors. It adds 5 new users each time but they are 5 blank lines.

Have you managed to get it to work?Reply Martin Hawksey 4 months ago Permalink looks like Twitter have changed this – using a column name `url` will return a shortened version of a profile link. To get the expanded version required an edit to the code, but if you take a fresh copy of the template profile_link should be working againReply John 4 months ago Permalink When I try and run the ‘Get Followers’ for a second time to pull additional followers I’m receiving the ‘TypeError: Cannot call method “join” of undefined.’ Error … Any ideas??Reply Jon 2 months ago Permalink I’m getting this too :( Sara Mulder 3 months ago Permalink Thanks for this – love it!!Reply Mario 3 months ago Permalink Thank you! Life saver.Reply Vanessa 3 months ago Permalink Hi, I’ve been using this tool pretty reliably, but the last few times I’ve used it, it’s given me the incorrect number of followers. When click “get another person’s followers” and input the screenname, it collects the data and roughly shows the right number of followers. However, when it says that it’s inputting the number of followers into the sheet, it’s a lower number. So the account has 700 people, it says it’s located 700 people, but only puts in 650 into the sheet. Is there any way I can deal with this? Thanks!Reply Vanessa 3 months ago Permalink Hi there, the tool isn’t downloading the right number of followers. It identifies the correct number of followers when it’s gathering the data, but when it actually inputs it into the excel sheet, it misses quite a few. For example, the account has 700 followers. The tool identifies this but then only downloads 650. I’ve tried this with other accounts and it appears to have the same issue. Any help?Reply Joe Lamport 2 months ago Permalink I keep getting this message when I try to authorize: “Oops something went wrong. Twitter says: Desktop applications only support the oauth_callback value ‘oob’ /oauth/request_token” I’ve tried re-copying the spreadsheet, putting in a call back URL, but still it is not working.

 Google bought a company that helps brands get product placements in YouTube videos Steve Kovach Oct. 11, 2016, 3:31 PM 4,226 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google announced Tuesday that it bought Famebit, a company that helps brands work with YouTube creators for marketing their products. Famebit is basically a way for companies to get product placement in videos posted by popular YouTube users. Google did not say how much it paid for Famebit, but Famebit will continue to run independently from Google for now, according to the announcement. To give you an idea of what Famebit does, here's an example of a video one of the company's creators made to help promote an app called Best Friends: This is the third acquisition this year for the Los Angeles-based startup studio Science Inc after exits from Dollar Shave Club and Hello Society. Science owned the majority of the three-year-old startup. And here's the full announcement from Google: Nine years ago, YouTube launched its Partner Program with the goal of helping creators earn advertising revenue while connecting their innovative content to audiences around the world. Every year, more and more brands are making YouTube essential to their marketing strategy. In fact, in the last year alone, the top 100 advertisers have increased their spend on YouTube video ads by 50 percent. As brands continue to embrace the value of YouTube, they’re also taking their investments one step further, partnering with creators on branded content opportunities such as product placements, promotions and sponsorships. As we look to the future, we want even more creators and brands to come together and realize the benefits of these creative collaborations. Today, we’re excited to announce that Google has acquired FameBit -- a technology platform company that helps creators and brands find and work with each other through sponsorships and paid promotion. We believe that Google’s relationship with brands and YouTube’s partnerships with creators, combined with FameBit’s technology and expertise, will help increase the number of branded content opportunities available, bringing even more revenue into the online video community. Creators will always have the choice in how they work with brands, and there are many great companies who provide this service today. This acquisition doesn’t change that. Our hope is that FameBit’s democratized marketplace will allow creators of all sizes to directly connect with brands, as well as provide a great technology solution for companies like MCNs and agencies to find matches for their creators and brand partners. We look forward to seeing FameBit and the entire branded content space thrive as we continue to support the success and creativity of the creator community.

Written by Bhaskar Chakravorti | Updated: October 12, 2016 12:13 pm Much of the American election rhetoric has focused on the ongoing competitiveness and trade agreements with other countries, notably China, as well as those associated with the Trans Pacific Partnership. India and the US are on opposite sides of a digital divide — and it is not in the way you would expect. India is experiencing a digital deluge in its political and policy discourse whereas the US political and policy establishment is passing through a digital desert. This is odd because one always thinks of America as the centre of all things digital. Consider, first, developments in India. In addition to Digital India workshops being organised in 120 universities, covering 2,400 colleges and 30,000 students, Infosys co-founder, Kris Gopalakrishnan, recently turned in an ambitious report on how to realise the Digital India programme. Google has set a digital locomotive in motion by announcing plans to build on its initial success in creating WiFi hotspots around railway stations, in partnership with the telecom arm of Indian Railways. The World Economic Forum’s India Economic Summit focused on the theme of “fostering an inclusive India through digital transformation”. Digitalism seems at the epicentre of India’s policy narrative. Even if it is still just talk, committee reports and grand programmes, at least there is talk. Consider, first, developments in India.

Even if it is still just talk, committee reports and grand programmes, at least there is talk. By contrast, in the US, a presidential election season is in full swing. The candidates are outspoken on many issues; yet, there is a noticeable coyness about mentioning the d-word, except in a negative context. One candidate’s email habits are the subject of plenty of nasty campaigning, for which the other candidate leans heavily on a hyperactive Twitter account. Both candidates agree on the importance of tackling the threat posed by — what the second candidate refers to as — “the cyber”. Ignoring the d-word has severe consequences. Consider a few ways in which the d-word makes a profound difference in the US economy. The rise of the so-called “gig economy” is reshaping how many workers think about jobs. According to a study by Harvard’s Lawrence Katz and Princeton’s Alan Krueger, all net new jobs created in the US since 2005 are due to this phenomenon. More and more workers are contractors or freelancers and are increasingly relying on digital intermediaries to do their work. The d-word is closely tied to how jobs are being created.Even as the internet creates jobs, it makes other jobs obsolete. Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee at MIT have been arguing that advances in digital technology and its applications to automation — from improved industrial robotics to automated translation services — explain the slow employment growth of recent years, and the situation will only get worse.

If you are a bookkeeping accounting or auditing clerk, there is an 86 per cent chance of your job being automated with current technology — and there are 1.6 million such workers; as a stock clerk and order filler, there is an 85 per cent chance of your work could be automated now — and there are 1.8 million such workers; as a food preparation and serving worker, including fast food, there is a 74 per cent chance of job being automated — and there are three million such workers. Until now the jobs at risk fell into very specific lower-level categories; with artificial intelligence, big data, sensor technologies, driverless cars, advanced robotics and 3D printing, among other offshoots of digital technology, more sophisticated tasks will be next. The changes cited above are going to continue to exacerbate inequalities. The value associated with digital industries accrues to the owners of capital and the highest-skilled workers. Over the past three decades, labour’s share of output has shrunk globally from 64 per cent to 59 per cent. Access to the digital infrastructure is now a critical factor in determining access to opportunities for moving up the income ladder, productivity and access to essential services. According to The White House statistics, in 2015, one in four Americans did not have internet access at home; Hispanic, Black and Native American households trail White households in internet adoption by more than 10 per cent; overall, older, less educated, lower income, and rural households have fewer choices and slower internet connections, setting up a vicious cycle and deepening a digital disparity. Much of the American election rhetoric has focused on the ongoing competitiveness and trade agreements with other countries, notably China, as well as those associated with the Trans Pacific Partnership. It turns out that China is mounting an even more profound competitive threat on the digital front. According to the Digital Evolution Index that we developed at The Fletcher School, China is leading the world in digital momentum, while the US is ranked 30th out of the 50 countries studied. Of late, it is China, not Silicon Valley, that is taking the lead in developing mobile technologies. “Quite frankly, the trope that China copies the US hasn’t been true for years, and in mobile it’s the opposite: The US often copies China,” according to Ben Thompson, the founder of the tech research firm, Stratechery, quoted in The New York Times. As for the manufacturing advantage that often propels China to the forefront, there is a new — digitally led — frontier emerging that will continue to drive a competitiveness wedge between the US and China. While, there are still only 36 robots per 10,000 manufacturing workers in China, Beijing has set a goal of raising the robot-to-worker ratio to more than 100 by 2020. The Chinese government’s “Made in China 2025” initiative provides manufacturers with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of resources for technological upgrades, including advanced machinery and robots. This will add to a compounding of the job creation challenge in the US as Chinese manufacturing renews its global competitiveness. The World Bank proposes investing in the “analog complements” of the digital economy, including adapting skills to get the most out of the digital revolution. It has also argued that governments ought to facilitate innovation and strengthen education and skill building. It is even more essential now to invest in an education system that fosters the critical thinking, humanistic and creative skills that set them apart from automated and AI systems. Digital technologies, from computers to MOOCs to interactive games, can help reinvent public education. Why, you may ask, do American politicians run campaigns as if they are frozen in the early 20th century, and not acknowledge the post-internet realities? The answer is simple: Ohio (and other so-called political “battleground” states). Battleground states are also places that have suffered the greatest decline in jobs because of the loss of the manufacturing industries to overseas competitors. Elections are won or lost on the basis of who wins these states. These states are far from the digital ghettos of Silicon Valley or Boston.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google just confirmed that it will deploy the Android 7.1 Nougat Developer Preview to several devices later this month. Android 7.1 was first introduced in tandem with the Google Pixel. Android 7.1 will include platform Daydream VR support (this doesn’t necessarily mean it will work with the device you’re using), support for new app shortcuts, image keyboard support that will allow third-parties to embed new functions inside keyboards and more. Developers will also find support for circular app icons, enhanced wallpaper metadata and the new App shortcuts API. The update does not, however, include Google Assistant. Why this matters: Owners of Nexus devices were left in the cold when Google announced the Google Pixel with Android 7.1. Now we know that it’s coming to the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and Pixel C devices, with “other supported devices [coming] by the end of the preview.” We still think Google should have brought Google Assistant into the fold, though.

The 7.1 beta will be available first on the Nexus 6P, 5X, and Pixel C tablet. The Pixel and Pixel XL, launching on October 20th, will be the first devices to ship with Android 7.1 out of the box. The Pixel phones also get exclusive built-in features like the Google Assistant, Pixel Camera, Pixel Launcher, and 24/7 customer support, which do not appear in the core Android 7.1 release. Google has said it will continue supporting Nexus products through software updates and customer service, but the days of Nexus being first to receive the latest Android upgrades are over. Some of the new consumer-facing features that are included in Android 7.1 for non-Pixel devices are Night Light — Android’s answer to Night Shift in iOS — plus Daydream VR support and optimizations to touch and display responsiveness. Developers can also now add “app shortcuts” to their Android apps, letting users skip to certain sections or features of the software directly from their home screen. Yeah, it’s pretty close to 3D Touch minus the pressure-sensitive display. Google isn’t yet saying when Android 7.1 will be widely rolled out to Nexus hardware, but at least you won’t need to wait much longer to get in on the beta. Just sign up for the Android Beta Program to ensure you get the update when it’s ready.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed. According to Google, FameBit will continue remain a standalone operation for now, based in Santa Monica, Calif. FameBit, founded in 2013, had raised $1.5 million from investors including Science Inc., Third Wave Digital’s Allen DeBevoise, 500 Startups, DeNA and Highline, according to Crunchbase. The company says it has worked with brands including Marvel Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Sony, L’Oreal, Canon, Activision Blizzard, Adidas, Rovio and Conair. To date, FameBit has brokered deals between advertisers and creators that have resulted in more than 25,000 branded videos, which have generated over 2 billion minutes of viewing time. YouTube felt compelled to stress that the FameBit acquisition doesn’t mean it will grant preference to FameBit to over other competing digital-marketing agencies or services. “Creators will always have the choice in how they work with brands, and there are many great companies who provide this service today. This acquisition doesn’t change that,” Ariel Bardin, YouTube VP of product management, wrote in a blog announcing the deal. “Our hope is that FameBit’s democratized marketplace will allow creators of all sizes to directly connect with brands, as well as provide a great technology solution for companies like MCNs (multichannel networks) and agencies to find matches for their creators and brand partners.” FameBit founders David Kierzkowski and Agnes Kozera, in a blog about the deal, said that given the combination of Google’s relationship with brands and YouTube’s partnership with creators worldwide, “we hope to connect even more brands to creators, engage more audiences, and make brand marketing more creative and authentic than ever.” To join the FameBit marketplace, creators must have at least 5,000 followers on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook or Tumblr. FameBit’s primary investor was startup incubator Science Inc. In a blog post about the Google deal, Science CEO Michael Jones said FameBit was the first social-influencer marketing platform he had seen that had created true self-service capabilities, “reminding me of the early days of AdSense.” “It’s safe to say that influencer marketing isn’t going anywhere  —  online influencers on social platforms impact millennials and Generation Z even more than traditional celebrities do,” Jones wrote.

Project Fi and Google Voice: Your questions answered Google's weird wireless service just keeps getting better. You've heard of Project Fi by now, right? It's an experimental cell plan from Google that works with Nexus and Pixel phones. In a nutshell, it seamlessly switches your phone between a handful of networks -- Sprint, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular -- to get you the best possible signal at any given time or place. It also taps into reliable public Wi-Fi networks (with its own layer of encryption in place) and uses those for your calls and data whenever it can. You pay only for the actual mobile data you use each month -- at the same flat rate, even if you're roaming in a different country. It's an unusual arrangement that won't make sense for everyone, but if you're anything like me and my family, it could end up simplifying your life and saving you some dough. Today, the potential for savings is growing even greater. Google just announced a new Project Fi group plan that lets you put multiple phones onto a single account instead of treating them as individual entities, as the service had previously required. If you're already using Project Fi or thinking about giving it a whirl, this new option is something you should seriously consider. In fact, if you have multiple family members on Fi, you'd almost be crazy not to take advantage of it and combine your accounts immediately. Why? Above anything else, it's a matter of simple math. Let's break it down. The Fi family formula At its core, Project Fi has just one universal plan: You pay a base fee of $20/mo. plus $10 per gig of data used. With the new group plan, secondary lines have a base fee of $15/mo., along with the same standard pay-for-what-you-use data rate. So in other words, by combining your family's individual Fi accounts into a single group plan, you'll pay $5 less per month -- while still maintaining the same exact service and rates. The best part? Combining existing accounts couldn't be easier to do. You just go to your Fi account page, follow the prompts to create a group plan and add someone else onto it, and then wait for that person to accept the invitation. I did it this morning, and in a matter of seconds, my wife's individual account was gone and she was part of our new group plan instead -- no SIM card changes, no service interruptions, no hassles whatsoever. It just worked. (Fi kept my billing cycle and prorated her for this month as well as for the part of the month she'd already used on her old individual plan.) And bam: Just like that, our collective monthly cost for cell phone service got $5 cheaper. Sixty bucks a year back in our pockets for a couple minutes of work.  Not too shabby. Other Fi group plan perks On top of the savings, the Fi group plan gives you a new set of tools for managing data usage on secondary accounts. While I obviously won't be putting a cap on my wife's usage (hi, honey!), I could see this being handy in the (ahem, very distant) future -- when we might want to give our daughter a cheap smartphone and limit her to a small amount of mobile data usage per month. And, of course, you end up with a single collective bill -- complete with a breakdown of device-by-device usage and charges -- instead of having to deal with two individual statements. It's a relatively minor asterisk to this, really, but as far as I'm concerned, anything that streamlines my expenses is a positive. Oh, and there's one other significant subheadline here to note: As part of the group plan announcement, Google has confirmed it'll continue to sell the 2015 Nexus 5X and 6P phones to Project Fi subscribers. So if you don't want to shell out a cool 650 smackeroos for a shiny new Pixel phone -- be it for yourself or for a family member -- you have some more affordable options that'll fully work with Fi's service. (The 5X is currently selling for $199 while the 6P is priced at $399 -- both unlocked and free from any long-term commitments.) You'll have to crunch the numbers with your own smartphone usage patterns to see if Project Fi itself makes sense for you. If you are using the service, though -- and have other family members on board with you -- don't wait. Go switch yourself over to the new group plan this second. Your wallet will thank you.

Pocket-lint 10/11/2016 pocket-lint.com © Pocket-lint/Google/Roku The GoogleChromecast Ultra was recently announced and is set to be available to buy from November. With 4K streaming and HDR picture quality it's going to be a good alternative to the Roku Premiere+. Popular Searches Amgen Inc AMGN ▼ 149.04 -2.53 -1.67% Ampliphi Biosciences Corp APHB ▼ 0.9801 -0.1199 -10.90% Banc of California Inc BANC ▲ 13.90 +0.05 +0.36% To help you decide which one is the best choice for you, read on as we go into the differences between the Google Chromecast Ultra and Roku Premiere+. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Design With the Chromecast Ultra, Google isn't changing much in terms of design. Anyone acquainted with the Chromecast range will note the familiar shape of this circular streaming device. Unlike the Chromecast 2, the Chromecast Ultra is only available in black – lemon and coral are no longer an option. There's a gloss finish, but otherwise the Chromecast Ultra keeps the tried and tested frame. The Chromecast Ultra tucks away neatly behind your television and only the charging cable and Ethernet cable (should you choose to use one) will be visible. Meanwhile, the Roku Premiere+ makes its appearance in a sleek black unit that harks to the traditional set top box style. At 124.5 x 124.5 x 21.6mm, the Roku Premiere+ still packs a lot of smart technology in a small package, but it won't be as well hidden behind your television, nor will you necessarily want it to be. The included point anywhere remote does offer the advantage of not requiring line-of-sight placement however, unlike most of the other devices in the Roku range. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Hardware When it comes to hardware, both the Google Chromecast Ultra and Roku Premiere+ offer relatively similar specs; both will stream 4K and include HDR picture quality, which lesser streaming devices will not. The Roku Premiere+ boasts 60 fps streaming and upscaling of 720p and 1080p content to 4K on capable Ultra HD televisions. Meanwhile, the Chromecast Ultra also supports Dolby Vision which the Roku Premiere+ does not. Google says the Chromecast Ultra is 1.8 times faster than the previous models but successful streaming of 4K content will depend on the service you're getting from your ISP and whether you're using the Wi-Fi or wired connection. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Connectivity Netflix recommends 25mb/s for smooth 4K playback so you'll need a solid internet connection. You might want to consider an Ethernet connection for good quality playback without issue, especially if you suffer from Wi-Fi problems in your home. Both the Google Chromecast Ultra and Roku Premiere+ offer wired networking ports and the Chromecast Ultra includes a power adaptor Ethernet port to make this connection even easier. If you prefer Wi-Fi, the Chromecast Ultra is 802.11ac (2.4 GHz/5 GHz) capable and the Roku Premiere+ supports 802.11ac MIMO dual-band wireless. The Chromecast Ultra is powered by the familiar Micro-USB charging cable while the Roku Premiere+ has its own DC power adapter and both streaming devices connect to your television or home cinema system via standard HDMI cable. The Roku Premiere+ has the added advantage of a microSD card slot for additional channel storage. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Audio Both streaming devices are capable of delivering high-quality audio. The Google Chromecast Ultra supports surround sound output, while the Roku Premiere+ offers Dolby Audio pass-through. The Roku Premiere+ has a slight edge here with the included option of 'night listening mode' which ensures all volumes are kept level at night so there's no nasty surprises that might disturb the neighbours. Better still, the Roku Premiere+ also offers a 'private listening' option with a headphone jack built right into the remote control, so you can plug in and watch your television without any need for worrying about volume or disturbing others. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Remote control Remote control is probably the main difference with these two streaming devices and each offer their own benefits depending on how you're going to use them. The Google Chromecast Ultra is controlled via your phone or tablet using the Google Cast app available from iTunes and Google Play. The advantage the Chromecast Ultra has here is the additional ability to cast content from Chrome via a laptop or desktop machine. This gives a lot more flexibility in the type of content you can cast, as well as the method by which you do it. You can also cast content from providers like Netflix using this, meaning you can save phone battery but still access great content with ease. Meanwhile, the Roku Premiere+ is controlled using Roku's mobile app which boasts voice search capability and easy access to a wealth of content from various streaming providers. Roku also includes an advanced remote control which not only has the headphone jack we mentioned earlier, but also allows you to use it without requiring line-of-sight placement. If you're not a fan of the Roku remote, then you'll be happy to learn the that Roku Premiere+ is also compatible with a range of universal remote controls, so how you control your content is up to you. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Content Both the Google Chromecast Ultra and Roku Premiere+ offer access to a wide range of content from a variety of providers including Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Showtime and more. Roku claims you can access over 350,000 movies and TV shows while Google says they support 200,000. It is important to remember however, that the Chromecast Ultra also supports music, radio, games and a variety of different apps available via Google Play. The Roku Premiere+ has the advantage of offering Amazon Video out of the box where the Google Chromecast Ultra does not, though you can stream it using the cast functionality in Google Chrome on a laptop or desktop machine. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Price and availability The Google Chromecast Ultra is set to retail at $69/£69 when it launches in November and thus represents a great price for 4K streaming in a small but capable package. If you want a little more functionality and the addition of the robust and functional remote control, you might consider the Roku Premiere+ at the slightly higher price of $99.99. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Which should I buy? Comparing these devices side-by-side, it's easy to see that there's not much between them. If affordability is important to you, then the Chromecast Ultra is probably the sensible choice. The Roku Premiere+ will certainly be a good alternative for people who are looking for easier content access and the simple, yet effective remote control functionality however.

Google calls 7.1 an “incremental update,” one we got a brief look at as it was running on the Pixel and Pixel XL. The update brings a handful of new changes, things like app icon shortcuts, Daydream VR support, automatic background updates, and image keyboard support. Here’s the full official change log: App shortcuts API — lets you surface key actions directly in the launcher and take your users deep into your app instantly. You can create up to 5 shortcuts, either statically or dynamically. Circular app icons support — lets you provide great-looking rounded icon resources that match the look of Pixel and other launchers. Enhanced wallpaper metadata — lets you provide metadata about your wallpapers to any picker displaying the wallpapers as a preview. You can show existing metadata such as label, description, and author, as well as a new context URL and title to link to more information. New developer features: Image keyboard support — expands the types of content that users can enter from their keyboards, letting them express themselves through custom stickers, animated gifs, and more. Apps can tell the keyboard what types of content they accept, and keyboards can deliver all of the images and other content that they offer to the user. For broad compatibility, this API will also be available in the support library. Storage manager Intent — lets an app take the user directly to a new Settings screen to clear unused files and free up storage space on the device. While Google’s upcoming flagships will have 7.1 out of the box, Nexus users who join up with Google’s Android Beta Program will need to test it first. The update will begin rolling out later this month, but will only be available for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and the Pixel C. The rest of the Nexus family can expect to see it sometime near the end of the preview, with Google saying that the final version of Android 7.1.x will be available to Nexus 6, 5X, 6P, 9, Player, Pixel C, some Android One devices, as well as the Pixel and Pixel XL in December. Notably absent from the announcement was any word on Google Assistant, which appears to still be a Pixel exclusive (but there are methods to get it up and running on some Android devices right now).

Tech News | 11 Oct 2016 | Print  | Comment (0) Google Event Unveils Smartphones, Wi-Fi, VR, and Streaming Devices by Julio Ojeda-Zapata In what has become a recurring exercise, Google recently staged a product announcement just weeks after Apple’s media event revealed the iPhone 7, Apple Watch Series 2, and AirPods. As with a previous such event (see “Google I/O 2016 Includes Announcements with Apple Appeal,” 23 May 2016), much of what Google showed off has direct parallels with the Apple world. Notably, both companies showed off their next-generation smartphones. But while the Google event might seem like a me-too exercise with an undercurrent of Apple envy, it demonstrated how Google is outpacing its Cupertino competitor in some ways. Google’s new Pixel smartphones don’t blow the new iPhone 7 models out of the water, but they do have characteristics that might inspire some envy. And Google is pulling ahead of Apple in areas such as Wi-Fi and virtual reality. None of Google’s improvements are so significant that Apple users will be enticed to switch, but the competition should keep Apple on its toes. iPhone, Meet Pixel -- Google has jettisoned the Nexus brand that it long used for the smartphones it sells directly to the public, shifting to Pixel — the name it previously used for its Pixel C tablet and the recently discontinued Chromebook Pixel laptop. Google’s new phones bear the monikers Pixel and Pixel XL. Aesthetically, the Pixel devices might strike many as iPhone copycats with roughly comparable contours, though Google has opted to sheathe the aluminum devices front and back in glass — we all know how well that worked out for the iPhone 4 and 4s. Google does earn a few creativity points for the names of its phone colors: Very Silver, Quite Black, and the limited-edition Really Blue. More significantly, Google has added a raft of technical improvements to make the Pixel phones competitive with both the iPhone 7 and high-end phones from other Android-based phone makers. The Pixel’s 12-megapixel camera is one of the biggest shots across Apple’s bow. Google made much of the fact that the camera does not bulge the way the iPhone 7’s camera does, although the Pixel is slightly thicker overall than the iPhone 7. Even so, Google claims the camera is “the highest rated smartphone camera anyone has ever made” with a DxOMark Mobile score of 89, along with exceptional low-light performance (an iPhone 7 bragging point) and a Lens Blur feature to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects (similar to the iPhone’s new Portrait feature). But the Pixels lack one key camera feature: optical image stabilization, that’s found on both iPhone 7 models. For comparison, the iPhone 7 scored 86 on the DxOMark Mobile test. iPhone users may feel pangs of jealousy at Google’s offer of free, unlimited storage of original-quality, full-resolution photos and videos via its Google Photos service. Apple’s iCloud still offers just a measly 5 GB of free storage for use with iCloud Photo Library. Quick-charging technology gives the Pixel phones another edge over the iPhone 7. The Google handsets can go from uncharged to about 7 hours of battery life with only 15 minutes of charging via an 18-watt charger plugged into a USB-C port and a technology called USB-PD (Power Direct). Apple could presumably bring quick-charging technology to the iPhone since the 12.9-inch iPad Pro already has rapid charging (see “iPad Pro Charges Faster with MacBook Adapter and New Cable,” 27 April 2016). Google has kept its fingerprint sensor on the back of its handsets, and not on the front like iPhones. The goal is to allow users to pick up and authenticate in one fell swoop, though that’s easy to do on the iPhone as well. The Pixel phones are, behind the scenes, a significant Google strategy shift since the company had previously partnered with third-party hardware makers for its Nexus phones. Now, it says, it is “bringing hardware and software design under one roof,” although it’s still outsourcing the actual manufacturing. Sound familiar? The 5-inch Pixel starts at $649 and the 5.5-inch XL at $769 — both with 32 GB of storage. The phones max out at 128 GB of storage. Both are slated to ship later this month. Google at Your Service -- The Pixels are also the first Android smartphones to incorporate the intelligent new Google Assistant (see “Google I/O 2016 Includes Announcements with Apple Appeal,” 23 May 2016), which is roughly comparable to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. As also revealed last May, Google Assistant is also the core of the new Google Home voice-activated hardware that competes directly with Amazon’s Echo device and has — to the dismay of some — no direct Apple equivalent. Google Home will, though, work with both iOS and Android devices. Google had no major new revelations about Google Assistant and Google Home, except to say the latter will ship in November 2016 and start at $129 with a white top and gray fabric-covered base. More color schemes are on the way to match different home decor. Virtual Reality, Step Two -- Google has for several years done a good job promoting the emergent virtual-reality technology via its Cardboard goggles (see “On the iPhone, Virtual Reality Is Unofficially Real,” 17 June 2016). The slew of available Cardboard versions from Google and third-party makers tend to be simple by design in order to remain affordable. But now Google is starting a fresh chapter in its virtual-reality crusade with second-generation goggles called Daydream View. For now, the Daydream View is fully compatible only with the Pixel handsets. Compatibility with other Android phones is coming, but Google didn’t comment on future iPhone compatibility. Physically, a smartphone fits into the Daydream View’s flip-down lid, which you then close to make the phone into the VR brains and viewer once you put the goggles on your head. The Daydream View and Pixel pair automatically — similar to how Apple’s AirPods will pair with Macs and iOS devices. The Daydream View adds a new element: a small handheld controller vaguely reminiscent of Apple’s pre-Siri Apple TV remote that enables a degree of interactivity. Google notes that the new controller “points where you point and is packed with sensors to understand your movements and gestures. You can swing it like a bat, or wave it like a wand. And it’s so precise that you can draw with it.” When not in use, the controller stores on the inside of the Daydream View’s flip-out lid. Now, why didn’t Apple think of something like this for its easy-to-misplace Pencil? Mesh Wi-Fi — Apple’s AirPort Wi-Fi base stations have seen precious few updates in recent years. Meanwhile, other hardware makers have steadily advanced the state of the Wi-Fi art. One popular approach revolves around selling access points in sets of three or more to improve coverage (via what is called a “mesh network” in some cases). Eero has made a name for itself with such a system (see “Eero Provides Good Wi-Fi Coverage in a Handsome Package,” 25 June 2016). Google is now getting into this game with a device called Google Wifi that will be sold in multiples, unlike the company’s older OnHub Wi-Fi router (see “Google OnHub Router Aims to Simplify Wi-Fi for Everyone,” 19 August 2015, and “Google’s OnHub Router Gets Rough Treatment in Early Reviews,” 31 August 2015). The gadgets, which are short, white cylinders with wraparound light rings, create a residence-wide mesh network. According to Google, they are simple to set up, have robust privacy features, and auto-adjust to optimize performance — these are all Eero claims to fame. Google Wifi will be available in November 2016 for $129 for a single device, or $299 for a three-pack. Chromecast, Take Three -- While Apple has taken a sophisticated streaming-box approach with its full-featured Apple TV, Google keeps things simpler with its Chromecast video-streaming and audio-streaming accessories. The Chromecast devices certainly aren’t pretty. The video-streaming version, now in its third generation, is a coin-like gadget with a short HDMI cord that hangs from a TV’s rear or side HDMI port. There is no remote, either. You have to use your phone (it supports both the iPhone and Android phones) to pull up online streaming content that you then send to the TV via the Chromecast. Google’s new Chromecast Ultra features significant improvements, though, like 4K video and High Dynamic Range support, better Wi-Fi performance, and an Ethernet port for situations where Wi-Fi doesn’t work well. The Apple TV notably lacks support for 4K video and HDR, though it has long sported an Ethernet port. Google integrated the Chromecast Ultra with the new Google Home device, so you’ll be able to use Google Home to control a Chromecast Ultra with your voice, much like Siri on the Apple TV. That should get around some of the pain of not having a remote. Chromecast Ultra will become available in November 2016 for $69, a bargain compared to the Apple TV, which starts at $149. Competition Makes the World Go Round -- Nothing Google announced at its this product event is likely to make an Apple user jump ship. Sure, Apple users who followed these Google revelations might be a bit jealous due to the lack of fast charging in the iPhones, the absence of HDR and 4K in the Apple TV, the dearth of innovation in Apple’s AirPort base stations, the lack of an Amazon Echo/Google Home competitor, and Apple’s no-show status in the increasingly active virtual-reality field. But that’s not the point. Apple’s gear has plenty of other advantages for now, and Google’s improvements keep Apple from resting on its product design laurels. And that results in better technology for us all.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Here’s why Verizon says it will push Android updates for Pixel 'at the same time' as Google By Julian Chokkattu — October 12, 2016 9:18 AM Subscribe to this topic Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Thinking about buying one of the new Pixel smartphones from Google? If you want the latest and best Android has to offer, they’re a good bet. But whatever you do, don’t buy a Pixel from Verizon. Google’s Pixel smartphones are more expensive than previous Google Nexus devices, but they feature strong software and hardware integration, a promise of fast updates, and the artificially intelligent Google Assistant. They’re priced almost exactly the same as the iPhone and Samsung’s flagship devices, and it’s clear Google is vying to steal some of the pair’s customers. It’s fairly easy to pre-order Google’s smartphones. All you need to do is head over to Google’s website, choose your model, and pay off the device in one payment, or 24 monthly ones. You’ll get the Pixel or Pixel XL unlocked — that means you can use it on a wide variety of carriers. You may have seen advertisements from Verizon “introducing” the Pixel and the Pixel XL. The ads typically end with the tagline “Only on Verizon” — this is simply not true. When purchased through Google, the phone works on Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint. Verizon is the only carrier Google has partnered with to sell the device online and in stores. If you’re considering purchasing one of Google’s new phones from Verizon, here’s why going through the Google Store may be better. Do you trust Verizon for fast updates? One of the main reasons for buying a Nexus smartphone is that updates — both security and Android versions — come straight from Google. That’s still one of the top features of the Pixel line, except that if you buy it through Verizon, Big Red will be in charge of issuing version updates. Initially, a Google representative told 9to5Google that, “Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store.” But Verizon and Google have now confirmed that Pixel devices, whether bought through the Google Store or from Verizon, will receive updates from Google “simultaneously.” “Security and version updates will roll out at the same time across phones purchased through Verizon and through Google,” a Verizon spokesperson told Digital Trends. This marks a big shift in how Android devices have traditionally been updated on carrier products. For example, the Verizon variant of the Samsung Galaxy S6 received Android 6.0 Marshmallow nearly 7 months after Google released the Android version. “Verizon will not stand in the way of any major updates and users will get all updates at the same time as Google,” a representative told Ars Technica. A Google representative followed up with the site and said, “OS updates and monthly security patches will be updated on all Pixel devices (Verizon and non-Verizon versions) simultaneously.” Earlier, we spotted a Verizon representative in the FAQ section for the Google Pixel saying the carrier isn’t “able to guarantee every single update the Google offers, but we definitely do offer updates for all of our smartphones.” It seems as though Google has been able to gain tighter control of its devices, even if they are sold via carriers. Still, given Verizon’s history we can’t ensure you’ll consistently get updates on time. We’ll have to wait and see if this new update process rings true. Fast updates are important because each update brings security patches and new features to your phone. If you don’t want to run the risk of not receiving the latest, greatest, and safest Android software, buy a Pixel from Google. Beware the bloatware There will be three pre-installed non-Google apps on the smartphone: Verizon Messages, Go90, and My Verizon. All three apps should be uninstallable, but you could always purchase the device from Google and have it free of all bloatware. Related: 14 devices, 6 years, 1 name: Revisiting every Google Nexus ever built If you want these apps, they’re still available on the Play Store for download. Locked bootloader The average consumer may not care about this point as much as the others, but the Verizon variant of the Google Pixel smartphones will feature an encrypted, or locked bootloader. That means users will not be able to unlock it to root their smartphone — the Android equivalent of jailbreaking your iPhone. Tech enthusiasts and tinkerers will care about this more, but it’s important to know in case you ever want to resell the device, or have thoughts about rooting your smartphone. You may be able to get a cheaper price from Verizon A Verizon representative has confirmed with Digital Trends that Wi-Fi Calling and HD Voice will be available on the Pixel smartphones when bought through the Google Store. Constant updates, the option to root or have the bootloader unlocked, and the lack of bloatware are enough reasons to choose the Google Store over Verizon. You can even get interest-free device financing options for the Pixels from Google, just like Verizon offers. What’s neat is that if you purchase the device from Google, you’re still able to use it on all carriers including Verizon. A Verizon representative says the devices are carrier unlocked, meaning they should work on other major carriers such as AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint. Also, take note — a Best Buy representative has confirmed with Digital Trends that the Pixel smartphones only work on Verizon when bought through the retailer. Having the Pixel phones available at Verizon is a good thing for Google because it gets the search giant’s new devices into more peoples hands. There are even rumors floating that AT&T may get the Pixels within the first week of November as well. Regardless, Android is fragmented, and buying your device locked from a third-party isn’t going to help you get the most up-to-date software. Still, you might be able to get a better price on the Pixel — especially with trade-in deals. That alone may be enough for people to buy the device from Big Red. We still recommend you buy the Pixel unlocked from Google, and wait for it to come back in stock. We’ll have to wait and see if Verizon devices will indeed get updates at the same time as other Pixel phones, but  you’ll also get an unlocked bootloader with the Google Store variant. Updated on 10-12-2016 by Julian Chokkattu: Added confirmation that Wi-Fi Calling and HD Voice will work on Verizon even if a device is bought through Google. Verizon says it will push Android updates at the same time as Google.

From what we’ve seen and tried with Assistant so far, Google has something impressive here, and now you can use it on any device with Android Nougat (via XDA). Note: 9to5Google is not responsible for any issues with your device by following this tutorial. To get going, the first prerequisite is to ensure you’re running a compatible version of the Google app. Any version past 6.5.35.21 will work, in our case we used version 6.6.14.21. Please do note that we’ve only tested this on the Nexus 6P, but it should work on any rooted device running Android Nougat. Once you have that version installed, you’ll need to make some changes to your build.prop file. This will require that you are rooted. If you are, you’ll need to change your product model to Pixel XL and add a line as listed below. ro.product.model=Pixel XL
ro.opa.eligible_device=true Once you’ve made these changes, save the file and reboot your device. Once you’ve rebooted, you’ll need to clear the data and cache on the Google app. After that, you should have Google Assistant. Simply long press the home button to try it out. As mentioned, we’ve only tested this on the Nexus 6P, but it should work on any device running Nougat since there’s nothing tying it to the 6P. As long as you’re rooted, this should work. If you give it a shot on another device and it’s successful, leave a comment below and let us know! If it doesn’t work, you can of course still use Assistant in Allo.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Pixel pre-review videos show all release details Chris Burns - Oct 11, 2016 6 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit A collection of videos of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL have appeared on YouTube along with explanations of tests being run. These videos shot of and with the devices were captured by a fellow by the name of Matthew Glass. It’s alluded to that he’s a sales rep from a store like Best Buy – or something – he’s suggests that his “rep status doesn’t affect [his] perspective of the quality of this phone.” Or these phones, as it were. Just a bit before more “official” reviews of the Google Pixel and Google Pixel came the videos that are posted below. They all come from this one sales rep – as he suggests he is, at least – and posted in turn to Reddit. There, he answered quite a few questions rather frankly. Above are two photos apparently captured by the devices M.Glass has on-hand, the Nexus 6P and the Pixel XL. Below is a close-up of these two photos – notice how an entire extra layer of detail can be seen in the photo captured by the Pixel XL. The video below shows how quickly the Pixel XL boots up from being switched completely off. Below is a “Camera test” with the Pixel XL and a Nexus 6P. Of note – these devices have similar displays, but the Pixel XL should be a bit quicker due to its processor’s more advanced nature. Next is Google Assistant in action. The next video is odd. It shows both the Nexus 6P and the Pixel XL playing the same video while the sound is turned up or off on either device. It’s difficult to tell which device sounds better than the other. But perhaps that’s the point. Then there’s video stabilization. Electronic Image Stabilization in the device with the camera app – the camera app which is unique to Pixel devices, note.

Now, Google is making it easier for families and groups to take advantage of the carrier with the introduction of group plans. Google has gone out of its way to make added members as easy as possible. Users can be added to your plan at a cost of $15 per user and the price for data remains at $10 per GB. You will still be refunded for any data you do not use and it is extremely easy to add and remove users — which can be done through the Project Fi app. Related: Does the Google Pixel really have the best smartphone camera? Judge for yourself Unfortunately, not everyone can join Project Fi — additional members will still need to adhere to the compatible devices list, which only includes the Google Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel, and Pixel XL smartphones. There are a few big advantages to Project Fi, beyond the price. Project Fi essentially borrows network coverage from T-Mobile, Sprint, and U.S. Cellular. What that means is that you will use whatever network is strongest at any given moment — and you will get far more coverage than if you were using one of those networks. On the group plan, you will also be able to set personal notifications for data use, and the manager of the account can monitor the amount of data that each person is using and even set data allowances for each person — which is perfect if you happen to have a Netflix addict on your Project Fi plan. Google also has you covered if you are looking for a new smartphone. The Nexus 5X comes at $150 off and the 6P at $100 off. The Pixel and Pixel XL understandably keep their prices, but you can finance those through the Play Store. Also watch: OnePlus 3 Review Please enable Javascript to watch this video

We have a review of Assistant’s current functionality, but in a nutshell, it’s essentially a conversation-based version of the former Google Now. XDA user brianelv has posted a short guide on enabling Assistant, and it should work on any rooted Android 7.0 (or higher) device with the Google app 6.5.35.21 or newer. If you have those prerequisites, the actual guide is fairly short.

Possumato to Speak at Digital Dealer Workshops on Utilizing Proximity Marketing and Beacons John F. Possumato, the Founder & CEO of Automotive Mobile Solutions will speak to automotive dealers at the Digital Dealer Workshops, Cherry Hill, New Jersey, October 18, on utilizing proximity Marketing and beacon technology using Mobile (Apple/Google) Wallet and customized apps. Participants in the workshop will learn what proximity marketing (geo-fencing) is, and how it can best be used in the automotive environment, using compliant best practices and current examples of industry leading stores today. Participants will also learn about Mobile (Apple/Google) Wallet technologies, the advantages and drawbacks in using Wallet as a tool for their proximity marketing program. Finally, those attending will also explore the benefits and potential pitfalls in creating and utilizing their own dealership customized app as a strategy to achieve proximity marketing goals.   View as PDF  Print View    October 1, 2016, Cherry Hill, NJ � Organizers of the upcoming Digital Dealer Workshops have announced that John Possumato, CEO of Automotive Mobile Solutions (AMS) will lead an automotive dealer focused presentation on emerging proximity marketing, geo-fencing and beacon technologies using Mobile (Apple & Google) Wallet and customized dealership apps. AMS�s founder, attorney and digital marketing expert, John Possumato, said dealers are just beginning to explore the marketing possibilities of mobile wallet technology, which is built into every new iPhone and Android smartphone. �Proximity marketing techniques, such as geo-fencing and using strategically placed beacons, provide the ultimate leverage for acquiring low cost, dealer generated low-in-the-funnel sales leads,� Possumato said. �Long term, relationship building development is nice, but being able to �Reach Out, When they are Ready to Buy!� (the title of our workshop), is critical to actually making the sale, in vehicles sales or service operations� Possumato continues, �Retail is a cutthroat competition these days, and dealers need a new way to cost-effectively gain leverage in the consumer�s �back pocket� with time-sensitive, location-based offers. Flash sales for both variable and fixed operations are now possible through geo-fencing and beacons through mobile wallet and customized apps, and in ways that have never been available before this technology emerged on the scene.� Possumato added that a number of major retailers, including Starbucks, Best Buy and Macy�s, are using mobile wallet to connect with customers and keep them coming back. He plans to discuss the technology in �Reach Out When They Are Ready to Buy!� at 1:30 on Tuesday, Oct 18, at the Digital Dealer Workshops, at the Crowne Plaza in Cherry Hill, NJ. Registration for Digital Dealer Workshops is open at the event�s http://www.digitaldealer.com/workshops. For more information the Mobile Wallet Digital Business Card made for the event, click here.

Google (via YouTube) Listen to this story 25 min 44 sec Share Share via Emailemail Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Recently, when Google announced its own version of Amazon's voice-recognition digital home assistant, the company did not spend a moment addressing any privacy safeguards nor concerns. As Wall Street Journal tech reporter Geoffrey Fowler tweeted: "So just to review, Google says it wants to install microphones all over your house. And didn't talk about privacy." In addition to Google's Home device (with the assisting software named "Assistant") and Amazon's Echo (with software named "Alexa"), Apple is trying to broaden Siri's capabilities and Sony is developing its Xperia Agent, each with the initial aim of controlling a smart-home universe including music stereos, lighting, temperature, sprinklers, even security. The hands-free devices work by being programmed to recognize the voices of their owners. One privacy safeguard with the Echo is that the device is engineered to light up when it's listening, plus users can delete voice command history. Americans have been buying the Echo so quickly that market researchers call it a sleeper hit, with an estimated 3 million sold in the last two years. The products are not just hands-free remote controls, their artificial intelligence personas tell jokes and learn from their interactions with users. On AirTalk, we'll discuss and debate whether the technologies are worth any privacy trade-offs, or whether Americans should be wary of inviting the potential of Big Brother in their homes. Guests:  Aleecia McDonald, Non-resident fellow, Center for Internet and Society, Stanford Law School Douglas Rushkoff, writer, documentarian, and lecturer whose work focuses on human autonomy in a digital age; His latest book is titled “Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus: How Growth Became the Enemy of Prosperity”  The best SoCal news in your inbox, daily.

Live feed Show 4.38pm EDT 16:38 A clean sheet keeps England’s unbeaten run in qualifying matches going and makes sure they remain top of Group F. But Slovenia were the better team tonight and had the chances to win. They let themselves down with some shoddy finishing, however, while England were indebted to some fabulous saves from Joe Hart. After that performance, it’s safe to say that Wayne Rooney wasn’t the only problem. Gareth Southgate has plenty to think about. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye.

A poor tackle from an increasingly poor player. Tempers are threatening to boil over now, both sets of players coming together to dispute the rights and wrongs of that foul by Cahill. Jesse Lingard, right, looks agrieved as players from both sides clash as referee Deniz Aytekin intervenes.

Moments later, Lingard lets fly from 25 yards. Oblak brilliantly tips it wide. “I reckon Suarez or Ronaldo could push old grannies in the street or dress like Killer Clows and terrorise young kids and they’d still be more likeable than Daniel Bloody Sturridge,” says Kevin Wilson.

The angle’s too tight for a shot, though. The right option is to pull the ball across goal for Rooney or Lingard. Or so you’d think. Sturridge scuffs a shot straight at Oblak. What’s wrong with him?

The Slovenian attacker is too sharp for Cahill, though. He’s there first and he’s through on goal. A heavy touch allows Hart to close the angle, though, and the England goalkeeper saves his team-mates again, sprawling at Ilicic’s feet and diverting it behind for a corner. He’s been huge tonight.

His shot is straight at Oblak. “What we need is a manager who can look at the talent pool, make tough choices, select a squad able to win, and set the underperforming on the bench,” says Patrick Sullivan. “Oh wait, our man did that.

He was briefly down with what seemed to be a concussion and Fraser Forster was getting ready. But Hart has decided that he can continue after a chat with the physio. He’s got an excuse for feeling groggy. How about his defenders? Oof, that’s gotta hurt. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters Updated at 3.59pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.49pm EDT 15:49 47 min: England are in disarray at the back. Birsa’s corner is flicked into the six-yard box for Cesar, who can’t smuggle it past Hart, the England goalkeeper brilliantly turning it behind. From the second corner, Kurtic, the man who hit the post in the first half, darts to the near post and directs a stunning header towards the top corner. Again, however, Hart somehow claws the ball out, with the aid of the corner of post and bar, before it can cross the line! What a save! That is incredible.

Slovenia are immediately on the attack and should take the lead after some pure magnificence from Illicic. He brings a high ball down on the right side of the area and proceeds to make a fool out of a slew of England defenders. A lovely one-two plays him in on goal but instead of shooting, he cuts it back to Theo Walcott, who makes sure not to score an own goal. Why didn’t he shoot? Corner to Slovenia.

INNOVATE Google Is Trying to Get an Edge in the Assistant Wars by Hiring Comedy Writers The company is trying to spice up the language of the Google Home. By Kevin J. Ryan Kevin J. Ryan is a reporter for Inc. He has written for ESPN The Magazine and the Long Island Press and contributed to Mental Floss. He lives in Queens, New York. @wheresKR Reporter, Inc.@wheresKR WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Courtesy Google Advertisement Artificial intelligence, in practice, isn't very funny. Ask Siri or Amazon Alexa to tell you a joke, and you'll probably get something a 10-year-old would scrunch her nose at. Google wants to change that. The company unveiled Google Home, its Amazon Echo-like home assistant, last week. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google hired writers from places like Pixar and the Onion to help spice up the Home's dialogue and give its AI more personality. Apparently there's more work to be done: As Tech Crunch points out, Google currently has a job listing for someone with "experience writing dialogue for plays/screenplays, fiction/interactive fiction, and/or comedy/entertainment." Personality can be hard to nail down in AI. Even if it has the ability to answer questions accurately, an electronic assistant tends to lack the pull that makes you want to keep talking to them once the novelty wears off. A sense of humor could help solve that. For some people, it'll be that emotional connection and unpredictability that keeps them using it--or gets them to buy it in the first place. Google wouldn't be the first to turn to creative types for help with its AI. Tech startup Anki hired an animator from Pixar to help give its new toy robot, Cozmo, some personality. The company went so far as to create a storyboard for Cozmo, making him not only a toy, but a character with different emotional states. As Anki recently told Inc., it takes one set of skills to create functional, robust AI--but a very different skill set to create something that can express emotion. Having teams with both sets can help give AI that extra push it needs. Google Home will retail for $129 in stores and online beginning November 4. Published on: Oct 11, 2016 Advertisement

Today Project Fi is getting beefed up again. Google is adding group plans to Project Fi. With a group plan, you can have up to six people on a single plan, and each person gets all the benefits of Fi. Pricing for group plans starts at $15 per line for unlimited talk and text (compared to $20 for a single user), and you can add data at a rate of $10 per gigabyte. If you end up using less data than you paid for, Google will credit you for the data that you didn’t use. All members will appear on a single bill, and you can members can be added or removed at any time. Each member of a group plan can view their own data usage in the Project Fi app, and the group plan’s manager can view the usage for each member. Both members and managers can set data notifications to help keep track of usage, and managers can also set monthly data allowances per member and pause data service if necessary. Project Fi group plans are launching today. To celebrate, Google is offering $100 off the Nexus 6P and $150 off the Nexus 5X when you activate through Project Fi. The major US carriers have long offered family plans, giving you an easy way to get service with your loved ones, often for a bit less than they'd pay on their own. That's why it's good to see Project Fi finally get family plans of its own, making it easier for a group of people to be on Google’s service. For example, now a family can all be on Fi, and a parent can easily manage their kids’ data usage. Plus, Project Fi group plan customers can get a slight discount on talk and text compared to single customers, too. Are you on Project Fi? If so, will you be signing up for a group plan?

It’s a fresh view into Facebook’s arrogance, both toward its advertisers and its nearly two billion users. Nothing’s new under the sun, of course — pride has goeth-ed before a fall for all of human history. And obviously does in the digital sphere, too: Facebook FB, -1.47%  and its principal digital advertising rival, Google GOOG, -1.12% have been behaving as though customs and principles that have governed the advertising business for its entire history simply don’t apply to them. Businesses based on selling time or space to advertisers have almost always allowed third parties to measure their effectiveness at obtaining eyeballs. The print-publishing industry had the advertiser-created Audit Bureau of Circulations looking over its shoulder, while the broadcast and cable industries had Nielsen and Arbitron ratings that independently determined viewership of TV and radio shows. This “third-party verification” setup is just about the only way to get reliable data without self-interested bias or spin. You’d think this matter could be easily solved with a big dose of transparency. That kind of oversight on behalf of advertisers is especially critical for platforms like Facebook and Google’s YouTube, which are so-called “walled garden” sites. That means you usually view content created by other media companies and individuals without leaving Facebook or YouTube — the content plays inside their “fence.” Which, in turn, means Facebook and YouTube are in complete control of all the data regarding clicks, views, demographics and other advertiser-coveted data. But the two giants have only recently made begrudging steps toward this kind of third-party verification. Facebook started allowing analytics firm Moat to begin a limited beta test on its site this year, while YouTube announced it would allow certain “viewability vendors” to begin to monitor its video ads. But they did so only under heavy pressure from major paying customers, who were tired of bankrolling multi-billion dollar digital ad budgets without knowing exactly what was and wasn’t being seen by consumers. And Facebook and Google also didn’t give the new third-party monitors full access to monitor and measure whatever they wanted to. They can only verify, for now, limited ad viewability data. Watching this unfold feels a great deal like an Iranian nuclear program negotiation: Both companies still have their hands wrapped tightly around the neck of the outside monitors, the access to information is far from complete, and in the end you can’t help but be left with the feeling that both companies are hiding something. Why is this one Facebook “mistake” so telling? Probably because the metric is so key to digital advertisers. Video advertising is largely not used to drive direct responses; it’s used as air cover for building brand image and awareness. If you’re an advertiser trying to measure return on your investment, the length of time consumers are spending watching your digital video ads is about the best proxy you can get for an effectiveness index. When advertisers can’t calculate or gather that data from independent sources because the social-media site they’re buying ads from won’t be transparent, and when that same site then turns around and says, “whoops — we have been overstating your key index by 80% for the past two years,” that’s a major problem in the digital-advertising world. What’s worse is that Facebook’s claimed engagement numbers were orders of magnitude higher than any other platform. Facebook claimed superior targeting as the reason, asserting they had simply created a vastly more effective marketing machine. But in the light of day, that comparison now looks more like a 2007 Bernie Madoff investor presentation than it does evidence of a better mousetrap. Like those frustrating nuclear negotiations, you’d think this matter could be easily solved with a big dose of transparency. And like those nuclear negotiations, you’d be forgiven for concluding it’ll never happen. Facebook’s response has been to rename and recalculate the metric on which they were caught cheating. Sleight of hand still rules. No one knows exactly how the “mistake” was discovered, or why Facebook was excluding viewers who clicked away from the video at the first seconds of the ad (artificially boosting the average viewing time). The beta implementation of the third-party platforms clearly could have led to it – and if that’s the case, what else will be uncovered as the waters of obfuscation recede? If they recede, that is. Both companies have well-deserved reputations for doing what’s best for them, and advertisers and users alike can like it or lump it. What are the take-away lessons from all this inside-baseball controversy? First, like in all the rest of the world, numbers that look too good to be true usually are too good to be true. The biggest media platform in the world was claiming its video-engagement performance was vastly better than every other media site’s, flashing performance numbers that seemed ridiculous to informed observers. So either A. Facebook believed its own hype, or B. They knew their numbers were juiced and kept on using them for as long as they could. Second, digital advertising continues to be the Okefenokee Swamp of modern marketing, with virtually no visibility and plenty of danger lurking in the muck. The uncorrected average Facebook video view duration was reported by one source last year to be about 18 seconds; an 80% “error” would put that average view duration at just 10 seconds. Meaning there’s a huge amount of wasted ad spend even in so-called “performance marketing.” Meanwhile, adblocking continues its unabated growth, with media sites desperately trying to figure out what policies or work-arounds or adblocker blockers to deploy. What’s needed to ameliorate this mess is full transparency to the advertiser about how their media behaves. Programmatic ad buying, and in fact all digital advertising, has a lot of warts on it. It’s not like marketers are unaware of the fact, and yet many media platforms want to pretend it’s not true. The first step in wart removal, of course, is admitting you’ve got a wart. If the industry would take that simple, yet profound, step of transparency, its path toward a more stable, bad-surprise-free future would be greatly enhanced. Real data and metrics can help guide marketers to make better ad placements. Better placements, in turn, help align ad content with consumers who actually want and need to see it, which means they’re more valuable to the advertisers and therefore capable of generating more revenue for the media site. Which, in turn, could once again begin to build a healthy content ecosystem. That’s a much healthier dynamic than having 90% of us angrily poking away to close an invasive mobile ad that’s trying to seize control of our smartphone. This is a seminal moment in a business that’s really only existed for seven years. If advertisers band together to demand a more open, less high-handed set of behaviors from Facebook and Google — who between them have created almost a trillion dollars of market capitalization — the expectations for performance and transparency can be reset. If a stand isn’t taken here, the beatings are likely to get worse.

By George Avalos / October 11, 2016 at 9:58 AM The Samsung phone debacle has opened the door — just a crack — for Google to make headway with its fledgling smartphone offering, Pixel, analysts said Tuesday. South Korea-based Samsung permanently halted production on the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after reports of the phone overheating and, in some cases, catching fire. “It’s a huge opportunity for the Google Pixel,” said Rob Enderle, an Oregon-based analyst who tracks the tech sector. “The Pixel is the best phone to take advantage of this problem. But its carrier limitations are going to offset what would otherwise be an incredibly well-timed opportunity.” Google faces plenty of challenges even as the tech behemoth maneuvers to capitalize on Samsung’s woes. “Google can use Samsung’s problems to their advantage, but they have a really big upward climb,” said Ben Bajarin, a principal analyst with Campbell-based Creative Strategies. For one thing, the Pixel phone is available only for the Verizon platform and isn’t being offered for other big carriers such as Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile. “Google is just starting out, and consumers still need to learn what the Pixel phone is,” Bajarin said. “Samsung’s problems will benefit the established brands such as Apple, LG and HTC. Established brands are very powerful things.” Mountain View-based Google, nevertheless, has the potential to cast a mammoth shadow over Samsung as it scrambles to reverse its misfortunes with the Galaxy Note 7. “Samsung has created a market for a phone like this, but doesn’t have a phone for this market,” Enderle said. “Google Pixel can slide right into that spot. But the Pixel just won’t be able to take over a lot of shelf space because it’s only available on one carrier.” Cupertino-based Apple is certain to be the top vendor for smartphones during the final three months of 2016, Bajarin said. That stretch that covers the vital holiday shopping season. “We acknowledge the inconvenience this may cause in the market,” Samsung said of the recall of the phone and the halt in production “This is to ensure that Samsung continues to deliver the highest quality products to our customers.”   Photo: Rick Osterloh, Google senior vice president of hardware, introduces the new Google Pixel phone Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016, in San Francisco.

Redwood City-based Oracle lost a lawsuit against Google when a federal jury in May found the Mountain View search giant had properly used the Java code under the “fair use” provision in U.S. copyright law. The law allows use of copyrighted material in limited circumstances based on the scope of use, to what extent the purpose is commercial, and the effect of the use on the material’s value or market potential. The Copyright Act provision can also permit use on the basis of whether it’s “transformative.” As a Stanford Library fact sheet puts it, “At issue is whether the material has been used to help create something new or merely copied verbatim into another work.” In what stretched into an epic, six-year battle, Oracle had been seeking up to $9 billion in damages from Google. A judge already rejected a bid in May by Oracle to get the verdict thrown out. But the software and cloud company hasn’t given up. On July 6, Oracle filed a motion in San Francisco U.S. District Court again asking the same judge, William Alsup, to toss the verdict. The company cited case law suggesting use is not legal if the user “exclusively acquires conspicuous financial rewards” from its use of the copyrighted material. Google, said Oracle, has earned more than $42 billion from Android. “Google’s financial rewards are as ‘conspicuous’ as they come, and unprecedented in the case law,” Oracle’s filing said. Oracle wants the judge to adhere to the narrower and more traditional applications of fair use, “for example, when it is ‘criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching … scholarship, or research.'” Judge Alsup had noted in rejecting Oracle’s first attempt at scuttling the verdict that the jury could have “reasonably found” that the commercial use also “served noncommercial purposes as well, i.e., as part of a free and open software platform, namely Android.” Google has consistently argued that the Java code was free and open to all and that its use of the code was transformative. During the recent case, Google argued that Sun Microsystems, which created Java in the 1990s long before it was bought by Oracle, had no problem with Google using the code without a license. “We didn’t pay for the free and open things,” Larry Page, CEO of Google’s parent company Alphabet, testified during the trial.

While this leak might not last forever, right this minute, users are able to attain access to Google Assistant with a manual edit of their device’s build.prop file. Users that have no idea what a build.prop would do well to skip this process, as it could have adverse and negative effects on their device’s software, and therefore end experience. Below is a tiny demo of whats possible with Google Assistant, as provided during Google’s most recent press event in which the Pixel and Pixel XL were both introduced. These devices will be the first two to use Google Assistant in the form seen here – and flashable here – while future Google devices may have it too. Users will also be able to find Google Assistant in the Google Allo app, also available for download for free on Google Play. SEE THIS: “The Google Assistant” is the AI sci-fi promised us Google Assistant is just one of a list of features that Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL will have exclusively. This also includes Unlimited original quality photo/video backup to Google Photos, Pixel Launcher (swipe up for all apps, new Search Box, date/weather header on home), and the Pixel Camera app. For more on that, have a peek at our brief Google Pixel exclusive features feature. Straight from XDA Developers forum comes the following two lines of code. Users that have access to their Android device’s build.prop will have only to add or replace these two lines: ro.product.model=Pixel XL ro.opa.eligible_device=true These same users will need to wipe their Google app data completely so as to reboot the system. Users will also need Android 7.0 Nougat (or higher) as well as the newest version of the Google app – that’s build “Velvet” as of the publishing of this article, version 6.5.35.21 or newer. Over at Android File Host are several flash-friendly files as posted by FraserF. These zip files can be flashed using any of a variety of 3rd-party recovery systems. Users that wish to take part in these downloads – as well as any other modification to their Android device as described or linked to in this article – will need to do so at their own risk. Below is Google’s first “Google Assistant” promotional video. This Google Assistant system will also be available in Google Home, as shown in the video below.

The Project Fi network hops between T-Mobile, Sprint, and U.S. Cellular to keep users connected. It’s a great option for those who want basic cell service and don’t require a ton of mobile data. Project Fi has been out for a while now and Google has decided to make it more cheap and easy to use. It has introduced a family plan for Project Fi. Existing Project Fi users can now add up to fix people on their plan. They will have to pay $15 per month per user and for this, they receive unlimited talk and text. This brings down the cost from $20 which individual users are required to pay when they come to Project Fi. Google has maintained the $10 per GB rate for mobile data. Users will only get charged for the amount of data that they use. So if they have 2GB of data on their plan which costs $20 per month but they only use 1GB, they will get $10 back. It allows users to set data limits for other users on their plan so that they can control how much data each person can use. The only caveat here is that Project Fi works with just three handsets. You must have a Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P or Google’s new Pixel smartphone in order to use the service. Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Google and Project Fi.

 Google DeepMind has doubled the size of its healthcare team Sam Shead Oct. 11, 2016, 12:52 PM 4,059 facebook linkedin twitter email print DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman heads up the DeepMind Health unit.Google DeepMind DeepMind, an AI research lab acquired by Google for £400 million in 2014, has provided an update on how its DeepMind Health unit is doing. The London-based company told Business Insider on Tuesday that it has doubled the size of its team from 20 to 40 since launching in February this year, hiring several big names in the AI world along the way. New hires include security and privacy expert Ben Laurie, who is the founding director of the Apache Software Foundation, a director at the Open Rights Group, and a veteran Google software engineer, and former CIO Tony Corkett, who helped the NHS to digitise X-rays. Former Google Maps team leader Andrew Eland has been brought in to head up DeepMind Health's engineering efforts, while Will Cavendish, a former civil servant that worked on NHS online booking and prescription services, has joined as strategy lead. Elsewhere, ex-GE Healthcare executive Cathy Harris has been appointed as DeepMind Health's product lead. All of the new hires will work alongside Mustafa Suleyman, DeepMind cofounder and head of applied AI at Google, and Dominic King, DeepMind Health's clinical lead. The expansion of DeepMind Health comes as the company looks to do increasing amounts of work with the NHS. The company has announced three NHS partnerships so far, including an eyecare project, a kidney monitoring project and a cancer detection project. None of the projects hold any commercial value for DeepMind but the company eventually plans to start charging the NHS and others for access to its products and services. The potential for AI to revolutionise healthcare is huge but there are issues that need to be addressed along the way, including complex matters like privacy, which caught out DeepMind earlier this year when New Scientist obtained an NHS information-sharing agreement between DeepMind and the Royal Free NHS Trust that showed the company had access to millions of medical records. "Since we announced DeepMind Health earlier this year, we’ve been inundated with requests and suggestions from patients, nurses, doctors, researchers and Trusts," said Suleyman in a statement. "It’s clear there’s massive demand for new technology to help patient care, and many brilliant people across the NHS with practical ideas about how to make it happen. "We also know that working in health is complicated, and we need many different types of expertise if we’re to build tools that have real clinical impact, integrate well with the needs and existing infrastructure of the NHS, and set ever higher standards for privacy and security. We don’t underestimate this challenge at all. "Over the last year we’ve brought together some amazing leaders with diverse skills and experiences to join us on this mission. With continued input from and engagement with patients and clinicians across the country, we’ll be working hard to deliver on the promise of positive impact for the NHS and those, like us, who depend on it." DeepMind had less than 100 employees when it was acquired by Google but the team has grown quickly over the last couple of years and now the overall headcount stands at over 250 people.  NOW WATCH: Elon Musk just unveiled something that could revolutionize how you power your home Loading video...

These are the inventors, strategists and entrepreneurs that make up the LinkedIn Next Wave 2016, a group of 120 individuals across a dozen different industries that are doing extraordinary work and transforming their fields. The list, which is driven by data from LinkedIn's global professional network and editorial research, features several top names in tech who are shaping the future of the industry. Check out 10 standout Next Wavers in the technology industry below — and see the full list here. Ian Bernstein CTO & Co-Founder, Sphero When Star Wars fans first saw that a new toy maker was on the market with a robot shaped like BB-8, the response was overwhelming. In just 12 hours, Sphero, the then hardly known robotics company based in Boulder, Colo., sold 22,000 units for $250 a pop. It's been a year since little BB-8 started rolling around over 1 million homes and offices around the country, and it's clear that Sphero is not your average toy company. Led by co-founders Ian Bernstein and Adam Wilson, 33 and 32, Sphero seeks to develop products that bring virtual reality alive in the physical world. The company — which has secured some $90 million in funding from lauded investors like Brad Feld of Foundry Group and The Walt Disney Company — now has a full suite of mobile-controlled products on the market like SPRK+, an app-enabled robot ball that teaches foundational programming through STEM activities in K12 education. And for Star Wars devotees, don't worry. A new and improved BB-8 robot is already on the market. Turns out, Bernstein and Wilson designed the first BB-8 without even seeing StarWars: The Force Awakens. Given its popularity, the new edition looks much more like what fans see on screen. Don Burnette Co-Founder, Otto While tech giants like Google, Lyft, Tesla and others race to get to market with autonomous cars, Burnette is thinking bigger — about 14 wheels bigger. A former Google engineer, 31-year-old Burnette is the co-founder of Otto, a self-driving trucking company recently acquired by Uber. Some 3.5 million Americans drive trucks professionally and Otto's technology has the potential to upend that industry. Otto execs see it a different way: drivers would be able to double their output from a typical 9-hour driving day by taking naps periodically while on the truck and then getting back to driving. The driverless tech is not complete yet, but Otto already has a fleet of six trucks driving around the streets and highways of California testing out new technology. Peter Deng Director of Product, Oculus Virtual reality stands to upend the tech industry as we know it, and Deng finds himself at the center of it all. The head of product management at Facebook's Oculus, Deng is working to ensure the Oculus Rift headset experience stays superior among a slew of other competitors just now getting into the VR game. While the device is currently known for its ultra-real gaming and entertainment experiences, the potential of the platform is powerful: A recent study found that physical therapy treatment using Oculus Rift allowed paraplegics to learn to walk again. Prior to coming over to lead Facebook VR division, Deng was the director of product at Instagram, where he saw the photo-sharing platform through its $1 billion acquisition to Facebook. Eric Piermont | AFP | Getty Images Peter Deng Yasmin Green Head of Research & Development, Jigsaw at Alphabet Green doesn't shy away from a challenge. As Head of Research and Development for Alphabet's Jigsaw incubator (formerly Google Ideas), the 35-year-old is tackling some of the world's greatest challenges — from censorship and online harassment to digital attacks and violent extremism. "We first try to understand how global security challenges intersect with the Internet," Green told LinkedIn, "and then design innovative technologies to respond." One of the highest profile: trying to not just block but reverse ISIS' online recruitment efforts. Green's team combined the power of Google's search advertising algorithms with YouTube's video platform to target aspiring ISIS recruits with messaging — based on insights from interviews with ISIS defectors — that could reverse the organization's brainwashing. The project, called the "Redirect Method," reached over 320,000 individuals and drove over half a million minutes of online video watch time. That's not all she's up to. She's also tackling the seemingly impossible task of combatting Internet trolling using open-source AI. Green's ultimate goal: "To use the best technology we have a tour disposal to tackle the world's toughest problems." Lexie Komisar Senior Lead, IBM Digital You likely know what IBM Watson is, but who you also need to know is Komisar. The senior lead and founding member of IBM's Digital Innovation Lab, Komisar is responsible for ensuring that the 105-year-old tech giant stays on top of emerging technologies and trends with startups. The lab recently launch edits first product, the IBM Learning Lab, which helps developers leverage IBM tech like artificial intelligence agent Watson. Before joining IBM, Komisar worked at the Clinton Foundation where she built the first program focused on tech and innovation, partnering with Fortune 500 companies like Facebook, government organizations like the New York Department of Health and startups like Jawbone. When 29-year-old Komisar isn't working away in IBM's Lab, she's running LadyBoss Collective, an organization she co-founded that's aimed at bringing emerging female leaders across industries together to share common goals and support each other. Nathan Kundtz CEO and president, Kymeta When Kundtz, gets in front of crowds to talk about his company's technology — satellite antennas — even he can't help but joke. "Did I just say antennas? Really?" he asks. "Is it 1920?" Except, there's a very modern need for his company's creation.Today's antennas are the choke point to the wireless airwaves available at higher altitudes from satellites, Kundtz says. Kymeta's thin antennas use "holographic metamaterials" to reach those connections, opening up "5000 times more capacity than we have today to cellphones," he said at a presentation in August. The company, backed by Bill Gates and others, raised another $62 million earlier this year and is already partnering with companies like Toyota to bring its antennas to moving vehicles. Kundtz has a Ph.D. in physics from Duke University and told a campus publication that he was drawn to the company because he "wanted to work on something that had a real-world applicability." Nancy Liang Senior product manager, Amazon Alexa Alexa, the voice service behind Amazon's Echo device, hasbeen hailed as "the first winning product of the conversational era." Inside Amazon, Liang, 30, is credited as the critical, behind-the-scenes contributor to the project. What exactly she's doing is subject to some secrecy. A senior product manager, Liang tells LinkedIn that her current focus is "voice-enabled products, 3D printing (and) creating the future of manufacturing." That fits with her background: She launched some of the first consumer 3D-printed products at Shapeways, creating food-safe ceramics, and then co-founded a custom 3D printing company called Mixee Labs, whose team later joined Amazon. (Liang herself memorably created a "Sad Keanu" figurine, based on the actor, that got massive attention.) She cites Amazon's Jeff Bezos among the execs she admires, and says her metric for success is simple: "It's all about how customer's lives are changed by my products." Jessica Matthews Founder & CEO, Uncharted Play Who says work and play need to be kept separate? Matthews created a soccer ball that doubles as a power generator to help families in developing countries stay out of the dark. Once praised by President Barack Obama, the soccer ball looks like a toy. It's anything but: Customizable micro-generators within the ball harness power from three different types of motion that is 7x more efficient that solar power. The 28-year-old founder has big plans to expand the tech behind Uncharted Play's soccer ball and place it in other objects like strollers, luggage, grocery carts and more. Matthews' leadership in the growing startup category dubbed the Internet of Things is impressive in its own right,but there is something else that makes her a standout as well: Last month she raised the largest Series A funding round for a black female CEO — ever. Skylar Tibbits Director, Self-Assembly Lab, MIT Tibbits, 31, is out to show that any material can achieve what he calls "robot-like functionality." At MIT's Self Assembly Lab, which he co-directs, he and his colleagues are programming physical materials that essentially build themselves. It sounds like some hazy, sci-fi dream: an object that changes shape on its own, without help from humans or machines. ButTibbits says this type of manufacturing could apply to any industry: a shoe that grows itself; a pipe that expands or contracts based on the flow of water. The objects store information in their geometry and respond to energy, like heat. "These programmable materials don't require any batteries, motors, sensors, computers, power," Tibbits tells LinkedIn. He got his start in architecture, working with famous firms like Zaha Hadid Architects, before moving to MIT. As for success, Tibbits says he looks for opportunities to surprise himself. "What is just fucking radical and awesome that we could be working on?" he tells LinkedIn. "How do we make it real and applicable to any industry and any challenge?" Nick Weaver Co-Founder and CEO, eero Weaver built his startup based on a problem that his parents complained about on a daily basis. Now he has $90 million in funding to solve that problem for them — and for millions of paying customers, he hopes. His startup, eero, is the maker of a smart wireless routing system that aims to put an end to weak internet connections. By placing several devices in separate corners of the home, eero creates a Wi-Fi signal that he says — and many tech writers back up — is stronger than any single router. The 28-year-old founder has some stiff competition with tech giants like Apple and other startups going after the same problem, but Weaver is convinced the tech behind his device will make him the standout winner going into the startup's first holiday season.

Better menu navigation. With a full list of menu options in the leftmost navigation bar, users can switch between reports much faster. The navigation bar is also now adjustable to give a viewer more room for report viewing. Consolidated customization. Custom reports, dashboards and alerts (previously in the Admin tab) will all be accessible from the main navigation bar, instead of spread between different tabs. Users can also save shortcuts to frequently visited reports. Want to stay up-to-date on the latest tactics and developments in Google Analytics, SEO, YouTube, AdWords and more? Check out the agenda for PR News' Google Boot Camp, Nov. 17 in NYC. Faster login. The disorienting effect of opening up a report in a completely different view than the last time it was visited has been nixed, so users will more easily be able to pick up where they left off. Adjustable default date range. For communicators that routinely gather metrics for a specified time frame (biweekly, monthly, etc.), a report's date range can be automatically set to a default period, saving time on adjusting dates once a report has been opened. Google has set the current default range to seven days, stating that "many campaign changes, website experiments...will have impacts hidden in a 30-day view but immediately visible on a shorter timeline."

SUBSCRIBE Why Google’s quality updates should be on your algorithmic radar [Part 2]: The connection to low-quality user experience In the second installment of his two-part series on Google's quality updates (aka Phantom updates), columnist Glenn Gabe explains the connection between user experience and organic search performance. Glenn Gabe on October 11, 2016 at 12:08 pm More In part one of this series, I covered a number of important points about Google’s quality updates (aka Phantom). I tried to provide a solid foundation for understanding what Phantom is and how it works, explaining its history, its path since 2015 and how it rolls out. In part two, I’m going to dive deeper by providing examples of “low-quality user engagement” that I’ve seen on sites affected by Phantom. I’ve analyzed and helped many companies that have been impacted by Google’s quality updates since May of 2015, and I’ve seen many types of quality problems during my travels. Today, I’ll try and explain more about those problems and provide some recommendations for sites that have been impacted. So fire up your proton packs. There’s ectoplasm ahead. Back to school, back to algorithm updates First, a quick note about what we’ve been seeing this fall so far. September of 2016 was one of the most volatile months in a long time from an algorithm update standpoint. We’ve witnessed a serious combination of updates since August 31, 2016. First, Joy Hawkins picked up a major local algorithm change that many in the local space are calling Possum. That was combined with what looked like another quality update starting on August 31 (I’m covering Google’s quality updates in this series). And to add to the already volatile September, Penguin 4 was announced on September 23 (which started to roll out before the announcement date). And if you’re thinking, “Would Google really roll out multiple algorithm updates at one time?,” the answer is YES. They have done this several times before. My favorite was the algorithm sandwich in April of 2012, when Google rolled out Panda, then Penguin 1.0, and then Panda again, all within 10 days. But again, I saw many sites impacted by the August 31 update that were also impacted by previous quality updates. Here are two sites that were impacted by the early September update with a clear connection to previous quality updates. And I’m not referring to Penguin impact, which seems to have started mid-month. I’m referring to sites without Penguin issues that have been impacted by previous quality updates: I’m planning on covering more about this soon, but I wanted to touch on the September volatility before we hop into this post. Now, back to our regularly scheduled program. Phantom and low-quality user engagement: hell hath no fury like a user scorned After analyzing many sites that either dropped or surged during Google quality updates, I saw many examples of what I’m calling “low-quality user experience” (which could include low-quality content). I’ve helped a lot of companies with Panda since 2011, and there is definitely overlap with some of the problems I surfaced with Phantom. That said, quality updates seem more focused on user experience than content quality. Below, I’ll cover some specific low-quality situations I’ve uncovered while analyzing sites impacted by Phantom. It’s also important to note that there’s usually not just one problem that’s causing a drop from a quality update. There’s typically a combination of problems riddling a website. I can’t remember analyzing a single site that got hit hard that had just one smoking gun. It’s usually a battery of smoking guns working together. That’s important to understand. Quick disclaimer: The list below does not cover every situation I’ve come across. It’s meant to give you a view of several core quality problems I’ve seen while analyzing sites impacted by Google’s quality updates. I cannot tell you for sure which problems are direct factors, which ones indirectly impact a site and which ones aren’t even taken into account. And again, it’s often a combination of problems that led to negative impact. Personally, I believe Google can identify barriers to usability and the negative impact those barriers have on user engagement. And as I’ve always said, user happiness typically wins. Don’t frustrate users, force them a certain way, push ads on them, make them jump through hoops to accomplish a task and so forth. One thing is for sure: I came across many, many sites during my Phantom travels that had serious quality problems (which included a number of the items I’m listing below). Let’s get started. Clumsy and frustrating user experience I’ve seen many sites that were impacted negatively that employed a clumsy and frustrating user experience (UX). For example, I’ve looked at websites where the main content and supplementary content were completely disorganized, making it extremely hard to traverse pages within the site. Mind you, I’m using two large monitors working in tandem — imagine what a typical user would experience on a laptop, tablet, or even their phone! I have also come across a number of situations where the user interface (UI) was breaking, the content was being blocked by user interface modules, and more. This can be extremely frustrating for users, as they can’t actually read all of the content on the page, can’t use the navigation in some areas and so on. Taking a frustrating experience to another level, I’ve also analyzed situations where the site would block the user experience. For example, blocking the use of the back button in the browser, or identifying when users were moving to that area of the browser and then presenting a popup with the goal of getting those users to remain on the site. To me, you’re adding fuel to a fire when you take control of someone’s browser (or inhibit the use of their browser’s functionality). And you also increase the level of creepiness when showing that you are tracking their mouse movements! I highly recommend not doing this. Aggressive advertising Then there were times ads were so prominent and aggressive that the main content was pushed down the page or squeezed into small areas of the page. And, in worst-case scenarios, I actually had a hard time finding the main content at all. Again, think about the horrible signals users could be sending Google after experiencing something like that. Content rendering problems  There were some sites I analyzed that were unknowingly having major problems with how Google rendered their content. For example, everything looked fine for users, but Google’s “fetch and render” tool revealed dangerous problems. That included giant popups in the render of every page of the site (hiding the main content). I’ve also seen important pieces of content not rendering on desktop or mobile — and in worst-case scenarios, no content rendered at all. Needless to say, Google is going to have a hard time understanding your content if it can’t see it. Note, John Mueller also addressed this situation in a recent Webmaster Hangout and explained that if Google can’t render the content properly, then it could have a hard time indexing and ranking that content. Again, beware. Deception (ads, affiliate links, etc.) One of the worst problems I’ve come across when analyzing both Panda and Phantom hits relates to ad deception. That’s when ads are woven into the main content and look like the main content. So users believe they are clicking on links that will take them to additional content on the same site, but instead, they are whisked off the site downstream to an advertiser. That could be a shockingly bad user experience for visitors, but the ad deception ride typically doesn’t stop there. Some of those downstream, third-party sites are extremely aggressive content-wise, contain malware, force downloads, and more. So combine deception with danger, and you’ve got a horrible recipe for Mr. Phantom. Again, hell hath no fury like a user scorned. Quick case study: I remember asking a business owner who was negatively impacted by a quality update why a content module in the middle of their pages that contained ads wasn’t marked as sponsored (The ads were deceptive). They said that the click-through rate was so good, they didn’t want to impact their numbers. So basically, they kept deceiving users to maintain ad revenue — not good, to say the least. It’s a prime example of what not to do. In addition, you have to look no further than Google’s Quality Rater Guidelines (QRG) to find specific callouts of ad deception, and how pages that employ that type of deception should be considered low-quality. I find many people still haven’t read Google’s QRG. I highly recommend doing so. You will find many examples of what I’m seeing while analyzing sites impacted by Google’s quality updates. More excessive monetization I also saw additional examples of aggressive monetization during my Phantom travels. For example, forcing users to view 38 pages of pagination in order to read an article (with only one paragraph per page). And of course, the site is feeding several ads per page to increase ad impressions with every click to a new page. Nice. That worked until the sites were algorithmically punched in the face. You can read my post about Panda and aggressive advertising to learn more about that situation. Phantom has a one-two punch as well. Beware. Aggressive popups and interstitials First, yes, I know Google has not officially rolled out the mobile popup algorithm yet. But that will be a direct factor when it rolls out. For now, what I’m saying is that users could be so thrown off by aggressive popups and interstitials that they jump back to the search results quickly (resulting in extremely low dwell time). And as I’ve said a thousand times before, extremely low dwell time (in aggregate) is a strong signal to Google that users did not find what they wanted (or did not enjoy their experience on the site). While analyzing sites negatively impacted by Google’s quality updates, I have seen many examples of sites presenting aggressive popups and other interstitials that completely inhibit the user experience (on both desktop and mobile). For some of the sites, the annoyance levels were through the roof. Now take that frustration and extrapolate it over many users hitting the site, over an extended period of time, and you can see how bad a situation it could be, quality-wise. Then combine this with other low-quality problems, and the ectoplasm levels increase. Not good, to say the least. It’s also important to note that Googlebot could end up seeing the popup as your main content. Yes, that means the amazing content you created will be sitting below the popup, and Googlebot could see that popup as your main content. Here’s a video of Google’s John Mueller explaining that. The core point here is to not inhibit the user experience in any way. And aggressive popups and interstitials can absolutely do that. Beware. Lackluster content not meeting user expectations From a content standpoint, there were many examples of sites dropping off a cliff that contained content that simply couldn’t live up to user expectations. For example, I reviewed sites that were ranking for competitive queries, but the content did not delve deep enough to rank for those queries. (This often involved thin content that had no shot at providing what the user needed.) Does this remind you of another algorithm Google has employed? (Cough, Panda.) Like I said, I’ve seen overlap with Panda during my Phantom travels. As you can guess, many users were probably not happy with the content and jumped back to the search results. As I mentioned earlier, very low dwell time (in aggregate) is a powerful signal to Google that users were not happy with the result. It’s also a giant invitation to Panda and/or Phantom. By the way, dwell time is not the same as bounce rate in Google Analytics. Very low dwell time is someone searching, visiting a page, and then returning to the search results very quickly. I believe Google can understand this by niche — so a coupon site would be much different from a news site, which would be different from an e-commerce site. There are flaws with bounce rate in Google Analytics (and other analytics packages), but that’s for another post. Low-quality supplementary content I also saw many examples of horrible and unhelpful supplementary content. For example, if there’s an article on a specific subject, the supplementary content should be relevant and helpful. It shouldn’t contain a boatload of links to non-relevant content, contain deceptive and cloaked ads and so on. It’s okay to have advertising, but make sure it can easily be identified as such. And help your users find more of your great content. Make sure the links you provide are relevant, helpful, and enhance the user experience. Side note: Phantom eats rich snippets — scary, but true One interesting side note (which I’ve mentioned in my previous posts about Phantom) is that when quality updates have rolled out, sites have gained or lost rich snippets. So it seems the algorithm has something built in that can strip or provide rich snippets. Either that, or Google is updating the rich snippets algorithm at the same time (tied to the quality threshold for displaying rich snippets that Google has mentioned several times). So, not only can quality updates impact rankings, but it seems they can impact SERP treatment, too. Net-net Again, I chose to list several examples of what I’ve seen during my Phantom travels in this post, but I did not cover all of the low-quality situations I’ve seen. There are many! Basically, the combination of strong user experience and high-quality content wins. Always try to exceed user expectations (from both a content standpoint and UX standpoint). Don’t deceive users, and don’t fall into the excessive monetization trap. That includes both desktop and mobile. Remember, hell hath no fury like a user scorned. From what I’ve seen, users have a (new) voice now, and it’s called Phantom. Don’t make it angry. It probably won’t work out very well for you. Exorcising the Phantom: what webmasters can do now If you’ve been impacted by a quality update, or several, what can you do now? Below, I’ll provide some bullets containing important items that you can (and should) start today. And the first is key. If you’ve been impacted negatively, don’t wait. Even Google’s John Mueller has said not to. Check 30:14 in the video. Objectively measure the quality of your site. Go through your site like a typical user would. And if you have a hard time doing this objectively, have others go through your site and provide feedback. You might be surprised by what you surface. Perform a thorough crawl analysis and audit of your site through a quality lens. This is always a great approach that can help surface quality problems. I use both DeepCrawl and Screaming Frog extensively. (Note: I’m on the customer advisory board for DeepCrawl and have been a huge fan of using it for enterprise crawls for years.) Understand the landing pages that have dropped, the queries those pages ranked for, and put yourself in the position of a user arriving from Google after searching for those queries. Does your content meet or exceed expectations? Understand the “annoyance factor.” Popups, excessive pagination, deception, UIs breaking, thin content, user unhappiness and so on. Based upon my analyses, all of these are dangerous elements when it comes to Phantom. Use “fetch and render” in Google Search Console to ensure you aren’t presenting problems to Googlebot. I’ve seen this a number of times with Phantom hits. If Google can’t see your content, it will have a hard time indexing and ranking that content. Fix everything as quickly as you can, check all changes in staging, and then again right after you roll them out to production. Don’t make the situation worse by injecting more problems into your site. I’ve seen his happen, and it’s not pretty. Similar to what I’ve said to Panda victims I have helped over the years, drive forward like you’re not being negatively impacted. Keep building high-quality content, meeting and exceeding user expectations, building new links naturally, building your brand, and more. Fight your way out of the ectoplasm. Remember, Google’s quality updates seem to require a refresh. Don’t give up. Summary: Panda is in stealth mode, Phantom is front and center With Panda now in stealth mode, there’s another algorithm that SEOs need to be aware of. We’ve seen a number of Google Quality Updates (aka Phantom) since May of 2015, and in my opinion, they heavily focus on “low-quality user experience.” I highly recommend reviewing your analytics reporting, understanding if you’ve been impacted, and then forming a plan of attack for maintaining the highest level of quality possible on your website.

It’s a conversational assistant that Google has developed to help users with everything like scheduling their reminders, running web searches, making reservations, and more. Google has said that Assistant will remain exclusive to the Pixel lineup for now but a method has already been discovered to enable Google Assistant on smartphones that are running Android 7.0 Nougat. The XDA Developers forum is a great place for Android modders, they share tips and tweaks there and it was only a matter of time before someone came up with a method to make this happen. XDA user brianelv has posted a guide on how to enable Google Assistant on any smartphone that’s running Android 7.0 Nougat. All they need is version 6.5.35.21 or newer of the Google app. The full guide can be found on the forum, the process isn’t that complicated, you just need to change one file, reboot the phone and then clear the Google app cache. Do keep in mind that a root or custom recovery is required. Once everything is done, switching to the Google Now launcher will bring up the Assistant setup. It’s pretty easy from there. If you happen to have a handset that runs Android 7.0 Nougat, do give it a try if you’re not worried about tinkering a bit with your device. Filed in Cellphones.

That was despite learning that Google had Google Assistant running on a modified Nexus 6P just fine. As you can imagine, the tech community was upset so it went to work. Now the modders over at XDA Developers have done what Google said wouldn’t happen “anytime soon” and they’ve gotten Google Assistant working on the Nexus 6P with no bugs. The change is a simple one, as long as you’re running the stock NBD90X System Image. If you’re not, you’ll need to download and flash it in order to use this on your device. The patch is simple, just replace your build.prop with the one on the link After replacing the build.prop wipe your data. If long pressing the home button stills opens Google Now be sure you have the Google App (Velvet) updated (6.5.35.21 or newer), or wipe your data and try again. If you want to try this yourself, here’s where you can find the information you need and the stock image to try this for yourself. Several people on the forums note that it works well, but after you change the buil.prop the Google Play Store will recognize your device as a Pixel XL instead of a Nexus 6P. OTA updates will also no longer work.

A sense of humor is a distinct feature that sets humans apart from animals. But Google is toeing that line by giving its AI a funny bone. The tech titan is reportedly infusing comedy into its new virtual assistant, according to The Wall Street Journal. Former staffers from Pixar Animation Studios and satirical news service The Onion are now on Google's payroll, making a living writing witty quips for Assistant to spit out. Google did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment. But it tells the Journal that infusing artificial intelligence with a sense of humor require an attention to details like latency ("humans have no patience for it in conversation," the paper notes) and tone of voice. Google Assistant is a platform that will allow users to have "an ongoing, two-way dialog with Google," CEO Sundar Pichai said at I/O. In a demo at its Oct. 4 event, the company used Assistant on the Pixel to buy concert tickets, make a restaurant reservation, and get directions—all by voice. //Related Articles AI Is Helping Pacers Fans Get Their Beer, Nachos Quicker "It can help with the big things like weekend plans, but it's also good for the little things like finding information, setting reminders for yourself, and so much more," Brian Rakowski, vice president of Google Product Management, said last week. Alongside the Pixel smartphone lineup, Assistant will be incorporated into Google Home (pictured)—the search giant's answer to Amazon Echo, expected for release next month.

Reprints Reprints Most Popular Google just debuted a digital assistant, which it hopes to place inside smartphones, watches, cars and every other imaginable internet-connected device. It's already hit a snag. The Alphabet division launched new smartphones last week with the artificially intelligent assistant deeply embedded. It also rolled out a speaker with the feature at its core and announced plans to let other companies tie their apps and services to the assistant. A day later, Samsung, which just announced it was ending production of its problematic Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, said it was acquiring Viv Labs, a startup building its own AI voice-based assistant. At first, the deal looked like a counter-punch to Samsung rival Apple -- Viv is run by the creators of Apple's Siri assistant. But buying Viv may be more of a problem for Google, because Samsung is the biggest maker of phones running Google's Android mobile operating system. Related Stories Watch Out, Siri and Alexa: Google's New Digital Assistant Is Here Google Goes After Apple, Amazon With New Pixel Phone, Smart Home Device Samsung to Kill Off Note 7 After Second Round of Battery Fires Samsung's Profits Continue to Grow Despite Note 7 Recall Amazon Rolls Out Alexa-Based Connectivity in Hyundai's Genesis Google strategy is now centered on the assistant, rather than its search engine, because it's a more natural way for people to interact with smartphones and other connected devices. Getting all Android phone makers to put the Google assistant on their devices would get the technology into millions of hands quickly. But Samsung's Viv deal suggests assistants are too important for phone makers to let other companies supply this feature. Last week, despite the Note 7 crisis, Samsung executive Injong Rhee said the company plans to put Viv's technology in its smartphones next year and then embed it into other electronics and home appliances. A Samsung representative and a Google spokeswoman declined to comment. That's a necessity for Samsung, according to some analysts and industry insiders. "As AI is becoming more sophisticated and valuable to the consumer, there's no question it will be important for hardware companies," said Kirt McMaster, executive chairman of Cyanogen, a startup that makes Android software. Mr. McMaster, a frequent Google critic, said other Android handset makers will likely follow Samsung's move. "If you don't have an AI asset, you're not going to have a brain," he added. Google may already have known that some Android phone makers -- known as original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs -- were reluctant to embrace its assistant. "Other OEMs may want to differentiate" Google's Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer told Bloomberg before it released its own smartphones. "They may want to do their own thing -- their own assistant, for example." Samsung and Google have sparred in the past over distribution. Google requires Android handset makers to pre-install 11 apps, yet Samsung often puts its own services on its phones. And the South Korean company has released devices that run on its own operating system, called Tizen, not Android. Viv was frequently on the short-list of startups that could help larger tech companies build assistant technology. Founded four-years ago by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham, the startup was working on voice technology to handle more complex queries than existing offerings. While it drummed up considerable attention and investment, Viv has not yet released its product to the public. And some analysts are skeptical of Samsung's ability to convert the technology into a credible service, given its mixed record with software applications. "It will be very hard to compete with Google's strength in data and their AI acquisitions," said Jitendra Waral, senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. "Samsung would need to prove that its AI solutions are superior to that of Google's. They are handicapped in this race." Samsung is also focused on handling the fallout from its exploding Galaxy Note 7 phones, potentially taking management time away from its Viv integration. But it's a race Samsung has to join. In recent years, Samsung acquired mobile-payments and connected-device startups to keep up with Apple, Google and Amazon. Digital voice-based assistants may be more important, if they become the main way people interact with devices. Silicon Valley titans are rushing into the space because of this potential. Amazon is trying to sign up developers for its Alexa voice technology. Apple has recently touted more Siri capabilities and opened the technology to other developers. And now Google, considered the leader in artificial intelligence, is making its own push. "I don't ever remember a time when every single major consumer tech company -- and even enterprise companies -- have been singularly focused on an identical strategy," said Tim Tuttle, chief executive officer of MindMeld Inc., a startup working on voice interaction software. "They're all following the exact same playbook." -- Bloomberg News In this article: Consumer Electronics Digital Mobile Technology Telecommunications Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

Now, you can add as many people to your Project Fi plan as you’d like at an additional cost of $15 per user. The rate for data remains $10 per GB, and Google will still issue refunds for unused data. As it stands today, Project Fi works on the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and the newly announced Pixel and Pixel XL and the introductory Basics plan costs $20 a month for unlimited talk and text. Project Fi, launched last year on an invite system for Google’s Nexus phones, became widely available starting in March of this year. It works as a virtual network, borrowing the coverage of T-Mobile, Sprint, US Cellular, and international provider Three to provide internet access for mobile users. It’s biggest draw is a stripped-down pricing scheme that charges users only for the data they use, instead of throttling or charging overage fees as telecoms are prone to do. Google has designed an appropriately no-frills interface for managing these group plans. You’ll be able to add and remove new members easily without activation fees right from the app, as well as monitor data usage for each active participant. At the end of each month, Google issues one bill. Each member can also set personal notifications for data usage, while the manager of the account can set data allowances for each member and temporarily cease service if someone happens to stream too generously from Netflix or Spotify. To urge potential new customers to sign up for Project Fi, Google is offering discounts on its Nexus phones. The Nexus 5X will now come $150 off when you purchase it and activate it through Fi, and the Nexus 6P will get a $100 discount. Both Nexus devices have removed from the general Play Store, but can be found and purchased under the "Phones" section of the Project Fi website. Understandably, Google’s Pixel phones remain at full price. You can buy those devices using standard financing through Verizon or on the Play Store and Project Fi store starting at $649 unlocked or $27/month. Update 1:53PM ET October 11th: Clarified that Google's Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P can only be purchased from the Project Fi website at this point.

Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 just won’t stop exploding, and the company is now telling users to turn off their phones indefinitely as it looks to end production of the device. As the final nail enters the coffin, here are some of the hottest Galaxy Note 7 alternatives to consider instead. 1) Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Amazon.com Price: Buy Now for $599 Our Score: 4.5/5 Our Verdict: "Best-in-class camera, design and performance make the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge the Android phone to beat in 2016." The most obvious choice is the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. It’s a little smaller, pitting a 5.5-inch display against the Galaxy Note 7’s 5.7-incher, but the hardware is almost identical. You get the same screen resolution, same powerful processor, same excellent camera, and most of the perks such as wireless charging and the always-on display. All you’ll miss out on is the iris scanner and the stylus, neither of which can truthfully be called essentials. Why switch? If you’re looking for a Galaxy Note 7 alternative, this will give you the most similar experience, and for less money too.

The new iPhone 7 Plus is a formidable handset, and comes equipped with iOS 10. There’s no questioning the iPhone’s performance, and although we’ve had some issues with battery life, it’s fair to say that Apple’s upsized flagship is a respectable rival to the Galaxy Note 7. Why switch? If you’re comfortable moving to iOS, you’ll enjoy excellent design and solid performance – albeit for a heftier price. Watch: iPhone 7 Plus vs iPhone 7 3) Google Pixel XL Google Store Price: Buy now for £719 Our Score: TBD Our Verdict: TBD Google wants the new Pixel XL to showcase its vision for Android, but in a larger handset format. The biggest advantages of the Pixel XL include Android 7.0 Nougat and support for Google’s Daydream VR platform, but you’re also getting a solidly built phone with the guarantee of regular software updates. It’s also worth remembering that the Pixel phones come equipped with Qualcomm’s top-end Snapdragon 821 chip, which is a step up from the processor on board the Galaxy Note 7. Why switch? If you’re looking for Google’s software in its purest form, and you want the most cutting-edge Android features, the Pixel XL will have you covered – and it’s got top-of-the-range hardware to boot. You just have to look past the price tag. Watch: Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on 4) OnePlus 3 Amazon.com Price: Buy Now for $500 Our Score: 4.5/5 Our Verdict: “OnePlus has done it again, delivering a superb smartphone to rival the high-end competition at a bargain price." It’s no secret that the OnePlus 3 offers stunningly good value for money, undercutting most of the major smartphone manufacturers without significant compromises to the hardware. You’ll have to settle for a less impressive camera, and you’ll lose quirky features like Samsung’s S Pen stylus, but there’s no questioning the OnePlus 3’s ability to function as your daily driver. Why switch? If you want a flagship-grade smartphone without having to plunder your savings, the OnePlus 3 is a very attractive choice. Best Deals for OnePlus 3 Compare plans Related: OnePlus 3 vs Galaxy Note 7 5) Huawei P9 Plus Amazon.com Price: Buy Now for $630 Our Score: 4/5 Our Verdict: "Great battery life, good screen and a feature-packed camera continue Huawei's strong run." The Huawei P9 Plus is a little smaller than the Galaxy Note 7, featuring a still-respectable 5.5-inch Full HD display. But it has some unique perks, such as a Leica-built dual-camera setup and Huawei’s custom-built Kirin 955 CPU. It’s also got the usual flagship trimmings, featuring 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Why switch? Huawei may not be the first name you think of when it comes to flagship smartphones, but it’s one of the biggest handset makers on the planet. For an Android flagship with great specs, the Huawei P9 Plus is no bad pick. Best Deals for Huawei P9 Plus 6) Samsung Galaxy S8 Amazon UK Price: N/A Our Score: N/A Our Verdict: N/A “Wait, this isn’t even out yet,” I hear you cry. Well, you’re right. In fact, Samsung hasn’t even announced the Galaxy S8, so there’s no guarantee it will ever exist. But it probably will, and it will probably be announced in late February or early March next year. The launch will be here in no time, and you can be sure that Samsung will want to impress with its first post-Note 7 flagship. If the über-successful Galaxy S7 is anything to go by, the Galaxy S8 will be one of the most impressive smartphones of 2017. Why switch? Samsung is likely to go all-out with the Galaxy S8, and will probably kit it out with next-gen components like the Snapdragon 830 chip. If you’re willing to wait, the Galaxy S8 could make it worth your while. Watch: Galaxy S8 news and rumours What's your favourite Galaxy Note 7 alternative? Let us know in the comments below.

Now is a good time for Samsung to give Note 4 owners loads of reasons to hang fire for a season. Reasons like Nougat, themes, Goodlock, the latest Touchwiz, maybe even some accessories.

Google’s Project Fi gets a group plan Posted Oct 11, 2016 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Facebook is about to learn that the enterprise is a different animal Project Fi, Google’s wireless service, is getting a group plan today. While most cell services let you choose a “family plan,” which typically entails the ability to include additional lines at a discount, Fi didn’t yet offer this option. Like you would expect from Fi, it’s all pretty straightforward — but don’t expect to get a massive discount. Project Fi’s group plan lets you add up to five additional lines for $15/month each. That’s a $5 discount from the typical $20 base price you pay for a Project Fi account. Just like Google’s individual plans, you then pay an additional $10/GB for any data you use (and you get a refund if you end up with unused data). Unlike some other carriers, Google doesn’t even pretend that this is only a feature for families. Instead, it clearly notes that you can add “friends from college or your family.” You can also easily add new users or drop them (once you graduate, drift apart and stop being friends with them, for example). The Google Fi app now also lets you set quotas for different users and manage these additional accounts. Given that you’re only getting a $5 discount for adding lines, this feature will likely appeal to families, though — simply because it allows you to set quotas and limits for your children. Otherwise, saving $5 per month is probably not worth the effort for most people. With the launch of the new Pixel phones, Google removed the Nexus 6P and 5X from its main online store. That seemingly left the rather pricey Pixel and Pixel XL as your only options for using Project Fi if you didn’t own one of those cheaper phones already. But here is an interesting twist: You can still buy them if you sign up for Project Fi — and you can even get them on Google’s new interest-free installment plans, too. The 6P is currently available with a $100 discount and the 5X is $150 off. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Project Fi Description Project Fi is Google's wireless service.

Google is running home page ads pushing people to get registered to vote Posted Oct 11, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Requiem for a phablet — a timeline of the rise and fall of the Galaxy Note 7 Google is upping its efforts at getting its U.S. users registered to vote, via a pop-up ad that now appears directly on the desktop home page. The company has historically made an effort to help web users get registered to vote and find answers to their voting-related questions by placing instant answers in its Search results. That has continued this year, as voter searches were redirected to answers about the registration process, deadlines, poll hours and more. However, adding a pop-up on the home page is a much more forceful effort on the search giant’s part in terms of increasing the number of registered voters. Before the ad, voter registration information in the search results was only triggered by searches for related keywords — like “how to vote” or “register to vote,” for example. That means the information was being presented only to those who’ve already decided to at least investigate the voter registration process, or who are perhaps preparing to register in the near future. The pop-ad ad, meanwhile, commands the attention of anyone who visits Google.com in the U.S. That’s a lot of people — according to comScore, Google sites account for 64 percent of the desktop search share, and see more than 10 billion searches per month. The ad doesn’t appear with every search query, it seems. But it will, on occasion, pop up and remain in the bottom-right corner of the home page. The ad’s text reads “Make sure you’re ready to vote” and offers a link to “Register now.” You can dismiss the ad by clicking the “NO THANKS” button, but the more prominent blue button instead encourages a further click to “LEARN HOW.” This will take you to the voter registration information Google has already gathered. (Since this summer, Google has been steadily rolling out registration information, voting information and even voting information in Spanish in its search results.) It’s fairly rare for Google to utilize its home page in support of a cause. Typically, the Google home page remains the blank, clean slate with the logo and search box that serves as millions of people’s jumping off point to the web. Over the years, Google has been hesitant to clutter it with extraneous information. However, at times, the company has pushed its own products and services on the home page, through small links. For example, in the past we’ve seen links for Android smartphones or Google+.  More recently, the home page has sported pop-up ads that encourage users to sign up for AdWords — something indicative of how critical the ad business is to the company as more of consumers’ internet activity shifts to mobile and apps. These ads, too, appear as pop-ups. the @google homepage reminding everyone in Texas that today is the last day to register to vote. Nicely done! pic.twitter.com/T2swh3prgT — Sara Robertson (@bonitasarita) October 11, 2016 In the case of the voter registration push, however, Google isn’t limiting itself to the pop-up nag — it has also begun to alert users in various states when it’s the last day to get registered. These informational messages appear at the bottom of the search page. Google isn’t the only web company involved in a voter registration push, of course — Google-owned YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and others are involved in similar efforts. The companies’ goals are simple: Getting more people registered means more people will actually vote, studies have shown. For instance, 86 percent of registered voters also voted in the November 2012 election, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, as Google had previously noted. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Whether it’s acting awkward at the mention of a dirty word or delivering a quip when given a compliment, AI like Siri, Cortana, and Alexa are already capable of engaging in something resembling a conversation, but Google is looking to take that one step further with Google Assistant. According to a Wall Street Journal write-up, Google has brought in writers from Pixar and The Onion to work on Google Assistant. Their job? Give the Assistant a personality that stands out from the rest. Obviously, Google Assistant won’t be able to understand and hold an actual conversation since it isn’t true artificial intelligence, but with some crafty writing and Google’s immense search database, the company stands a pretty good shot at turning Assistant into something that people want to talk to. Since Google Assistant is a fairly big cornerstone of the company’s incoming Pixel phones, that could be a big deal. If these writers can infuse Assistant with a deeper understanding of things like inflection and humor, that could go a long way toward encouraging a more personal connection with Assistant, even though the fact remains that at the end of the day, it’s just another machine delivering scripted responses to user queries. It’ll be interesting how users interact with Google Assistant, which is also at the center of Google Home. Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL phones will be launching later this month, and both devices will be available from Verizon stores and through Google’s online store.

We might be used to Siri's bad jokes on our iPhones or messing with Amazon’s Alexa. And recently an AI robot Sophia tried out a pickup line on Charlie Rose on 60 Minutes last week. Now Google has joined the trend of human-like artificial intelligence to make AI a little more fun. Its new assistant was developed in part by comedy writers from Pixar and The Onion, the satirical newspaper that is sometimes just too honest for these crazy times we live in, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Onion's satirical headlines can be pure gold. Image: hildgrim/Flickr Pixel, Google's new phone, on sale at stores October 21, will be the first device to feature this AI. It will also be the voice of Google Home, a “glorified speaker with an embedded personal speaker”, as Motherboard’s Ben Sullivan recently reported. The idea behind hiring comedy writers is to "infuse personality" into the AI voice assistant, said Gummi Hafsteinsson, product manager of Google Home. The eventual goal is for the user to feel emotionally connected to the assistant. Before we know it, AI will be taking over for our dating lives, too. As humans and AI become closer and AI more a part of our lives—Google aims to get their AI on all connected devices within hearing range—humor is an important part of allowing people to interact more naturally with their automated assistants.

Despite a slow start, in the five years since these laptops have become a much more viable proposition – so what's happened? In today's computing climate the idea of a computer based around a browser doesn't seem quite so bizarre as it once did. It was almost as if Google knew what was coming down the line (perhaps it did) and made a laptop to match. When they first appeared though, the list of complaints was lengthy. So-so specs. No local storage. No desktop applications. A complete reliance on the web and very little offline support. Here are the main reasons those problems matter a lot less in 2016. The internet is available (almost) everywhere It's easy to take Wi-Fi access for granted these days. If you're too young to remember the time when even setting up a wireless network in your own home with broadband you'd already paid for was a tricky proposition, consider yourself lucky. Average internet speeds have gotten a lot faster in the last half decade, and internet access itself has become more ubiquitous, covering coffee shops, hotels, planes and all kinds of private and public hotspots. If you think about it, there aren't that many places left where you can sit down and open a laptop and don't have at least a few Wi-Fi options to pick from (in developed, urban parts of the world anyway), even if some of them involve coughing up a fee. That's partly because the infrastructure is improving, partly because we're all now carrying data-hungry smartphones, and partly because of the demand for streaming services like Netflix and Spotify (and trying to sell someone on a Chromebook when the whole of the world's recorded music is stored in the cloud is a lot easier). Yes, there are places where getting online is difficult, but the situation is a lot better than it used to be, and it's only going to improve from here on in. Indeed, that's part of the reason why Netflix has so far refused to offer an offline mode to its users. Web apps are better – and work offline One of the original problems with relying solely on web apps was that as soon as your connection went, your Chromebook became just a very expensive paperweight. That situation has changed dramatically too, with Google leading the way. Google Drive and its online office suite can now work perfectly happily without a web connection. You can create and edit files, with all the changes getting synced back to the cloud as soon as a connection is restored. That means with Google Docs' offline support you can use a Chromebook to go and write a novel in a cabin in the woods. You just won't be able to look up any background facts while you're there. Unlike Netflix, Google Play Movies does offer downloads for offline viewing, and you do get a few gigabytes of local storage on Chromebooks if it's media files you're interested in (there's always the USB stick or external hard drive option too). Of course you'll still come across a lot of web apps that break when there's no Wi-Fi available, but like Wi-Fi access itself, the trend is in the right direction. With or without internet access, these online apps are becoming more powerful and feature-rich, like the online versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint now offered by Microsoft. Even Apple is getting in on the act, adding features year-on-year to its iCloud offering. We're still a long way from getting iTunes through a web browser, but there are already some decent Photoshop alternatives if you can live without the most advanced features. Android apps are coming Greater Wi-Fi coverage, better apps, and better offline support would be great reasons in themselves why Chromebooks are more appealing than ever, but on top of all that there's the recent introduction of Android apps to Chrome OS. Whether or not Google ever merges these two operating systems together, putting the Google Play Store on Chromebooks is a clever move. It increases the offline capabilities of the devices for a start, because a lot of apps can use local storage. It also opens up more possibilities for apps that feel like native, desktop tools, such as the Microsoft Office apps for Android, for instance. It's an opportunity to install a whole new pile of games too, in addition to those already available in the browser. It's no coincidence that the first Chromebooks to support the Play Store have touchscreens, giving users another way (and a very natural way) to interact with Android apps running in windows on Chrome OS. Full-scale web apps combined with all the variety of the Android app store really is the best of both worlds. The original Chromebook advantages still stand One trending point of view when Chromebooks came out went like this: Why buy a laptop that's just the Chrome browser, when for a little extra you can buy a Windows or Mac machine that's the Chrome browser and so much more? What that perspective misses is that sometimes less is more. Not everyone wants to have to deal with antivirus programs, OS updates, desktop applications and regular backups. In fact, it's probably fewer people than ever that are willing to trade the extra hassle for the extra capabilities. Google's very first Chrome OS adverts focused on the benefits of a laptop that never slowed down and never needed updating – one that you could drop in a river without losing a single document, email or photo. A lot of people are now growing up with the idea that when you move from device to device, everything moves seamlessly with you. Are Chromebooks for everyone? Absolutely not. Are Windows and Mac laptops more versatile and powerful? Of course. But for a growing number of people who spend all their time in a web browser anyway, Chromebooks make a lot of sense – particularly with the added bonus of Android app support.View gallery - 3 images New AtlasWhy Google's Chromebooks make more sense than ever 1 / 3 Tags #Chromebook #Google #Chrome OS Share this article Show 5 comments Recomended for you Latest in Laptops 15-inch MacBook Pro: 2016 vs. 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro vs. 12-inch MacBook (2016) 13-inch MacBook Pro (2016) vs. MacBook Air 13-inch MacBook Pro (2016) vs. Microsoft Surface Book Search New Atlas Search (optional) Over 255,000 people receive our email newsletter See the stories that matter in your inbox every morning Email address unused Gizmag is now New Atlas Switch to Desktop Site

The firm expects the company's results to be broadly in line, with Cloud providing a potential upside surprise versus the consensus. Cloud: A Bright Spot Analyst Ross Sandler believes the company could grow through its tougher comps in the second half, as now more than half of its queries are mobile and monetization continues to ramp. The analyst noted that the Google's Cloud business is likely to benefit from rapid growth off a low base and an easy comp. Accordingly, the analyst believes 40+ percent revenue growth, well above the ad business. 3Q Revenue Upside Likely Deutsche Bank's checks point to solid traction among some of the new Adwords features like ETAs, Customer Match, cross-device and device independent bidding. The firm sees small upside to its $15.8 billion revenue estimate and a 100 basis point improvement in core margin yet again. EPS upside if at all, according to the firm, will be driven by some rationalizing the "other bets" cost structure. The firm estimates GAAP earnings per share of $6.81. Related Link: Samsung's AI Strategy Poses Problems For Google Mobile Queries, Cloud, AI-ML: Triple Boost Having crossed the 50 percent of queries in mobile, the firm believes Google will benefit from above-trendline growth at sites, excluding forex, for the next several quarters. If Cloud performs as expected in the third quarter, the firm believes the company's Google Cloud Platform would start improving and potentially be a second act on top of advertising over the coming years. Additionally, the firm believes the Street is underestimating the ability of AI and Machine Learning in driving engagement for many Google products. $1,000 Target Not Far Fetched Concluding, Deutsche Bank said multiple expansion is unlikely, although out-year earnings per share boost of potentially $5 to $10 due to possible reduction in losses at Other Bests could take shares up to $1,000. The firm has a Buy rating and a $1,050 price target on the shares of the company. At last check, shares of Alphabet (GOOG) were down 0.07 percent at $785.41, while GOOGL shares were down by the same percentage, trading at $813.62. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

By Jing CaoBloomberg Tues., Oct. 11, 2016 Samsung Electronics Co.’s mounting crisis with its flagship Galaxy Note 7 has left millions of premium smartphone buyers looking for an alternative. The obvious candidate is Apple’s iPhone 7, but Google’s slick new Pixel device could get a lift, too. Samsung recalled and pledged to replace millions of Note 7 phones in early September after reports that their batteries were bursting into flame. But over the past week, new reports have emerged that some replacement phones are catching on fire, too. Samsung has now asked retailers to stop selling all Note 7 phones while the company and U.S. officials investigate why the new batch of devices seem to be afflicted with the same problem. Many people upgrade their phones during the Christmas shopping season, giving Apple and Google an opportunity to fill the Samsung vacuum — and making it even harder for the South Korean company to bounce back. The Pixel may be especially appealing to Samsung users looking for another device that runs the Android operating system. “There’s been a shift toward bigger screen devices, and there’s less competition there given the Note 7 issue, so there’s definitely more opportunities for the iPhone 7 Plus,” said James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP. As for Google, “the Pixel suddenly has got very limited competition at the high end of the market.” Samsung on Tuesday asked wireless carriers to stop selling its most expensive phone and instructed consumers to stop using them. The move came as carriers including AT&T Inc., T-Mobile US Inc., Sprint Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and Australia’s Telstra Corp. halted Note 7 sales following reports of problems with devices thought to be safe. Article Continued Below Before the exploding batteries, Samsung had defied a slowing smartphone market with better-than expected Galaxy sales and successfully capitalized on a lull in demand for new iPhones. In recent months, Samsung had expanded its already considerable market share. The company shipped 77 million smartphones in the second quarter for a market share of 22 per cent, that’s up from 73 million, or 21 per cent share a year ago, according to IDC. Apple’s shipments dropped 15 per cent to leave it with market share of 12 per cent.   Samsung on Tuesday asked wireless carriers to stop selling its most expensive phone and instructed consumers to stop using them due to the fire risk.  (DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS / AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   Now the South Korean company enters the crucial holiday shopping season with no large-screen smartphone. Because Samsung and Apple have basically split the market for $700-plus smartphones between them, the latter is a natural beneficiary of Samsung’s woes. Investors seem to expect that to happen and pushed Apple shares up 1.7 per cent to $116.05 Monday in New York, the highest level since December 2015. In the long-term, Apple could attract Android users to its “sticky iOS ecosystem, which boasts a ~95 per cent loyalty rate,” Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Kulbinder Garcha wrote in a note. Still, Google’s Pixel, which debuts in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada and Germany on Oct. 20, could appeal to those who are immune to Apple’s charms. The Pixel is the first phone the search giant has conceptualized, designed, engineered and tested in-house. It has a number of features that will be broadly appealing, including a Siri-like virtual assistant, a flashy camera and speedy apps. Of course, the Pixel is untested, Google’s previous forays into hardware have floundered, and the company lacks its own retail stores. How much Apple and Google benefit depends on what Samsung does next. Already pressure is mounting for the company to kill its troubled phone altogether. Said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. in Seoul: “It’s meaningless to continue producing the Note 7.” Read more about: Apple, Google, Samsung The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Google Assistant Can Be Enabled on Rooted Android Nougat Devices The smartphones need to run Android 7.0 Nougat Oct 11, 2016 14:19 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google unveiled its latest smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, last week and the company announced that Google Assistant would be exclusively available on the two phones for now. The AI assistant does come with multiple advantages over Google Now and has lots of neat features. Google Assistant can be used for performing online searches, managing your schedule, finding interesting information, places, checking the weather, and more. Recently, the WSJ reported that Google has paid comedy writers to provide jokes for the virtual assistant. Apparently, Google Assistant will have jokes created by the writers of Pixar movies and satire site The Onion. The AI assistant is only available on Pixel phones but folks from XDA Developers (via PhoneArena) have found a way to enable it on other smartphones as well. Apparently, you would need to simply edit the build.prop file. First of all, you need a rooted device that runs Android 7.0 and the latest Google app installed (version 6.5.35.21).  Find the build.prop file on your smartphone and add the following line "ro.opa.eligible_device=true", (without the quotes of course). Once you’ve done that, you need to apply changes to the file, wipe the cache and the data from the Google application, and reboot the phone. A second reboot might be needed if changes don’t apply right away. However, there’s a slight chance that the method won’t work on your smartphone, so don’t get your hopes up. Also, bear in mind that changes to a phone’s build.prop file can result in some issues. #Google#Google Assistant#Pixel#Pixel XL#Android 7.0 Nougat reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Duo to Replace Hangouts as the Main Video-Chatting App for Android Phones Google Pixel and Pixel XL Phones Will Work on Republic Wireless Network Google Project Tango Phone, the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, to Arrive in November Pixel Smartphones Offered with $100 Gift Card at Best Buy 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon    Google Assistant New Android APKs Navbar Apps APK: Updated November 13th, 17:48 GMT MiXplorer APK: Updated November 13th, 17:46 GMT Periscope APK: Updated November 13th, 17:43 GMT XDA Labs APK: Updated November 13th, 17:38 GMT Game Tools APK: Updated November 13th, 17:35 GMT SoundHound APK: Updated November 13th, 17:33 GMT Microsoft Classroom APK: Updated November 13th, 17:17 GMT Reader comments Samsung Already Capable of Mass Producing Foldable Smartphones but It's Cautious more on: Samsung foldable phone i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The product, called Workplace, looks very much like the consumer version of Facebook, with a news feed and a chat app, but there’s a fee to use it. Still, at less than half the price of its closest competitors, Workplace’s fee is an aggressive move that could shake up some of the sector’s established players. Service Fee* (per user per month) Workplace $3 Slack $6.67 Yammer** $8 Hangouts** $5 *Lowest paid tier **Part of a larger software package Workplace is most like Slack, the messaging platform for companies that is valued at $3.8 billion. Price-wise, an apples-to-apples comparison is tricky: Slack charges a higher fee and offers more features, like additional storage, but Workplace lowers its rate according to the size of the organization. There’s a version of Slack available for free, and of course Facebook’s ad-supported consumer version is also free. Slack’s cheapest paid tier, at $6.67 per user per month, has features comparable to Workplace, including extra attention from customer support and customizable groups for users. Workplace’s other competitors are bundles of products from Microsoft and Google. Microsoft’s Yammer chat app, for instance, is part of its Office 365 package, which includes things like Excel and Word. Google’s Hangouts is included with its larger G Suite range of documents, spreadsheets, and storage offerings. Workplace is cheaper, but it doesn’t provide all the functions these larger software portfolios offer. (Facebook) That’s probably why Facebook has cannily partnered with Microsoft and Google by having their products integrate with Workplace at launch. The plan, for now at least, appears to be for Workplace to complement, rather than replace, these corporate software programs. Facebook is also playing nice in another way. It’s trying to generate network effects by signing on a handful of companies as strategic partners. These firms have vendors, clients, and all manner of other corporate relationships. The more people using Workplace, Facebook’s argument goes, the smoother the work will go. (Facebook) The major strength of Workplace is how familiar users already are with Facebook. It’s almost impossible to tell Workplace apart from the consumer version of Facebook (it even comes with Facebook Live, pictured above). This will serve it well, as it’s targeting a broader spectrum of workers than its competitors, who tend to go after office workers. “No training needed,” said Julian Codorniu, the executive in charge of the product, at a launch event in London yesterday. “It’s for everyone: from factory workers, to baristas in the coffeeshop, to the CEO.” Workplace’s strategy may be working. The advertising agency TBWA has used Workplace for months during the program’s beta phase. Its vice president for Europe, Nicolas Bordas, said during a discussion at the launch event that when an initial batch of 800 workers were invited to join Workplace, half signed up within two hours. “It’s a game-changer,” he said. Over a thousand companies currently use Workplace, with the largest number of users located in India, according to Codorniu. Facebook has given Workplace much thought. It has been tested in private for 18 months, with engineers introducing new features and tweaking existing ones based on feedback. The whole thing was developed in Facebook’s London office, which doubled its engineering headcount to over 400 in 2015. Those engineers, and a staff of over 260 sales and marketing people, cost the company over £165 million ($202 million) for the year. That could well pay off. The rewards of getting Workplace right could be huge, even for a firm like Facebook, which made nearly $18 billion in revenue last year. A rough gauge might be to consider what its competitors are worth: Slack raised its last round of funding at a $3.8 billion value, while Yammer was acquired by Microsoft for $1.2 billion. Microsoft is also finalizing its purchase of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion, with plans to draw it into its Office suite of business tools. The social networking giant Tencent has also launched a corporate version (paywall) of its WeChat messenger. With numbers like that in play, Workplace could end up being a sleeper hit on the scale of Amazon’s cloud computing service. Office chat might not sound particularly exciting, but it wouldn’t be the first time a bland, enterprise software offering became a multi-billion dollar businesses.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Samsung ArtPC Pulse wants to make a statement by Eric Frederiksen  9:00 AM on October 11, 2016 Sometime in the last few years, all the big hardware and data companies out there must've had a secret meeting, because it seems like everyone wants to put a light-up cylinder in our homes. Companies like Amazon and Google have simple assistants like Alexa and Google Home in small devices. Apple's Mac Pro and HP's Pavillion Wave pack full computers into cylinders. Even smaller vendors like MSI has joined the fray with its Vortex. Now, Samsung is getting into the cylinder game with the ArtPC Pulse, a subwoofer and bug-zapper lookalike intended to meet all your modern computing needs. While some of the aforementioned devices were ostensibly designed with the intent of blending into a room and minimizing the visual impact of having a PC, it seems like Samsung's ArtPC Pulse goes for the opposite effect. Whereas the HP Pavillion Wave is wrapped in fabric to make it look like a piece of furniture, Samsung's device is a sleek gunmetal grey cylinder that glows, thanks to its ambient blue LED lighting. Like the Wave, though, it acts not just as a computer but as a speaker as well, with sound provided by audio company Harman Kardon. Amazon's pre-order page advertises expansion modules for the ArtPC, including a 1TB HDD module. None of the modules are pictured in the Amazon listing, and Samsung doesn't have a product page for the ArtPC yet (the company is likely busy with other stuff right now). We're not quite sure how the modules will attach or what modules will be available, apart from the HDD. The ArtPC comes in two equally grey-and-blue flavors. The lower-power model includes a Core i5 CPU clocked at 2.7 GHz CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 256GB SSD. The more expensive version of the ArtPC Pulse packs a Core i7 CPU clocked at 2.4GHz, 16GB of RAM, and a dual-storage setup with a 256GB SSD and a 1TB HDD. Graphics horsepower in both comes by way of AMD's RX 460 graphics card with 2GB of VRAM. The ArtPC Pulse appears to be cut from the same cloth as the Wave—minus the Wave's literal cloth covering. Both are consumer-oriented systems meant for those who want their PC to take up as little space and with as little clutter as possible, and who aren't worried about upgrading it later on. The cheaper model is up for pre-order at $1,200, while the more powerful one clocks in at $1,600. Both models are set to release on October 28.   Tags: Systems Register | Remember me View options x Subscriber options: E-mail me when people reply to my comments Comment sorting order: Flat, chronologicalNo threading.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us New Google Pixel phones use electronic image stabilization over OIS By R Padla - October 11, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Electronic image stabilization (EIS) is an improved technology in mobile imaging. Not many OEMs are using it over optical image stabilization (OIS) but there are those like Google who has already tried to include the feature in the previous Nexus 5X but it must be enabled. The Nexus 6P already has it by default. Other Android devices have it too like the LG V20 and LG V10. Action cameras like the Xiaomi Yi 4K action camera and GoPro HERO5 also boast of EIS. The new Google Pixel and Pixel XL have this feature but people are asking why the company chose the electronic image stabilization(EIS) over optical image stabilization (OIS). Is it any better? Several questions were raised at the Pixel User Community Google forum and two responses from one person can be considered the ‘best answers’. A certain IsaacOnCamera explained that you really cannot compare the two because they have different goals. EIS is more for video while OIS is for photos. The latter also enhances low light photography, compensating for the hand shake. Its goal is to allow longer exposures in low light. Its size makes it a challenge to include in a Pixel while EIS is smaller, therefore, the best choice for the Google-branded smartphone. The OIS module allows a smartphone to perform even in low-light conditions and it actually works well with HDR+ and other software algorithms of the Pixel according to IsaacOnCamera. He further added that EIS on 4K is now supported on the Pixel. The Nexus 6P has the same EIS feature but it doesn’t support 4K yet so this is an improvement.

Korean Antitrust Agency to Examine Google’s Android Agreements GO The agency will examine anti-competition issues involving Google Oct 11, 2016 13:30 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  The head of South Korea’s antitrust regulator has announced that the agency will start examining whether Google’s agreements with smartphone manufacturers are limiting market competition. The agency intends to investigate anti-competition issues.   Jeong Jae-chan, chairman of the Korea Fair Trade Commission, has said the agency will examine any anti-competition issues that Google’s policies could cause on the Android platform, according to Reuters. Earlier this year, the agency said that it was investigating whether the US tech giant violated any South Korean anti-competition laws. However, no information was provided on potential charges that could be brought against Google. Google is under investigation in Europe as well In April this year, we reported that the EU competition enforcer accused Google of demanding mobile phone makers to pre-install Google Search and Google Chrome browser on smartphones so that they would get access to Google apps. The Mountain View-based company is even suspected of providing manufacturers and mobile operators with financial incentives to exclusively pre-install Google Search on their devices. The EU Commission brought three charges to the US company, one involving the company favoring its own shopping service over those provided by rivals. The second charge involved the company’s action to restrict competitors to its AdSense for Search advertising service by signing agreements with websites. Google is risking fines that could reach to billions of dollars in Europe, and since the company is being investigated in South Korea as well, Google may be forced to pay top-dollar to regulators this year. Earlier this year Google received a $6.75 million fine over Android antitrust violations in Russia. It seems that the company had requested smartphone and tablet manufacturers to install Search, Maps and other services as part of the Play Store package. It remains to be seen how the tech company will be handling the investigation in South Korea, but it’s safe to say that this won’t be an easy year for its lawyers. #Google#Antitrust violations#Anti-competition issues#Play Store#Android subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Already Spent $3.2 Million on Advertisement for its Pixel Smartphones Google Officially Unveils Pixel and Pixel XL, Prices Start at $649 Google Play Rolls Out 10-Minute Free Trial Feature for Games and Apps EU May Fine Google for Anti-Competitive Practices on Android 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android Ubuntu Touch OTA-14 Slightly Delayed, New Task Manager Gets Fuzzy Background    Google logo New Android APKs Navbar Apps APK: Updated November 13th, 17:48 GMT MiXplorer APK: Updated November 13th, 17:46 GMT Periscope APK: Updated November 13th, 17:43 GMT XDA Labs APK: Updated November 13th, 17:38 GMT Game Tools APK: Updated November 13th, 17:35 GMT SoundHound APK: Updated November 13th, 17:33 GMT Microsoft Classroom APK: Updated November 13th, 17:17 GMT Reader comments LG G5 Starts Receiving Android 7.0 Nougat Update more on: LG G5 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Editorial Note This article is in the Product Showcase section for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers. There’s no doubt that you – like everyone else – want websites to load fast. It is no wonder that Google, which has an Alexa ranking of 1, has such a light homepage. Using an in-home WiFi network the site measured 66.7KB of content with 672ms load time. Still, not all websites can act like Google. There are many factors that could impact it, especially if your business requires compelling visuals to attract users. Consider the AirBNB homepage: It opens with a cool video at the top of the page and shows great images below from leading cities around the world, which, no doubt, put you in the mood to travel. But with images and videos like this on your site, you face a challenge optimizing the page weight and minimizing load time. Motivation According to Google and Yahoo, acceptable page load time is clearly defined. If your page loads in 2 seconds or under it’s great, 5 seconds is acceptable and longer is too slow. Page load time factors in to the site’s SEO rank. If you are in the e-commerce business, speed is critical. The Aberdeen Group has shown that a 1 second delay in page response can result in a 7 percent reduction in conversions. Considering that images cause the biggest impact on load time – taking in an average 63 percent of delivered bytes1 – let’s focus on them first. Here we’ll show you how to optimize web site image delivery using Cloudinary, a cloud-based service image and video management service. Requirements Cloudinary publish SDKs in several languages. The code samples provided here are in Node.js. Other options are listed here. In case your development language isn’t there, Cloudinary supports the option of uploading images using a direct HTTP call to the API, which is explained here. Image manipulation and delivery also can be implemented by providing the transformation parameters as part of the URL directly. Installation Open a free Cloudinary account. Go to http://www.cloudinary.com/, click "sign up for free" and fill out the registration form. At this point, you can change your default cloud name to your preferred name. In these examples, my cloud name is "cld-name." Install the Cloudinary npm >npm install cloudinary (available at https://npmjs.org/package/cloudinary) Include Cloudinary's Node.js classes in your code var cloudinary = require('cloudinary'); Set your Cloudinary account parameters Your cloud_name account parameter is required to build image URLs. api_key and api_secret parameters are needed to perform secure API calls to Cloudinary (e.g., image uploads). These parameters are specific to your account. Setting the configuration parameters can be done either programmatically in each call to a Cloudinary method or globally using an environment variable or the config method as shown below: cloudinary.config({ 

cloud_name: 'cld-name', api_key: '874837483274837', 

  api_secret: 'a676b67565c6767a6767d6767f676fe1' 

}); Upload an image Since Cloudinary is able to manipulate images, you only need to upload an image once at the highest resolution. There is no need to upload big/medium/small variants, since those will be created on-the-fly later on. When uploading an image, you can define your own unique ID (as shown below), otherwise the call will create one randomly. In order to upload an image from your local computer, use the following code: cloudinary.v2.uploader.upload("local_folder/image.jpg", {public_id: "sample"}, 
function(error, result) 
{       console.log("** File Upload");
        if (error) {console.warn(error);}
        else {console.log(result);}
        }); In order to upload a remote image using a URL, you can specify it in the first parameter as follows: cloudinary.v2.uploader.upload("http://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/smiling_man.jpg", 
{public_id: "smile"}, 
function(error, result) 
{       console.log("** File Upload");
        if (error) {console.warn(error);}
        else {console.log(result);}
        }); As a response to the upload call, you get some important information back. The response looks like: { public_id: 'smile',
  version: 1474913752,
  signature: '43b46f34e9d4133ffcc2a267c16249ae0df59efc',
  width: 849,
  height: 565,
  format: 'jpg',
  resource_type: 'image',
  created_at: '2016-09-26T18:15:52Z',
  tags: [],
  bytes: 338794,
  type: 'upload',
  etag: 'a70d67e1107e15e2a3d51e1205bd7b78',
  url: 'http://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/v1474913752/smile.jpg',
  secure_url: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/v1474913752/smile.jpg',
  original_filename: 'smiling_man' } In a full scale deployment, it is important to store this information in your own database. You will want to upload several images, which with you can work. The images I used in the examples are: sample, smile, bike and kitten. Now that we have images uploaded, let’s optimize their delivery. Steps to Make your Images Load Faster Step 1 – Use a content delivery network (CDN) The first step for boosting your website image performance is to use a CDN. Cloudinary will provide a CDN once it delivers images from the res.cloudinary.com domain, so no additional work is needed. The default CDN is Akamai, but you have the option of using the CDN of your choice. Step 2 - Use HTTP/2 HTTP/2 aims to improve several issues in HTTP delivery, and it includes support for multiplexing and concurrency. These features enable several image requests to be sent in rapid succession on the same TCP connection, eliminating the need for multiple connections between the client and the server. This capability boosts up the performance of image delivery by 10 percent to 15 percent, especially on pages with many images. Again, this only requires delivery via Cloudinary, which uses HTTP/2 by default. Step 3 - Resize images to their actual display size Instead of having the client download large images and scale them down on the client side, it is better to resize images to the required sizes first, then have the client download them at the correct size. For example, in case the image display size is 640x480 it can be first resized to the required size on the server side and then delivered. This example uses the crop option "fill," which creates an image with the exact given width and height while retaining the original aspect ratio, using only part of the image that fills the given dimensions if necessary. There are a dozen more crop options to select from, documented here. The following code will generate the required HTML for the client delivery: cloudinary.image("sample.jpg", { width: 640, height: 480, crop: "fill", alt: "sample image" }) This is equivalent to: <img src='http://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/w_640,h_480,c_fill/sample.jpg' 
     alt='sample image' height='480' width='640'/> To deliver this image using HTTPS, add the secure flag. cloudinary.image("sample.jpg", { secure: true, width: 640, height: 480, crop: "fill", alt: "sample image" }) HTML <img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/c_fill,h_480,w_640/sample.jpg'  alt='sample image' height='480' width='640' / Note: You can browse directly to the image URL in all the HTML examples and see the image result. Note that the URL is dynamic and all the transformation parameters are part of it, providing the required derivation of the image. Image URL Original image: https://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/sample.jpg
Derived image: https://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/c_fill,h_480,w_640/sample.jpg You also can use JavaScript client-side libraries to create this image tag or only the dynamic image URL part. Cloudinary supports several options: Core JavaScript Library: The core Cloudinary JavaScript library, which does not depend on jQuery. jQuery Plugin: If you are using jQuery, you can take advantage of the Cloudinary jQuery plugin, which includes all the functionality of the Core JavaScript Library. jQuery File Upload: The Cloudinary jQuery File Upload library extends the Cloudinary jQuery plugin that utilizes the Blueimp jQuery File Upload library. This library includes all the functionality of the Core JavaScript Library and the jQuery plugin. More information on using one of these options can be found here. The example above implements resizing for static images, which means that on your page the image always will be shown at this size. An explanation of supporting responsive design, which requires dynamic resizing according to the specific user view port width and is device dependent, will be addressed later. In some cases, you will not only have to resize, but also change the original aspect ratio. In these cases, there is the challenge of cutting out part of the image. By default, cropping is center-based. However, if the interesting part of the image is not in the center, it becomes more challenging. A cool option to avoid too much manual labor is use of gravity auto, which will automatically detect the most interesting part of the picture and put it in the center. In case a face (or faces) are the interesting parts, gravity auto does a great job using automatic face detection. In other scenarios, it will look for change of colors (background is usually of similar color) and areas in focus. This is an example of creating a 1:1 aspect ratio cropped image using automatic gravity: cloudinary.image("smile.jpg", { width: 400, aspect_ratio: "1:1", crop: "fill", gravity: "auto" }) HTML '<img src='http://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/ar_1:1,c_fill,g_auto,w_400/smile.jpg' width='400' />' Step 4 – Deliver images in optimal format Common image formats are JPG, PNG and GIF, which are supported by every browser. There are however modern formats, such as WebP developed by Google and JPEG-XR developed by Microsoft, which are being used as well. These formats can save 30 percent of the image weight, but they are not supported by all browsers. As a result, you can deliver them only to the supporting browsers. Automatic format selection by Cloudinary enables you to easily do this selective delivery. The following code will automatically convert the image on-the-fly to the optimal format once the user’s browser is detected. cloudinary.image("sample.jpg", { width: 640, height: 480, crop: "fill", gravity: "auto", fetch_format: "auto"}) HTML <img src='http://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,g_auto,h_480,w_640/sample.jpg' height='480' width='640'/> Another conversion to consider is PNG to JPG, if the image has no transparency. PNG is a good selection for high-resolution images with fine details or transparency. However, PNG is a lossless format, so it cannot be compressed as much since all the data is retained. JPG is lossy, meaning some data is lost, which is accepted for web delivery in most cases. The reason to use PNG remains for transparency. To bundle both functions together use: cloudinary.image("sample.png", { width: 640, height: 480, crop: "fill", gravity: "auto", fetch_format: "auto", flags:"lossy"}) HTML <img src='http://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_lossy,g_auto,h_480,w_640/sample.png' height='480' width='640' /> GIF is best suited for cases where animation is required. Animated GIF are cool, but they are wasteful in size. A better format for animation is WebP or video, which offer much better compression. Converting to animated WebP for supporting browsers will be done automatically using the auto format shown above. Converting it to video also requires setting the video to loop, mute and not show controls so it looks the same as animated GIF. To do so, in case you uploaded to Cloudinary an animated GIF with public id "kitten," as shown here, all that is required to transform it to video is to change it suffix to the required formats and provide it an a HTML5 video tag as follows: HTML <video autoplay loop muted="muted" 
  poster="http://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/kitten.jpg">
  <source type="video/mp4"
      src="http://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/kitten.mp4">
  <source type="video/webm"
      src="http://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/kitten.webm">
  Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag. 
  <a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/kitten.gif">Click here to view original GIF</a> 
</video> Step 5 – Deliver images in optimal quality Image quality is another important parameter for optimization. The higher the quality, the larger the file size. While you want to show high-quality images on your website, keep in mind there are cases in which compressing the image a bit further will still provide a great result that looks visually identical. Cloudinary automates the file size versus quality trade-off decision on-the-fly by using perceptual metrics and heuristics that tune the quality settings based on the specific image content and format. This is done by setting the quality parameter to automatic. You can additionally tune to a certain level auto:best/good/eco/low. But, by default the "good" setting used, which will provide the optimal balance between file size and visual quality. Bundling it all together: cloudinary.image("sample.jpg", { width: 640, height: 480, crop: "fill", gravity: "auto", fetch_format: "auto", flags:"lossy", quality: "auto" } HTML <img src='http://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_lossy,g_auto,h_480,q_auto,w_640/sample.jpg' height='480' width='640'/> Test what we did so far Select a page with many images, upload them to Cloudinary, update the delivery URLs and check how much you saved in page weight and page load time. Responsive Design Responsive design also helps to optimize image performance by supporting dynamic selection of image sizes. There are several options to implement this using Cloudinary which are based on different methods: HTML5, Cloudinary Java Script and implementing client hints. For more information on each option, see this. Here responsive images implemented using HTML5 srcset is described. In this case, the browser does the work of selecting the image to download according to the available view-port width. To further optimize this selection, you can calculate the optimal image breakpoints, which will be provided to the browser as options from which to select. The key parameter for this calculation is the amount of bytes to save for each derived image. The other required parameters are: minimum width of image, maximum width of image and whether to create the derived images on-the-fly or upon upload. You can do this calculation upon upload or run it on an image already uploaded to your account as shown here. cloudinary.v2.uploader.explicit("bike",
        { type: "upload", responsive_breakpoints: [{
          create_derived: true, 
          bytes_step: 40000,
          min_width: 200, 
          max_width: 1000,
          max_images: 10}]}, 
          function(error, result) { console.log("** Optimal breakpoints calculation");
         if (error){ console.warn(error);}
        else {console.log(result);}
});
 Cloudinary responds with a JSON object, including the image urls, dimensions, file size.  Then you pull this information from the JSON object and write it to an <img> tag using the "srcset" attribute, like shown the following example. The result: A responsive image with optimal breakpoints. HTML <img sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"
srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/c_scale,w_200,f_auto,q_auto/bike.jpg 200w,
               https://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/c_scale,w_560,f_auto,q_auto/bike.jpg 554w,
               https://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/c_scale,w_790,f_auto,q_auto/bike.jpg 797w,
               https://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/c_scale,w_1000,f_auto,q_auto/bike.jpg 1000w"
    src=" https://res.cloudinary.com/cld-name/image/upload/ c_scale,w_1000,f_auto,q_auto/bike.jpg"
    alt="A bike" /> You also can calculate the optimal breakpoints for the same image cropped to different aspect ratios using automatic gravity. Then you enter the different aspect ratio options with their calculated breakpoints to a picture tag and use art-direction to select which image to use for which view-port. For example using 1:1 crop for smartphone, 4:3 for tablet, 16:9 for small laptop and full image view for desktop. Cloudinary has created an online tool for doing these optimal breakpoint calculations and aspect ratio manipulations. You can check it out here and see the code in action.

The Korean company rushed production to beat the new iPhone, encountered a serious hardware defect that caused batteries to catch fire, and then fumbled its way through an inconsistent recall process. Completing the self-harm, Samsung’s replacement Galaxy Notes started self-combusting just as the original ones did, and today the conclusion to this unhappy chapter was written by Samsung killing off its big-time smartphone. But accounting for the damage done by the Note 7 is only just beginning, and it’ll be done under the colossal shadow of Google and its newfound ambitions as a phone maker. At the time of the new Galaxy Note’s arrival this summer, Samsung was a company on a roll. It had wowed both critics and the public with the Galaxy S6, S7, and their Edge counterparts, and it had delivered arguably the best smartwatch experience with the Gear S2. As hardware manufacturers go, it’s hard to imagine anyone having as good and consistent a couple of years in public perception as Samsung was enjoying from late 2014 until now. But that was always Samsung’s greatest vulnerability: being just a hardware manufacturer. The Note 7 debacle undermines Samsung's singular attraction of awesome hardware It’s a truism now that to have success as a vendor of personal technology products, you need the holy trifecta of hardware, software, and services. If we can personalize the smartphone for a moment, good hardware is akin to having an attractive smile, winning software is like a great sense of humor, and valuable services are all the things you’d miss if he / she / it were gone. Samsung was only ever a one-dimensional winner on that triangle of prerequisites. Awesome specs, terrific camera, and some of the finest industrial design in the world, yes, but that was all hardware. And now Samsung has suffered through a month of bad publicity precisely about the reliability and safety of its hardware. Of course, Samsung couldn’t be the world’s biggest smartphone maker if it lacked software and services, but aside from Samsung Pay, those have come almost exclusively from Google. Without Android and the Play Store, you’d have a Tizen phone — and those aren’t selling in the tens of millions each month like Samsung’s Android devices are. Put very simply, Samsung’s formula for success was to ride Android and distinguish itself with unique products, whose advantage stemmed from its almost unrivaled vertical integration and ability to produce components others can’t. Well, that crumbles into nothing when consumers don’t trust your hardware to not blow up in their face. Read more: What's the latest on Samsung's Note 7 disaster? Samsung’s misfires may be something the company could recover from over time, perhaps, but there’s a new spoiler arriving on the scene just in time to make matters much harder for the Galaxy line, and that’s Google’s Pixel phone. The premium tier of Android smartphones has grown uncompetitive in recent times, with Samsung rightly earning the lion’s share of sales, profits, and public approbation. The Pixel was already en route to challenging that Galaxy dominance, but now Google’s path toward competing directly with Samsung has been shortened and eased considerably. Instead of having to answer tough questions about why people should consider a Pixel XL over a better-designed Note 7, Google can simply point out that the Pixel has newer and better software than the Galaxy S7, it runs on a faster processor, is the first to tap into Google Daydream, and will likely be supported with security and OS patches for much longer. The first-generation Pixel won’t outsell Samsung’s Galaxy lineup — Google’s phone is only being released in a few countries and won’t be available in three of the four big US carriers’ stores, after all — but the marketing blitz and positive vibes around it will chip away at Samsung’s position as the premium tier leader. Things look bleak for Samsung on both the short- and long-term scale. In the immediate future, the company loses its centerpiece attraction for the holiday shopping season and will have to contend with shoppers who’ll be conscious of explosive Galaxy phones — but likely less certain about the specific model to avoid, and therefore avoiding all of them. Those same shoppers will be exposed to at least one of Google’s many nationwide TV spots for the Pixel, which is a ploy that will pay off for Google in the future, when Pixels will presumably be accessible to all potential buyers. And then, unlike Apple, which has the ecosystem stickiness of things like iMessage, Samsung will have no extra charms with which to keep people around. If its physical design and hardware aren’t perfect or exceptional, it sinks. Samsung's making it almost too easy for Google Over the long run, Google’s Pixel line will only grow in its distribution, marketing, and mindshare among the public. What we’re seeing today is Google Phone 1.0, and future designs will gain in sophistication while Google continues to deliver unique software features like Google Assistant to its own hardware first. It’ll be a slow and gradual strangulation, but Google looks well positioned to choke out Samsung’s lead in the US and supplant it as the chief competitor to the iPhone, if it’s able to execute its plan correctly. Yes, Samsung has sold upwards of 30 million Galaxy S7s in the country this year, but that was before it completely screwed up both its quality assurance and subsequent recall with the Galaxy Note 7. Hype matters, and it’s all negative for Samsung today, with no immediate reprieve on the horizon. The full extent of the Galaxy Note 7’s damage won’t be known for a while, however it’s already certain that this phone’s ghost will haunt Samsung for a long time. Apple is still the subject of jibes about its antenna issues with the iPhone 4, which was released half a decade ago, so we shouldn’t expect Samsung to escape close scrutiny of its batteries for years to come. While that’s going on, Google’s proposition will only grow stronger and better known. No, Google won’t topple Samsung’s global empire, and least not anytime soon — but the two companies seem locked into trajectories that will see a new premier vendor of premium Android phones, and that might just be the original purveyor of Android itself.

Alphabet's Google unit already released a new smartphone that features its artificially intelligent assistant along with a speaker with the feature at its core. The company also plans on allowing other companies to embed their own apps and services with its intelligent assistant. Samsung, Viv And The AI Race Google's seemingly unlimited resources and expertise will now be challenged by SAMSUNG ELECTRONIC KRW5000 (OTC: SSNLF), which recently acquired Viv Labs, a next-generation artificial intelligence platform. As noted by Bloomberg, Samsung acquiring Viv is "more of a problem for Google" than it is for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL, given the fact that Samsung happens to be the largest maker of smartphones running on Google's Android mobile operating system. Related Link: iPhone Lovers Rejoice: Samsung Will No Longer Manufacture The Galaxy Note 7 Google's strategy moving forward will likely place a greater emphasis on its assistant, because its a "more natural way for people to interact with smartphones and other connected devices." As such, the company wants its assistant to be embedded in hundreds of millions of smartphones across the world but Samsung's acquisition of Viv may suggest it could stand in Google's way. Samsung already said it will include Viv's technology in its smartphones as soon as next year, and after that, the technology will be embedded in other electronics and home appliances. "As AI is becoming more sophisticated and valuable to the consumer, there's no question it will be important for hardware companies," Bloomberg quoted Kirt McMaster, the executive chairman of Cyanogen Inc., a startup that makes Android software as saying.

SUBSCRIBE Google looking at how to measure brand awareness for search Will Google ever give sites credit for brand name mentions or citations without an actual link? Gary Illyes from Google said Google's UX team is looking at ways to measure brand awareness. Barry Schwartz on October 11, 2016 at 9:09 am More In A conversation with Google’s Gary Illyes (part 1) podcast at Marketing Land, our sister site, Gary Illyes told us that Google is looking at ways to measure brand awareness in search. Gary Illyes said this when we asked about how Google sources featured snippets with Google Home voice assistant. Gary explained that measuring brand mentions, without links, is hard, but the user experience team at Google is looking at ways to do this. In context, Danny Sullivan asked Gary what publishers get out of Google Home saying the name of the site. Is there any ranking benefit to it? Does it lead to any traffic to your site? Gary explained that he first discovered Search Engine Land through brand mentions in forums, not through a link. He then goes on to explain that the Google team is looking at ways to measure “brand awareness.” Here is the snippet of the audio where Gary Illyes said this: Here is the audio transcript: Danny Sullivan: So the feeling is that you’ll get enough brand awareness? Gary Illyes: Something that you can’t measure easily. We are thinking about how to actually, like, measure that in aggregate. I think that UXers are on it.

Oct 11, 2016 • 7:40 am | (3) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google AdWords Prev Story Next Story This is something I never thought of before - what if you have a Google AdWords campaign running with your Google account and you delete your Google account - what happens to the campaign? Well, nothing - it keeps running as you originally set it. An advertiser asked Google this on Twitter and Google said "deleting your Google account will not stop your AdWords campaigns." Of course, I assume once you delete your Google account associated with the AdWords campaign - getting back in to make changes or end the campaign will require a phone call to Google instead of just logging in and ending it yourself. @VMT4K Hi there, deleting your Google account will not stop your AdWords campaigns. Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions. -Mitch— Google AdWords (@adwords) October 10, 2016 So don't go ahead and delete your Google account as an attempt to stop your AdWords campaigns - it doesn't seem like the best idea.

Link labels are basically various attributes or characteristics added to a site's link profile, on a link-by-link basis. So if page A links to my home page, that page A link can have multiple link labels. Some of the examples of what labels would be given to a link include footer links, Penguin real time links, disavowed links and so on. In short, algorithms and systems are automatically labeling links with these labels. And Gary said that Googlers do have access to see what labels are on a specific link. So while Google's manual action team may not get automated flags from algorithms about sites they should investigate - if they are looking at a site and see some link label issues, they may dive deeper and find more issues, he said. Here is the audio of that interview: I posted the transcript over here. Here are some tweets that found this interview interesting: E.g. this. @sengineland @rustybrick pic.twitter.com/E9xxufQSAi— John Doherty (@dohertyjf) October 10, 2016 A "link tagging" system used by Google.

If the webspam team sees you're disavowing, they know you're actively trying to work on link spam. pic.twitter.com/tdJ9aU5F4F— Marie Haynes (@Marie_Haynes) October 10, 2016 I guess this is why Google says keep using the disavow file to protect your site.

Spammers still on top on many niches. All with obvious spammy backlinks (footer links, kw rich anchors, blogrolls, PBNs...). We should expect this "devaluation" in few days or what? Donald 10/11/2016 01:37 pm You spam-monkeys who have spent the past 2 weeks hoping and wondering if you could remove your disavow file to get some of your old spam links counted as a positive now have your answer. Alpha Male in a Beta World 10/11/2016 02:24 pm To the person who said we were "just doing a lot of busy work" by checking sites that scrape our content and adding their domain to our disavow file... na na na na booh booh! [insert emoji with tongue sticking out, wiggling fingers by our ears and making fart noises] sda 10/11/2016 02:35 pm get back to your 1$ a week earning Scooter 10/11/2016 03:09 pm Google still ignores scrapers as they have for years, buffoon. SD1981 10/11/2016 03:13 pm Sounds like Google/Penguin still recognizes patterns of spam link building and acts on what it finds. So don't go and build thousands of links hoping they only get devalued. Some may stick and earn you a manual action. Donald 10/11/2016 03:14 pm Oops - did I poke a big hole in your "strategy"? LOL Jerry B. 10/11/2016 03:21 pm Anybody get a manual action or unnatural links notice since P4 rolled out? Seems like it would take a long time for manual reviewers to notice a site has a lot of penguin flags. I think it is unlikely that Google will put a lot more resources into manual reviews, but it does seem like it's only a matter of time until penguin links are smacked manually. Quiet here lately. I guess everyone is enjoying recoveries and there isn't much to whine about these days. Jerry B's special friend 10/11/2016 04:15 pm Hi Jerry, missed you.. everything ok? Anon User 10/11/2016 04:53 pm Recoveries ... Yeah, ALL the SEO gurus who specialised in saving their clients arses with link pruning are raving about their recoveries. Or...NOT You would think that the so called self appointed experts who built their house of cards on Penguin would be posting recovery after recovery but judging by the number of posts the success rate was not so good. We will see though. Still seems to be a hell of a lot of movement right now so perhaps it's not all over yet. Recovering keyword spammer 10/11/2016 04:58 pm And what about all those who've been link building like crazy for the last two years? I haven't seen a single demotion which is strange as those links that were giving them a boost are now supposed to be getting ignored. I await Barry's up coming post on the subject this week. Boris 10/11/2016 05:01 pm Go to their sites if you want to see the claimed recoveries. Only the Indian spammers post so called results here when they drop links. I think you are correct that it isn't over yet. Boris 10/11/2016 05:03 pm Penguin no longer demotes. This has been the biggest news about Penguin. The spam links to those sites were probably never counted. Sites sometimes rank despite spam links and not because of them. Scooter 10/11/2016 05:04 pm Who goes to a site to brag about how good things are? Nobody. People only comment here when they are upset. Anon User 10/11/2016 05:07 pm Not True at all! The GURUS of link recovery love nothing more than to toot their horn here when they have a recovery to show. So, lets just humor you for one brief second so you don't think I would not check out the sites of say at least one so called expert. Go to Marie H website who puts herself over as a genius of penguin. One thing you will see is a very large void for penguin recovery stories. Now, I might well be jumping the gun here and Marie might well be working on a 1000 recovery case studies and has yet had the time to post the data ... anyway.. We will see. Anon User 10/11/2016 05:07 pm See my reply to BORIS Anon User 10/11/2016 05:08 pm At last Boris says something that makes sense. AGREE!!!! Recovering keyword spammer 10/11/2016 05:10 pm Sorry 'demotion' was the wrong word, I meant ranking drop as a result of previously counted crappy links now being ignored, the result is the same.. heading south in the serps. but it still doesn't make sense. If the thousands of crap links some sites have built since P3 were already being ignored, there was no need for P4 surely? Yeah sure some will have been ignored but not all, and you would expect to see a few of those sites drop a bit. No? Scooter 10/11/2016 05:24 pm I don't think you will see many of the penalty specialists posting results about Penguin. Since the wait for the update for the disavow and removals to work routine has changed, it is too difficult to know if a recovery is from the work done or not. I suppose if the site shows gradual improvement in organic traffic leading up to September 23 that may reflect work on the site and new links, though. Penguin specialists have nothing to sell right now since nobody knows exactly what the new Penguin does, and it isn't punitive so there isn't a Penguin penalty to recover from. So they won't be running around saying "Look what I did and can do it for you too!" Jerry B. 10/11/2016 05:27 pm "they won't be running around saying "Look what I did and can do it for you too!"" Anybody saying that right now is full of crap. I'm sure some will do that soon if they aren't already. Good point about penguin specialists having nothing to sell regarding penguin - so not much point in bragging about something that won't work anymore. Jerry B 10/11/2016 05:27 pm My hemorrhoids got really bad after the Penguin 4 launch. My doctor says I need to stop putting a banana in my butt, but I told him to provide links proving that works and accused him of being a quack. My truth is the right truth! Vote Trump! Jerry B's special friend 10/11/2016 05:40 pm Jerry you are the biggest alpha on the planet, no lie! You make The Donald look like a lefty snowflake!!!! Jerry B 10/11/2016 05:41 pm Links? No offense but you are a filthy web spammer. I'm hungry. Where's my banana? Boris 10/12/2016 12:08 pm No. Ignored, not much value, never found by googlebot because they are on such spammy sites, were already disavowed, not as bad as you think they are... there are many reasons links can appear to have no effect. Then there are also hundreds of other ranking factors which can make all those links not have as much impact on the site's rankings. Johnny J 10/12/2016 12:43 pm We don't know if it won't work anymore yet, and it wouldn't be prudent to sell that as a service until it is known. Thus, no brags/sales-pitches.

Recovering keyword spammer 10/12/2016 01:40 pm Our traffic is way below normal today 23 10/12/2016 02:16 pm I am up up up woop woop The Truth 10/12/2016 03:44 pm Over all I am pretty happy with this Penguin so far. Good job Google! Recovering keyword spammer 10/12/2016 04:01 pm I've got a question for all the SEO gurus around here. Firstly, We get most of our organic traffic from 5 or 6 main keyword phrases, which we monitor, and which have stayed steady for a long time, and still are post P4. However, we're seeing unusual highs and lows in our organic traffic (and conversions). Like today for example is quieter than Christmas day, which is always dead, but a couple of days ago we were above normal for the time of year. It's just plain weird. We saw this a bit several months ago where we would have a quiet morning, but booming afternoon, one busy day, followed by dead. Not the normal averaging out you get. So, my question is, can Google decide how much organic traffic a site gets (and maybe the quality of it) and if so, how the hell does it do it when you're still ranking exactly the same? dassad 10/12/2016 04:14 pm go to webmaster world and join the zombie traffic discussion. Ben alloy 10/12/2016 04:25 pm Adwords. Enjoy Jerry B. 10/12/2016 04:27 pm There are so many possible explanations it is hard to know where to begin. First, search traffic and rankings are still very volatile since P4. Whatever you are doing to check rankings may not show you what others are seeing at any given moment. Second, you don't know if the keywords you are watching are really what is driving traffic or if it is other phrases. Keywords as a measurement are really only good for a general idea. Use rankings as benchmarks if you must, but unless you have a way around Google's hiding of actual keyword searches in analytics, you just don't know what search terms are working for you. Search Console's search analytics can show you actual terms, but the data is delayed and probably incomplete - so not very useful for comparing day to day. Third, search traffic is always kind of volatile. Some days, several unrelated sites will all show higher or lower than average traffic as if the whole world is in a good or bad mood. Yeah, it's weird. Sometimes people just aren't searching your keywords as often as other days. And if your usual search traffic is less than say 100 visits a day, comparing one day to another is nearly useless. Not enough data to be able to discount the normal fluctuations. Don't go down the rabbit hole with those zombie conspiracy theorists who think Google has people sitting around turning a traffic faucet on or off. Recovering keyword spammer 10/12/2016 04:27 pm I'm talking organic, zombie traffic is adwords related Jerry B. 10/12/2016 04:30 pm So they are not really only favoring big brands and ripping people off with Adwords like you have been saying for months? The Truth 10/12/2016 04:51 pm Oh they are still favoring big brands, & decreasing the quality of search results with the new top heavy ad layout. But I do think they took a better approach with the new Penguin & it never would have happened if members of the search community never voiced their complaints. #4 Democracy on the web works toty 10/12/2016 05:40 pm asshole Simon 10/12/2016 06:45 pm That might be the dumbest or comment I have ever read. Google doesn't favor big brands. The ad layout is not new. Google doesn't care about whiners. You'll be back to whining in no time when Penguin finishes updating and Google remembers it didn't like your site. The Truth 10/12/2016 07:22 pm This is for you, because you need it. { } rosscoh 10/13/2016 01:18 am My question is we took a machete to our links two years ago and if was even close to grey we put it in the disavow. There are roughly 4k links in our disavow at the moment. Should we prune it back in light of this and let some of those we were way too cautious with back in? Really haven't seen this exact question answered. Phil Blackwell 10/13/2016 12:10 pm Firstly, great interview Barry. Listened to both parts and was very impressed and surprised by Gary's openness to your questions. Secondly, I completely agree with rosscoh. This would make a good test. Theoretically, removing links from your disavow file that you included out of panic and fear of Penguin, should now be safe to allow. Unless, of course, allowing them would dilute your link profile to such an extent that it puts you at risk of manual action. Would love to hear other people's thoughts on this subject. Winston 10/19/2016 01:34 pm Good answer. It is a shame that the person who asked it doesn't want to hear any of that. blog comments powered by Disqus The pulse of the search community Subscribe Subscribe options ADVERTISERS Search buzz Video 11/11/2016 08:39 am Subscribe More videos Video Details Browse by: Browse by Date Find by Category Discover by Author Scan Most Recent See Comments View Tag Cloud SEM FORUM THREADS WebmasterWorld Forums Best Practices for Indexable Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) Facebook Messenger 1.3 Now Allows Sponsored Messages Digital Point Forums What is the Difference Between Autumn and Fall SEO Expert to Remove Google Penalty Sponsored links Best SEO Company Link Penalty Recovery £200 includes locating & contacting Submit a Thread Forum Search Awards About Us Seals Advertise Contact Full Site The content at the Search Engine Roundtable are the sole opinion of the authors and in no way reflect views of RustyBrick ®, Inc Copyright © 1994-2016 RustyBrick ®, Inc.

I mean, it sounds nice and all but no where in Google's announcement did it mention machine learning - and trust me - Google wants to use ML in their marketing and PR as much as possible. Well, Google's Gary Illyes told Jennifer Slegg that Google is not using Machine Learning in Penguin. This was via a simple Twitter exchange where Jennifer asked "Is Penguin a machine learning algorithm, or use any kind of supervised or unsupervised learning?" Gary Illyes responded, in short, "nope." @jenstar nope— Gary Illyes (@methode) October 10, 2016 I believe Rand Fishkin was one of the first to speculate that Penguin using ML: Most important detail of the announcement is the change to how it operates (ML-based consideration of ranking signals, more like RankBrain) pic.twitter.com/eA1Lo37A14— Rand Fishkin (@randfish) September 23, 2016 But this is not true - I mean, if you believe Google - which I do. Former Google spam fighter, Murat Yatagan, said Google does use machine learning to fight spam but you need to read the whole thing to get the context. Forum discussion at Twitter.

In short, and I think most SEOs understand this already, is Penguin looks at the page linking to your site. If that page is really bad, it can be labeled as a Penguin link. Some SEOs may have confused links as just the anchor text or the URL. But when I pried on the concept that Google calls Penguin a "web spam algorithm" and specifically not a "link spam algorithm" - Gary said this is why - because it looks at the source the link is coming from. Google Penguin looks at "the source site, not on the target site" he said in the interview. So it is not about the destination of the link but rather the source of the link. An example he gave of a link source that might be slapped with a Penguin label is a source page that is a low quality forum profile page that links to you. He said "empty profile pages, forum profile pages" might be one example. Here is the audio embed: The transcript is over here. Glenn Gabe nicely summed it up in this tweet as well: Google: "Webspam" with Penguin relates to the SOURCE site, not DESTINATION. Many were looking at the wrong side :) https://t.co/PNQ2QSiyFu— Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) October 11, 2016 Again, most of you all probably knew this but I don't think we had Google provide such transparency on the concept that Penguin is based on the link source versus link destination or anchor text or something else.

Get the book now → An Interview With Jungkee Song What’s The Deal With The Samsung Internet Browser? By Peter-Paul Koch October 11th, 2016 AppsBrowsersInterviews 8 Comments According to browser statistics, Chrome for Android is currently1 the largest mobile browser, or is about to become so2. Still, too few web developers realize that these Chrome for Android numbers in fact contain several browsers, not just Google Chrome. After discussing the general state of affairs in this article, we’ll focus on the Chromium-based Samsung browser specifically. Immediate and full disclosure: Samsung paid me to write this article. Still, it’s one I’ve wanted to write for 18 months, so it kind of evens out. The Plural Of Chromium Is Chromia Link In the past few years, just about all Android device vendors have upgraded their default browsers to Chromium… but not to Google Chrome. Instead, they took an older Chromium version of their choice, modified it somewhat, and added it to their devices as “Internet” or “Browser.” To make matters more complicated, most vendors are contractually obliged to install Google Chrome on their devices as well. Thus, most modern Android devices come with two Chromium-based browsers installed — but web developers test only in Google Chrome and tend to forget about Samsung Chromium, and HTC Chromium, and LG Chromium, and all of the others. To me, this is not a desirable situation. At their core, these Chromium-based browsers are the same. There are no huge incompatibilities in the rendering layer lying in wait to trap the unaware web developer. Still, there are a few differences in certain CSS, JavaScript and interface features that web developers need to know about. See, for instance, Can I Use’s comparison3 of the Samsung browser and the latest Chrome. I became interested in this topic back in early 20154, and apart from attempting to notify other web developers that there are several Chromia — which is the proper, Latinate plural of Chromium (my classical education will show from time to time) — and being met with total disinterest, I tried to find some solid numbers on how many people exactly are using a non-Google Chrome for Android. Market Shares Link Mobile browser market shares, unfortunately, are hard to obtain. Until this year, no public source has made any distinction between Google Chrome and the vendor-specific Chromia. On the other hand, the use of non-Google Chromia is clearly bound to device market share, and seeing that Samsung is by far the largest Android vendor, with about 37% market share5, the conclusion that the Samsung Chromium browser would be the largest of the non-Google ones was fairly obvious from the start. Samsung Internet (which is the official, and quite boring, name of the Samsung Chromium browser) has about 400 million active users globally (source: the interview below). For comparison, Google Chrome for Android has about 1 billion6. But what percentage of Samsung device owners actually use Samsung Internet? The Google Chrome number spans all device types and is not directly comparable with the Samsung number, which is limited to Samsung devices. Research I did last year7 suggests that about 65% of Samsung users use Samsung Internet — although these numbers are based on one day of statistics from a Dutch ad agency, so they should be taken with a grain of salt. Still, I’m willing to believe that a majority of Samsung device owners use Samsung Internet and not Google Chrome, which by default is hidden in the apps menu. The reasons I believe so are illustrated by a hilarious encounter I had recently. I was speaking with a woman who is not involved in web development at all, and asked her which mobile browser she uses. “Internet Explorer,” she said. “Oh,” I replied, “so you have a Windows Phone?” “No,” she said, “a Galaxy S7.” And she pointed at the Samsung Internet icon, which clearly states “Internet.” She was quite surprised to hear it was not Internet Explorer, and that Google Chrome was also installed on her device, although my attempt at explaining the relationship between all of these browsers failed miserably. (Then again, even some web developers don’t get that bit.) Anecdote, not data, yaddah yaddah, but I think this story highlights the point of view of consumers, and the reason why many will use Samsung Internet: They don’t know they have a choice and are confused anyway. Also, it shows that Samsung should find a better name for its browser. Back to stats. In January, StatCounter started to count8 Samsung Internet separately from the other Chromia, which allows us to conclude that Samsung Internet has a global market share of about 7%, while all other Chromia on Android combined, including Google’s, sit on about 37%. Locally this market share may be higher; for instance in Germany9, where it’s 18%. I wonder if 18%, or even 7%, of web developers bother to test in Samsung Internet as a browser distinct from Google Chrome. And for close to a year now, I’ve been debating about what to do about this state of affairs, particularly in light of the refusal of Asian companies to speak with web developers. (Believe me, I tried for seven years, and it wasn’t fun.) Opening Up Link Then, at the start of 2016, things changed. Samsung opened up and now wants to reach out and become a web citizen in good standing — and become a major player on the web. (Some major web players have less mobile market share than Samsung does, so I’m fundamentally sympathetic to this desire.) This is good news for web developers: Any time a browser vendor opens up, the web becomes a touch more diverse, and, more importantly, we get one more browser vendor to send snarky comments to. What’s not to like? In fact, it turns out Samsung is taking this process of opening up very seriously indeed. It created a London-based developer relations group (@samsunginternet1710 on Twitter) — among others, consisting of Ada Rose Edwards11 of Financial Times fame — and a Medium channel1812. Also, if you want to get in touch directly with Samsung browser engineers, you can email them at browser[AT]samsung[DOT]com — but please remember to be polite and patient, as you would like other people to behave towards you. Interview Link Because I was granted access to Samsung’s browser engineers a few weeks in advance of the rest of the world, and because I want to get a grip on the non-Google Chromium market and understand Samsung’s goals and ideas, I interviewed Jungkee Song13 of the Samsung Internet team. Peter-Paul: Hello, Jungkee. Could you briefly introduce yourself? Jungkee: Hello. I’m a software engineer on the Samsung Internet team, working on the web platform and web standards. I’m one of the co-editors of the service workers spec14 (along with Google’s Alex Russell and Jake Archibald) and a Chromium contributor. Also, I’m trying to meet web developers as often as I can in order to evangelize and discuss progressive web app technologies — and our browser, of course. Peter-Paul: Why did Samsung decide to create its own browser, instead of using Google Chrome? Jungkee: First, Samsung aims to deliver a good mobile web experience to users based on device features such as bio sensors, payments and VR. We would like to bring such device technologies to the web, and we found the best way to do that is by creating our own browser. Secondly, the web is a neutral platform, and no single browser vendor can make the web a better place alone. Diversity of and competition between browsers is a fundamental part of the web. Samsung intends to be one of the players that extend the open web as a common platform — thus, our involvement with service workers, progressive web apps, web and VR integration, and other web innovations. Thirdly, Samsung provides many types of devices, including, but not limited to, smartphones, tablets, Gear VR, Gear Watch, smart TVs and home appliances. The web should be present on all such devices, which, again, requires us to create our own browser. Peter-Paul: Can you give some examples of changes Samsung made to the default Chromium browser? Jungkee: Most have to do with Samsung-specific hardware. Samsung Internet supports a secret mode15 that uses the biometric sensor in Galaxy devices. We also allow users to use third-party plugins for content blocking. Another example is our Gear VR integration, which requires the WebVR API and seamless interaction between the phone browser and the Gear VR browser. Peter-Paul: Have you ever considered using an engine other than Chromium? Jungkee: Yes. When we started, we examined WebKit, Gecko and Blink. We found all of them have their pros and cons, but we selected the one that adopts the latest web features fastest, is well maintained, and has a huge developer community: the Chromium project. It was around early 2013 when we made that decision. We shipped our first Chromium-based browser in one of the Galaxy S4 models released later in 2013. Peter-Paul: How do you decide which Chromium version you’re going to use? Jungkee: This question has no easy answer. We try to balance adoption of the latest features with the stability of our software and our internal deadlines. Although we’d love to bring out new features as fast as possible, our products have to go through a rigorous QA process, and therefore we don’t always work with the latest version. Still, from time to time we cherry-pick important new features that were released in a later Chromium version than the one we use for our base branch. For example, Samsung Internet 4.0 is based on Chromium 44 but supports service worker features up to around Chromium 48. Also, we always backport major security patches to our browser. Peter-Paul: Do you also work on the core Chromium project? Jungkee: Certainly! Currently we have 2 owners and around 20 committers. We are mainly working on features that we think are important to extend the web. For instance, we have contributed a number of patches to the service workers API, the notification API, payments, canvas 2D and so on. Standards we currently focus on include web payment, web VR and progressive web apps. We would like a chance to take on work on those, but right now we concentrate on core features that improve the user experience. Peter-Paul: On how many device types does Samsung Internet run? Jungkee: Samsung Internet 4.0 runs on these Samsung devices16; and please note they’re all high-end or mid-range smartphones. That’s because of the speed and memory we need to run Samsung Internet: 768 MB of RAM and 1 GHz dual core of CPU clock. There are no differences between the Samsung Internet versions running on different devices. Samsung Internet 4.0 also runs on the Samsung Gear VR devices, as well as on Android tablets, but there we don’t support automatic updates yet. Also, Tizen 3.0, the OS for Samsung TVs, will come with Samsung Internet. It’s possible our browser will also come to Gear Watch, but we have no concrete plans yet. Peter-Paul: And how many users does it have? Jungkee: We estimate Samsung Internet has about 400 milion global monthly active users. Peter-Paul: Seeing that Samsung Internet is now an evergreen browser, how often do you think you’re going to update it? Jungkee: We provide two types of software updates: the update through OS and firmware updates, as all device vendors do, and updates through the app market, as Google, Mozilla and Opera do. We aim to provide updates twice a year through either Galaxy Apps or Play Store, but we are still working on the process. Nonetheless, we successfully deployed Samsung Internet 4.0 back in February, so we’re starting to get somewhere. Peter-Paul: Any chance of a beta channel? Jungkee: We don’t have any concrete plans for a beta channel yet, even though Samsung Internet 4.0 was available as a closed beta. Peter-Paul: Do you plan to eventually ship the latest Samsung Internet version on all Samsung Android devices? Jungkee: Ideally, yes. However, we ship so many different devices that the version upgrade will be provided in several ways: shipping in a new device, firmware updates (for example, with OS upgrades) and market updates. Peter-Paul: Will we see Samsung Internet on non-Samsung devices? Jungkee: We have no concrete plans at this time. Right now, we concentrate on our Galaxy smartphones, tablets and Gear VR, and after that on Tizen and Gear Watch. Once we’ve done that, we may start planning for a version for non-Samsung devices. Peter-Paul: Apart from Samsung Internet, does Samsung create and maintain any other browsers for low-end devices? Jungkee: We shipped some low-end Tizen devices that have a WebKit-based browser, but, as I said, we plan to ship a Chromium-based browser for Tizen 3.0. Peter-Paul: In addition to Samsung Internet, Samsung devices also come with Google Chrome preinstalled. Why is that? Jungkee: Choice is a good thing. We think users should be able to choose which browser they use to access the web. We think Samsung Internet brings some distinct advantages for Samsung device users that make the web more useful, but we don’t feel we have to restrict the browsers on Samsung devices in order to artificially lock users into using our browser. Our growing market share numbers bear this out. Peter-Paul: Thank you for your time. Jungkee: You’re welcome. And remember, if your readers have any questions for Samsung, they can use one of the following contact options: Send an email to browser[AT]samsung[DOT]com. Our newly-formed developer relations team in London has a Twitter account, @samsunginternet1710, and is posting articles on our Medium channel1812. We’re also monitoring Stack Overflow19 for Samsung Internet-related questions, so you can always ask there. We are planning to open a forum or more channels to communicate with web developers, so stay tuned for our next move. Front page image credits: Mono-live20.

I am hopeful that we eventually see a beta channel and more concrete info on various features (my current pet desired feature is payload support in push events for Service Workers that came in Chromium 50). I’ve been pushing our dev team to be aware of this browser and to add it to our test support list. Very surprised that tablets do not receive automatic updates, or am I misunderstanding that? Reply 3 2 Jungkee Song October 13, 2016 6:43 am As of now, we don’t have any concrete plan for opening a public beta channel. But I’ll try to check if there’s a way I can help your testing. Please leave me your email at jungkee.song at samsung dot com. I expect the Push API payload will be shipped in the next version. And regarding the update for tablets, we don’t yet support automatic update through galaxy apps or play store, but the update along with the firmware update and OS upgrade is supported. Stay tuned. Thanks for your interests! Reply 0 3 Leo October 17, 2016 9:03 am I am a front-end developer and I cover Samsung Internet as well. I hate it. It is so different to Chrome in a bad way. It even performs worse than the browser on Samsung S3. Yes, it has feature, but lacks performance. Sorry to hear that Samsung will try to extend its presence. As far as I see it – they only care about how the browser implements the HW features of their phones so for me – it is more new features than actually fixing existing issues. It is not likely for it to get better for at least a couple of years. I really hope they prove me wrong and fix the performance of the browser. Reply 1 4 Dogan Kutbay October 18, 2016 11:51 pm Jungkee: Choice is a good thing. We think users should be able to choose which browser they use to access the web. Really Jungkee? Then why don’t you talk about not being able to remove Chrome? The only “choice” your company gives us is to disable the app. Jungkee why do I have to install Package Disabler Pro to get rid of your bloatware? Jungkee why can’t you outright say “We need minimum 768mb RAM because our company puts too much bloat that phones can’t handle simple tasks like browsing the internet” So Jungkee is just random dude throwing random words. ps. Jungkee, I don’t own a low-end phone. I own your latest phone which is S7 Edge. Reply 8 5 Vincent October 20, 2016 9:28 am Let’s get real. In the first part of the article he clearly stated: “Immediate and full disclosure: Samsung paid me to write this article. ” It’s clear you won’t see any critical questions or responses. It was interesting to read Samsung’s (PR) reasoning for using their own browser but I didn’t really expect anything new and didn’t get it. Reply 0 6 Renzo October 21, 2016 9:25 am I don’t see any problem with that. The start of the article is a ‘state-of-affairs’ summary, which is always welcome. And for the second part, I agree that the awnsers are PR focussed, but it’s also to get the word out how Samsung Internet wants to go forward and open up/connect to dev’s. Nothing wrong for them to want to broadcast that message, and I see nothing wrong for with being payed for publishing (and it’s not like Samsung is making Paul take a stance on anything here). Not every article has to be critical in nature, I appreciate the update. Reply 0 7 sam November 2, 2016 10:01 am I don’t know how many people are going to bother to test on Samsung Internet when they have to buy a Samsung phone first; at best, it comes off as naïve, and at worst it’s an attempt to bully money out of authors with an Apple- or Microsoft-style closed-ecosystem play. (‘Nice website you’ve got there. It’d be a real shame for you if it rendered poorly on millions of users’ default browsers. You’re lucky that our phones are only a few hundred dollars, aren’t you?’) If Samsung want to be good citizens and a part of the open web, publicly releasing the browser for other platforms for testing purposes should be the top priority. Until then, it really shouldn’t be surprising if people don’t take Samsung Internet seriously, no matter what its technical merits are. Reply 0 8 John Smith November 4, 2016 10:08 pm If they want to be a good citizen, they should just make Chrome the easy and obvious browser and not introduce a vendor specific browser into the mix. They can contribute to Chrome or Mozilla if they think they actually can add benefit. Right now, they are just trying to control people who buy the Galaxy phones. and no, Web developers should not jump through hoops to support “all the different version of Chromia” Reply 0 Leave a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

One of the new things that didn’t get shown off was a redesigned dialer app. The Pixel dialer is an updated version of the Google Phone app exclusively for the Pixel phones (for now). If you have an Android 6.0+ phone, you may be able to try it out right now. To install the new Pixel dialer, you will need a phone that is compatible with the Google Phone app. If you can install the Google Phone from the Play Store, you will be able to install the Pixel launcher. The next thing you will need is the Pixel launcher APK, which can be found at APKMirror as the latest version of Google Phone. Just install it as an update to the Google Phone app. The go into Settings > Apps and make sure it is the default “Phone app.” So what’s different in this version? The main menu looks very similar, but when you are in a call things look different. The call screen shows your wallpaper with a blue filter over the top. Incoming calls show the caller’s contact photo as the answer/reject button. You swipe up to answer, swipe down to reject.

By Jenny McGrath — October 9, 2016 11:27 AM Subscribe to this topic Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends At Google’s media event on October 4, we got a lot more details about Google Home, the Amazon Echo-like speaker that promises to keep your life organized, play music from almost any streaming service, search for answers to your questions, work in tandem with Chromecast to display photos and videos on your TV, and control your smart home. While Home’s assistant might have some advantages over Amazon’s Alexa — for example, it will give you a detailed answer on how to clean up a wine stain, as opposed to Alexa saying I don’t know– but Google’s new device doesn’t control nearly the amount of smart-home products that Amazon’s can. Well, at least not yet. Of course, Alexa has been integrating with partners for more than a year, and Google Home won’t arrive in stores until November 4 (you can pre-order one now for $129). Four debut partners have been announced thus far. Related: Is there an Echo in here? How Google Home compares to Amazon’s Bluetooth speaker “We’ve partnered with Nest, SmartThings, Philips Hue, and IFTTT to voice-enable your lights, switches, and thermostats. You can control individual devices, rooms, or your whole house,” said Rishi Chandra, Google’s project lead for Chromecast, at the recent media event. “We’ll be constantly adding more partners over time.” Although Nest has more than just a thermostat — the Protect is a smart smoke and carbon monoxide detector and Drop is a security camera — and Samsung’s SmartThings Kit comes with sensors in addition to a connected outlet, it sounds like Google Home won’t quite be able to interact with these devices yet. But you can say, “OK Google, set my thermostat to 70 degrees,” and the assistant will take care of it on your behalf. If you’re hoping Google Home will be an alternative smart home controller capable of competing with Alexa or HomeKit, you may have to wait a while until more partners come on board. We’ll also have to see what role Thread, the Google-backed mesh network protocol, will play. Related: Every device that connects to Amazon’s Alexa Right now, the Home’s most intriguing feature is the baked-in assistant, which can answer pretty complicated questions and use context clues to respond to follow-ups. It can also interact with Google’s Chromecast, meaning you can ask Home to play YouTube videos or put up your photos on your TV if you’ve already opted for the $35 device. The audio version can play music on speakers throughout your house. Considering it’s $40 less than the Amazon Echo, the Home may be an attractive option for a voice-controlled assistant, especially for Android users who get added benefits, like shopping lists they can vocally add items to that then show up on their phones.

The company has discontinued production and recalled all devices - whether they are an original model or a replacement. In fact, anyone using a Galaxy Note 7 is urged to switch it off immediately and bring it in for a refund. Read More Samsung scraps Galaxy Note7 and tells customers to switch off handsets - Here's what to do if you own one in the UK The Note 7 was intended to be an all-singing, all-dancing flagship handset from the South Korean manufacturer to go up against the iPhone 7 Plus. It boasted key features like waterproofing, a screen resolution high enough for VR and an improved S Pen stylus. Unfortunately, it was also liable to explode. If you've already invested in a Note 7 then, understandably, you're likely to be looking about for a suitable alternative. And if you've been considering the Note 7 then chances are you're going to be looking elsewhere too. Read More Samsung stops ALL sales of Galaxy Note 7 after reports of replacement phones catching fire Thankfully, there are a number of decent phones around at the moment that can offer a viable alternative to Samsung's fiery gadget. 1. Google Pixel XL REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach The Google Pixel phone is displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco Fresh off the pipeline from Google HQ, the Pixel XL isn't available to buy in the UK until October 20. But it has a unique set of features that make it a prime alternative to the Note 7. Firstly, it runs the same software (Android) but because it comes directly from Google is the most up-to-date version available. And because it's from the search giant itself, it'll be first in line for updates down the road. Read More Google Pixel: How much space do you REALLY get on the new 32GB smartphone? The sizings and specs are similar too. The Note 7 has a 5.7-inch screen while the Pixel XL comes close at 5.5-inches. They both have 4GB of RAM and a 12MP rear-facing camera. Sadly, the Pixel XL is a touch more expensive than the Note 7 was. While Samsung's phone cost £630 for the 32GB model, Google's option is £720. And if you want to go up to 128GB you're looking at £820. Ouch. 2. Apple iPhone 7 Plus Getty Images Customers try out the new iPhone 7 If Samsung has burned its bridges with you, then there's always the option to go over to Apple's side. Despite the fact it dropped the 3.5mm headphone jack, Apple's phone has been met with largely positive reviews. Read More Samsung halts Galaxy Note 7 production after multiple reports of replacement phones catching fire It has a much-improved dual-lens camera capable of optical zoom and an updated waterproof body - just like the Note 7. You can read our full review of the iPhone 7 Plus here . But not only will you have to switch from Android to iOS, you'll also have to pay the same kinds of prices as the Pixel XL above. The iPhone 7 Plus starts at £719 for 32GB and goes up to £819 for 128GB before topping out at £919 for the 256GB version. 3. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Jeff Parsons You can fit a lot of app shortcuts on that 5.5-inch screen If Samsung is where your heart is, then it's perhaps a good idea to go back to the company's earlier phone from 2016. The Galaxy S7 edge has a 5.5-inch display, 4GB of RAM and an impressive curved-screen design that won it plenty of praise when it was revealed. So far, the 3600mAh battery hasn't shown any of the same problems that the Note 7 has.

Is another operating system what consumers need? Many people think so. https://t.co/GFPr02ruE7 — Ali Zartash-Lloyd (@Cognisant2000) October 7, 2016 Andromeda reportedly is a mashup of Android and Chrome, with features from Chrome having been ported into Android rather than the other way around. It's expected to show up next year in a new laptop, dubbed "Pixel 3," Android Police reported last month. The project is known internally as "Bison." Putting It Together Andromeda apparently is distinct from Google's current bid to bring Android apps to Chromebooks through the App Runtime for Chrome project, and the Pixel 3 won't be marketed as a Chromebook. Google also plans to launch a Huawei-manufactured Nexus tablet that will run Andromeda, 9to5 Google reported last month. A Chrome and Android mashup would provide "a common platform across all devices that includes not only the OS but the browser functions as well," observed Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "It's what Microsoft was trying to do before the government told them they couldn't," he told TechNewsWorld. Reaching for Andromeda Google has been "on a trajectory to hybridize Android and Chrome OS in terms of running apps, the Web/Touch model and other aspects," noted Al Hilwa, a research program director at IDC. "I'm not surprised to see Andromeda devices," he told TechNewsWorld. This move "is essentially what we've said all along Google should do," Hilwa remarked. "Clearly they can only do it at a certain pace, given that these are established platforms with OEM ecosystems." The pace has been fairly sedate for Google. Executive chairman Eric Schmidt appeared to hint at the hybridization in his keynote at the 2011 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Chrome and Android would have more features in common, Schmidt said two years later, though Google intended to keep the OSes separate. Those comments followed Android guru Andy Rubin's move from the Android unit to head unspecified new projects. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who was then head of the Chrome OS unit, was Rubin's replacement. That move increased speculation that Google was planning an eventual merger of the two OSes. Hardware Expectations Andromeda "will optimize access to Google Assistant from hybrid PCs and tablets," suggested Werner Goertz, a research director at Gartner. However, Google's new Allo chat app and its new Pixel hardware devices will be more relevant, he told TechNewsWorld ahead of last week's event, as they're integrated with Google Assistant. They "will form the starting point for a new ecosystem for Google's virtual personal assistant," Goertz noted. "As such, Google's strategy resembles that of Amazon with Alexa." The Pixel 3, slated for release next year, will be an ultra-thin laptop with a 12.3-inch display, Android Police reported. It's expected to have a tablet mode, but whether it will be a 2-in-1 device like Microsoft's Surface Book or have some other form factor is unknown. It will have an Intel M3 or i5 Core processor with 32 or 128 GB of storage and 8 GB or 16 GB of RAM, according to Android Police. It also will have a fingerprint scanner, two USB C ports, a 3.5 mm jack, stylus support, stereo speakers, quad mikes, and a backlit keyboard with a glass trackpad employing haptic tech and force detection. Battery life is expected to be about 10 hours. Richard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to.

People Sue Nonexistent Individuals to Trick Google into Censoring Search Results GO SEO companies find new trick to remove bad press from Google Oct 11, 2016 12:20 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Companies and individuals have filed dozens of defamation lawsuits against nonexisting persons, which, after a complicated legal procedure, led judges to issue court orders that force online platforms such as Google, Yelp, and others to remove bad reviews or negative articles. This new legal trick to censor bad press on the Internet came to light following an investigation by The Washington Post (WP), which uncovered 25 suspicious cases. The common theme in all cases was that the lawsuit's defendant was not a real person, which WP validated with the help of a private investigator. Lawyers find clever (probably illegal) trick to censor Google, Yelp Plaintiffs had filed lawsuits for defamatory comments and defamation claims against nonexistent persons, who then "mysteriously" agreed for an injunction on their comments or articles. Faced with a quick resolution to the case, judges would approve the self-agreed injunction and put out a court order to have the web page taken down. The plaintiff would then take this court order and pass it on to Google or Yelp, who acted on it and removed the content from their search results and site. Internet companies furiously fight against illegal takedown notices, but when the takedown notice is accompanied by an "official" court order, they trust that the judge has made the right decision. SEO reputation management company tied to many lawsuits Here's a case example, detailed by WP. Matthew Chan of Georgia posted a bad review of Mitul Patel's dental practice on Yelp. Patel sued a man called Matthew Chan from Baltimore, Maryland, who had signed a self-injunction, and the judge issued a court order for Yelp to take down the content. But the catch is that, according to the WP, there is no person named Matthew Chan living in Baltimore. The Washington Post says it found several similar cases filed in courts in California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Evidence links some of these cases to Richart Ruddie, owner of RIR 1984 LLC, SEO Profile Defense Network LLC, and Profile Defenders, companies that provide reputation management contracts. Below is a video from the Profile Defenders website advertising some of the company's mysterious "reputation management" practices. #SEO#lawsuit#bad press#censorship#search engine results subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Facebook Workplace Allows Companies to Build Their Own Facebook-like Intranet French Company Sues Apple Because of Improper HTML5 Support in iOS Google, Microsoft, Facebook, IBM, and Amazon Launch Initiative to Regulate AI Music Labels Sue Top YouTube-to-MP3 Service 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android Ubuntu Touch OTA-14 Slightly Delayed, New Task Manager Gets Fuzzy Background    Companies find a new legal trick to censor search results and bad reviews Related Apps AccessToFile: Export Access data to several output formats by turning to this lightweight application that features a session manager and a task scheduler VidMasta: Now you can watch and download movies as well as television titles in any format (TV, DVD, 720p, 1080i/p) with the help of this simple utility Remote Desktop Manager Enterprise Edition: Easily manage remote connections and virtual machines, while accessing your data from an offline location or browse cloud repositories Wonder Lister: A useful application for the eBay users who need to manage their products, offers, inventory and sales by using an online client MyToTxt: Export data from MySQL databases to multiple document formats, schedule tasks and perform batch operations, with this handy application Advanced ETL Processor Enterprise: Automate complicated business processes and perform complex data validation with ease, thanks to this effective and straightforward utility ProgDVB Professional: Watch TV channels from around the world, listen to radio station from the comfort of your computer, and record your favorite shows to watch them later Reader comments Twitter Down for Some Users - Update: It's Back more on: Twitter i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg Korean company buys startup Viv to make its own digital helper Android chief says phone makers ‘may want to differentiate’ Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Google just debuted a digital assistant, which it hopes to place inside smartphones, watches, cars and every other imaginable internet-connected device. It’s already hit a snag. The Alphabet Inc. division launched new smartphones last week with the artificially intelligent assistant deeply embedded. It also rolled out a speaker with the feature at its core and announced plans to let other companies tie their apps and services to the assistant. A day later, Samsung Electronics Co., one of the largest manufacturers of smartphones and other consumer devices, said it was acquiring Viv Labs, a startup building its own AI voice-based assistant.  At first, the deal looked like a counter-punch to Samsung rival Apple Inc. -- Viv is run by the creators of Apple’s Siri assistant. But buying Viv may be more of a problem for Google, because Samsung is the biggest maker of phones running Google’s Android mobile operating system. Google strategy is now centered on the assistant, rather than its search engine, because it’s a more natural way for people to interact with smartphones and other connected devices. Getting all Android phone makers to put the Google assistant on their devices would get the technology into millions of hands quickly. But Samsung’s Viv deal suggests assistants are too important for phone makers to let other companies supply this feature. Last week, Samsung executive Injong Rhee said the company plans to put Viv’s technology in its smartphones next year and then embed it into other electronics and home appliances. A Samsung representative and a Google spokeswoman declined to comment. That’s a necessity for Samsung, according to some analysts and industry insiders. "As AI is becoming more sophisticated and valuable to the consumer, there’s no question it will be important for hardware companies," said Kirt McMaster, executive chairman of Cyanogen Inc., a startup that makes Android software. McMaster, a frequent Google critic, said other Android handset makers will likely follow Samsung’s move.  "If you don’t have an AI asset, you’re not going to have a brain," he added. Google may already have known that some Android phone makers -- known as original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs -- were reluctant to embrace its assistant. "Other OEMs may want to differentiate" Google’s Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer told Bloomberg before it released its own smartphones. "They may want to do their own thing -- their own assistant, for example." Samsung and Google have sparred in the past over distribution. Google requires Android handset makers to pre-install 11 apps, yet Samsung often puts its own services on its phones. And the South Korean company has released devices that run on its own operating system, called Tizen, not Android. Keeping Up Viv was frequently on the short-list of startups that could help larger tech companies build assistant technology. Founded four-years ago by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham, the startup was working on voice technology to handle more complex queries than existing offerings.  While it drummed up considerable attention and investment, Viv has not yet released its product to the public. And some analysts are skeptical of Samsung’s ability to convert the technology into a credible service, given its mixed record with software applications. "It will be very hard to compete with Google’s strength in data and their AI acquisitions,” said Jitendra Waral, senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. "Samsung would need to prove that its AI solutions are superior to that of Google’s. They are handicapped in this race.” Samsung is also focused on handling the fallout from its exploding Galaxy Note 7 phones, potentially taking management time away from its Viv integration. But it’s a race Samsung has to join. In recent years, Samsung acquired mobile-payments and connected-device startups to keep up with Apple, Google and Amazon.com Inc. Digital voice-based assistants may be more important, if they become the main way people interact with devices. Silicon Valley titans are rushing into the space because of this potential. Amazon is trying to sign up developers for its Alexa voice technology. Apple has recently touted more Siri capabilities and opened the technology to other developers. And now Google, considered the leader in artificial intelligence, is making its own push. "I don’t ever remember a time when every single major consumer tech company -- and even enterprise companies -- have been singularly focused on an identical strategy," said Tim Tuttle, chief executive officer of MindMeld Inc., a startup working on voice interaction software. "They’re all following the exact same playbook.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

When Apple launched Siri in 2011, in the midst of all round excitement, everyone began tapping the home screen, asking random questions, just to grin as the answers were delivered in a robot monotone. Google Now, Google's answer to Siri, was launched a couple of years later, and Amazon has joined the bandwagon with Alexa, a virtual assistant that exists without a screen. Google has recently unveiled the Google Assistant, a chat bot that lets you do everything Google Now used to, from finding out the score of the latest game to setting an alarm to wake up at 6 in the morning. Are these virtual assistants really efficient at sorting out queries? Is it used by most people using these devices? What do people mostly use the virtual assistants for? IT professional Mayank Shankar says, “I have had Siri on for almost four years on my Iphone and have not used it for anything beyond setting alarms or typing a message occasionally. It often does not understand what I am trying to say and this makes it tough for me to assign larger tasks. I think that once wearable technology makes its way to popular usage, virtual office assistants may be used more.” Ad professional Siddharth S agrees, “I think everyone was really excited about virtual assistants when Siri was launched. The novelty was a major factor when Google launched Google Now as well. That is no longer the case. I would much prefer a chat interface that lets me delegate tasks than something that has me screaming over the phone to a machine that does not quite often understand my accent. I tend to use it only when I am not in a crowd. I feel stupid talking to my phone in public.” Engineer Harish Singh does not agree. “I can dial anyone on my phone book by just shouting out the name on Google Now, find out the weather in my location and open the app of my choice without bothering to type anything or swipe through multiple screens. I find it as normal as googling to find out the results of the latest game.” Using a voice assistant is a matter of convenience for bank official Ranjit Biswas. “I feel it makes things easier when you can just press the home button from the lock screen and command Siri to do a variety of things or look up something on Google or answer a question on something like Quora or search the web. Although you could download the apps and use it, it requires unlocking your phone, finding the app, tapping on it, waiting for it to load, and then performing your desired function either by typing or speaking. Being able to skip all that by holding the home button for a second and then speaking is much better.” Creative Strategies, a company that tracks industry trends, conducted a number of studies on how consumers were using these virtual assistants and how they really feel about it. The studies revealed that 21 per cent of those surveyed never used Siri, 43 per cent never touched OK Google and 72 per cent have never asked Cortana(Microsoft) anything. It also said that most consumers used it only during driving and those who never used a voice assistant were uncomfortable talking to their devices in public. It does seem that as hands-free technology and wearables increase, home automation becomes more common and internet coverage becomes more widespread in India, voice assistants will become commonplace.

Google Already Spent $3.2 Million on Advertisement for its Pixel Smartphones GO The tech giant spent the money on TV videos Oct 11, 2016 11:48 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google unveiled its latest smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, last week and the company is working hard on advertising the phones and attracting customers. It seems that it has already spent millions on TV ads and other campaigns. Reuters reported that the tech giant spent $3.2 million on television ads in the past few days and the company might spend even more. Verizon, the US carrier that exclusively sells Pixel phones, might spend several millions more in order to promote them. Google will be directly competing against the biggest smartphone makers out there in a race to take up market share that Samsung is currently losing after word got out that the Galaxy Note 7 is discontinued. When it comes to Android-running smartphones, Pixel and Pixel XL are definitely some of the best options out there and even come with a smaller price than the Note 7. Google might buy ads during Thanksgiving football games Many consumers might take their full refunds for the Note 7 and purchase a Pixel phone, considering that the price for the smartphone offered by Google is approximately $200 lower than for Samsung’s latest flagship. For Android users, the Pixel is definitely a good option, while those who wish to switch to another OS altogether, might pick up the latest iPhone. Analysts have stated that Google might buy ads during Thanksgiving football games, which could cost around a million dollars. Seeing how the holiday season is approaching, Google will make sure that Pixel phones are a viable option for consumers. Google officials did say that the company would be conducting a “very significant marketing campaign”. Pixel smartphones will be available at Verizon starting October 20, while pre-orders are already live. Google is expected to sell about 4 million Pixel smartphones this year and the number might increase, given that the Galaxy Note 7 is no longer a competitor.

 Google reportedly aims to start building its new London mega office by the end of 2017 Sam Shead Oct. 11, 2016, 7:31 AM 1,490 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google has moved hundreds of employees into 6 Pancras Square.BNP Paribas Google is planning to start building its new, heavily delayed UK headquarters before the end of 2017, Bloomberg reports. The search giant is currently looking for a construction company to build the new London offices, according to the Bloomberg report, which cites two sources who say the project has been "revived," without specifying who the new architect is. Google first announced the $1 billion (£820 million) property back in January 2013, saying it hoped to complete the complex by 2016. The company then scrapped the initial architect's plans, which included a rooftop running track and a swimming pool, because they were "too boring." After pushing back the construction date, Google took a lease on another property in King's Cross at 6 Pancras Square, possibly to bridge the gap and move some employees out of its existing offices across the city. The technology company has also quietly snapped up at least two smaller plots in the King's Cross area. Google did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

Those days are coming to an end. Although smartphones and social media remain as important as ever, the war to control those platforms are over. Winners are being coronated as the losers are, at last, conceding. Microsoft plans to unload what’s left of its Nokia purchase, and BlackBerry—remember them?—is abandoning the hardware business. That essentially ends the smartphone wars, leaving iOS and Android as the dominant operating systems. Now, Twitter’s ongoing woes suggest the end of the social platform wars are nigh. Twitter stocks jumped last month amid rumors of a sale, with Google, Apple, and Salesforce cited as suitors. Now it appears they’ve all jilted the company, and its stock tumbled to below pre-rumor levels. There are many reasons the titans of tech would pass. Twitter isn’t growing fast enough, it doesn’t make enough money, and it is overrun by trolls, morons, and bullies. And those are the big problems. But the fact no one seems to want one of the world’s most influential social platforms says something about how the landscape has changed. The Social Craze Facebook wasn’t the first social network, but its success heralded the age of Social Everything, just as the iPhone luanched Mobile Mania. Countless social networks appeared, catering to every niche. Even the most boring companies got in on things. IBM, SAP, Salesforce, and Tibco released corporate social networking tools, and Microsoft snapped up Yammer (“Twitter for work”) for $1.2 billion and LinkedIn for $26.2 billion. Everything from help desk software to video streaming sites tapped into social networks. The prevailing wisdom of the era stated that Google and Apple needed a social network to remain relevant. If people turned to Facebook instead of search engines for information, how would Google keep making money? If Google had a successful social network built into its Android operating system, who would buy an iPhone? So both companies gave it a try. Google launched Orkut, then Google Wave, then Google Buzz, then Google+. None of them took off. Apple launched the music-themed social network called iTunes Ping in 2010. It went nowhere. The missteps didn’t seem to hurt. People still use Google search. They keep buying Android phones and iPhones. Meanwhile, Facebook’s attempt at a mobile platform, Facebook Home, fizzled. No one, it seems, could make a smartphone platform and a social network and do a good job of both. What’s Next? Now everyone’s looking at what’s next. Facebook, Google, and Microsoft are competing for the nascent virtual reality market. Apple and Google just launched new messaging apps to challenge Facebook and Snapchat. Snapchat is making smartglasses. Amazon and Google are making–of all things–smart speakers. Business software startups are building Slack apps instead of mobile apps. Companies are investing millions–billions, probably–into artificial intelligence, robotics and drones. Yes, buying Twitter could still make sense for Apple or Google. Either company could expand Twitter’s user base by baking Twitter into its mobile devices. Either could drive revenue selling Twitter ads through its existing ad network. But their lack of interest suggests both companies are moving beyond the social wars. Buying Twitter would be a throwback to the recent past, not a step toward the future. Go Back to Top.

Amber Neben, who at the age of four survived a bout of spinal meningitis which left her in a coma for three days and doctors fearing brain damage if she survived, has become a double world champion. It was a stunning performance and completes an incredible year for US women’s time trialling, after Kristin Armstrong’s gold in Rio. Ellen van Dijk came up just short yet again, but her epic battle with Neben was the highlight of the race. Katrin Garfoot found something in the final couple of kilometres to win bronze, and deny Annemiek van Vleuten a fairytale medal. Thanks for your time.

Was a long wait. I think I used more energy sitting there [waiting for the other riders to finish than i did on the bike. I was so nervous. It was so hard to watch. I feel for Ellen but am so excited for myself. The difference today was the mental perserverence. This one was more special because of everything that has happened between 2008 and now.” Updated at 9.29am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.23am EDT 09:23 Amber Neben wins gold That’s it. Van der Breggen finishes a catastrophic ride two min 11sec behind the new world champion. What a ride from the American, who won this title eight years ago and was not thought to be among the contenders at the age of 41. Final standings: 1) Neben (US) 2) Van Dijk (Neth) 3) Garfoot (Aus) Updated at 9.41am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.21am EDT 09:21 Brennauer trails home in sixth Neben is almost there. She can afford to smile now. Another of her potential rivals cannot match her time, and does not even make the medals. Brennauer will be disappointed with that Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.18am EDT 09:18 Garfoot moves into bronze medal position Garfoot finishes strongly and takes third position, for now at least. She dug deep there in the late stages to go one better than her fourth in this race last year. Zabelinskaya fades into fourth, and Amialiusik has dropped out of the picture. Updated at 9.31am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.07am EDT 09:07 Garfoot and Zabelinskaya the remaining challengers The four-rider threat to the gold medal seems to be down to two. Brennauer, like Van der Breggen, is struggling badly. Garfoot and Zabelinskaya are holding their form well, but nobody knows how much it is taking out of them to stay up with pace. Or how fast Neben went over the second half of the race. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.00am EDT 09:00 Van der Breggen miles off the pace Anna van der Breggen, supposedly the favourite for this race, is a huge 24 seconds off the lead at the first time check. Is she suffering in the heat? We haven’t mentioned that for a while. It’s the action that’s reaching boiling point. Garfoot and Zabelinskaya are 10sec behind Neben, Brennauer a further 3sec back. Neben looks comfortable at the finish right now, but further ahead the Belarusian Alena Amialiusik is on the move. Could she be a surprise medal threat? Updated at 9.02am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.49am EDT 08:49 Battle for medals There are probably only four women who can deny Neben now, and they are taking to the track. The German-born Australia’s Katrin Garfoot won the Chrono Champenois, the dress rehearsal for this event, last month. The Russian Olga Zabelinskaya won silver in the Rio Olympic time trial, after returning from a doping ban. Germany’s Lisa Brennauer won the world title in 2014. And Anna van der Breggen of the Netherlands has probably been the most impressive female time triallist this season. They are all on the track now, their task; to disrupt the current top three: 1) Neben: 36:37.04 2) Van Dijk +6sec 3) Van Vleuten +25sec Updated at 8.51am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.36am EDT 08:36 Van Dijk moves into second after nearly falling Van Dijk is hurting. She is rocking on the bike, shoulders weaving from side to side. She does not look comfortable and she nearly falls off. Has it cost her? Yes! She finishes 5.99sec off Neben. She’s in silver position, but that won’t please her. She wanted gold, and gave everything out there. But it wasn’t enough. Can Neben hold on for the title? Updated at 8.38am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.31am EDT 08:31 Van Dijk slips behind Neben’s pace again This really is a see-saw tussle, potentially for gold. At the 2km to go mark Van Dijk and Neben are dead level. This is a very flat course but there is a bit of a drag up to the finish. Can she find that last drop of energy to pull her through at the top? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.25am EDT 08:25 Hayley Simmonds making slow inroads Britain’s Hayley Simmonds was seen as an outside contender for a medal before the race, but has struggled so far. She was 18th quickest at the first check and 13th at the second, but surely is too far off the pace to have a say in this. The current standings are: 1) Neben: 36:37.04 2) Van Vleuten +25sec 3) Worrack +1.11sec Hayley Simmonds competes during the Women’s Elite Individual Time Trial Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images Updated at 8.42am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.21am EDT 08:21 Van Dijk on the charge Van Dijk’s attempt to better Neben’s time is turing into an epic battle. The American went off very quickly and seemed to pay a little in the closing stages, and the latest unofficial split suggests the Dutch rider is 4sec inside the leader’s time. Van Dijk ended up in the gutter at the Rio 2016 time trial after the wind took her front wheel when she was going well. But she redeemed herself at the European road championships, where she won the individual time trial ahead of Van der Breggen and Rio bronze medallist Olga Zabelinskaya. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.11am EDT 08:11 Mid-race recap A few moments to take stock after three of the heavweights made their mark on the race. There are some suggestions that the wind was favourable for the trio and if that was the case then maybe those times will take some beating. That said there are some serious medal contenders and one of those, Ellen van Dijk, sped off from the start and looked to be threatening the lead. By the first official split she was six seconds off the pace though. Neben’s mark is getting better by the second. Updated at 8.12am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.56am EDT 07:56 Neben takes the lead from Van Vleuten Worrack posts the fastest time but that is surpassed moments later by Van Vleuten, and then almost immediately surpassed again by Neben. Van Vleuten fiinshed strongly to lie second as things stand and can be pleased with her efforsts after Rio. but the story of the day so far is Amber Neben. The 41-year-old American’s time is 25 sec better than her Dutch rival, and 1min 11sec quicker than Worrack. Hannah Barnes is out of the medals now, another minute further back.

Trixi Worrack is another whose form is difficult to measure because of a serious injury earlier this year. The German underwent emergency kidney surgery on her left kidney in Varese, Italy, after crashing during a Women’s WorldTour event in March but she is a fantastic time triallist. Unfortunately she is being blown away by the relentless Neben at the time check six kilometres from home: Neben leads by 30 sec from Van Vleuten and 53 from Worrack. Updated at 7.45am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.32am EDT 07:32 Amber Neben goes off like a train The race is beginning to hot up now, metaphorically as well as literally, with some of the real medal contenders on the course. Trixi Worrack, the veteran German, posts a time five seconds quicker than Van Vleuten at the the first time check, but both are currently being put in the shade by Amber Neben, who is going even quicker and is leading at the first and second splits. Could the Neben at 41 do a Kristin Armstrong, who claimed the time trial gold in Rio at the age of 43? These Americans seem to be getting better with age.

Immediately her average speed is above 50kph, almost five seconds faster than the current leader Barnes. Van Vleuten is an unknown quantity after the horror injuries she suffered only two months ago, but she has talent.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.07am EDT 07:07 Hannah Barnes takes the lead The British rider looked to be struggling in the closing stages but found something in the last couple of kilometres to post the quickest time so far. Barnes’s mark of 39min 00.37sec is eight seconds better than that of the Dane Julie Leth, who didn’t look to be going particularly quickly but held her form well. Obviously the race is seeded so the big guns will all go later, but that’s an impressive run and a decent early barometer.

Updated at 6.49am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.38am EDT 06:38 Temperature check So the temperature in Doha currently stands at …. a balmy 39C. This is not going to be pretty, and one by product of the searing heat, apart from the physical toll on the riders, is the lack of fans around the course. Supporters were conspicuous by their absence at the team time trial on Sunday, and the Pear Qatar resembles a ghost town once again. It’s simply too hot to leave the confines of the air conditioned five star hotels. Even the wind could burn the riders today. This doesn’t bode well for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Updated at 6.45am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.43am EDT 10:43 Preamble Those fancy Russian bears and their leaky data have cast cycling into a rather murky light recently. The revelations of Bradley Wiggins’s TUEs have quite rightly given rise to ethical discussions about the use of legal substances to maximise performance, but once again the sport is under the spotlight for the wrong reasons. Step forward Annemiek van Vleuten, who could lift everyone’s spirits with a fairytale win in today’s women’s individual time trial. The dutch rider was on course for Olympic gold in the road race in Rio eight weeks ago when a horrific crash on the final descent shattered her hopes of victory and almost cost her her life. Van Vleuten was rushed to hospital and spent time in intensive care, having suffered severe concussion and three cracks in her spine. A long period of recovery may have been expected, but Van Vleuten won the Lotto Belgium Tour a month after Rio, and now has her sights firmly set on Doha. The flat course in the road race means her best shot of gold may come in today’s time trial, the event in which she reclaimed her national title this year, but the competition is fierce. Kristin Armstrong, who claimed the time trial gold in Rio at the age of 43, and the reigning world champion Linda Villumsen are not here, but Anna van der Breggen of the Netherlands is in ominous form. Van der Bruggen profited from Van Vleuten’s fall to win road race gold in Rio, and was second behind Villumsen in this event last year in Virginia. A third dutchwoman, Ellen van Dijk, also has a point to prove. Katrin Garfoot, the current Australian and Oceania time trial champion, is dangerous, while the Germans, Lisa Brennauer and Trixi Worrack, and Russia’s Olga Zabelinskaya have some pedigree. Great Britain’s Hayley Simmonds has been breaking all manner of national records recently. This could be very close. All the talk so far in Doha has been about the searing heat, with riders losing control or being violently sick as temperatures rose close to 40C in Sunday’s team time trial. Today’s 28.9km route is made up of two loops on the Pearl Qatar, the artificial island on the east coast of Qatar, with three time checks on the way.

Close Email This Story Send Email Cancel A project to set up virtual reality cameras in classrooms so students can remotely view the class using their smartphones won a 2016 Strategic Innovation Award. The project was started by the university’s media specialist Nicholas La Joie. La Joie said the idea for the project came after experiencing virtual reality through Google Cardboard for the first time. Google Cardboard is a head mount in which users put their smartphone in the back and look through lenses in the front to experience virtual reality. A year-and-a-half ago, the New York Times put out a free edition of the Google Cardboard for all of their subscribers, and it piqued La Joie’s interest. “After that experience, I was really fascinated by the idea of 360-degree immersive video,” La Joie said. “Being able to tell stories through that immersive experience was very impactful. It felt very different than watching something on a flat screen.” La Joie said he’s collaborating with Josh Grebe, a senior maintenance engineer with a background in programming, who will help set up an app that students can use to access a distant classroom. “(Grebe) said it shouldn’t be too much of an issue to write an app that could be on iOS and Android that could be downloaded by students for free,” La Joie said. “If they have a $10 pair of Google Cardboard, they would be able to access a classroom that has a 360-degree camera and experience the class as though they were there.” The project is still waiting on a virtual reality camera to arrive from a company named Orah, Grebe said. The camera can livestream 360-degree video in high definition. “The camera is kind of the all-in-one solution,” Grebe said. “You can put the camera in the middle of the room and then there’s a box that makes the VR image and will live stream that image.” La Joie said he envisions an experience in which students could be fully immersed in the classroom. “You could look to the left and see the student next to you and if someone asks a question, you could look at them and think, ‘Oh, I recognize who that was,’” La Joie said. “If you let the users have the freedom to explore the space around them on their own, it makes them feel more implanted and participatory in that space.” La Joie said as a media specialist he spent a lot of time setting up video conferences, which helped him see the potential in distance learning. Distance learning allows students to learn even if they aren’t physically  in a classroom. “In my years of doing traditional video conferencing here, I’ve seen how distance can be bridged rather seamlessly,” La Joie said. “If a student needs to talk to someone from a class in Spain, they’ll have an experience where at first they’ll think, ‘Oh, it’s strange that I’m talking to another person on a screen.’ After a few sessions, the wall will break down and it’ll feel like you’re in the same room.” Distance learning is important because there are a variety of reasons why students might need to miss class, La Joie said. “Some people work full time or they live really far away and can’t always be here on campus,” he said. However, setting up a virtual classroom would bring another level of immersion than typical online courses, La Joie said. “One of the statistics about online classes that’s discouraging is that students that sign up for an online course that isn’t taught face to face have a very low number of students that actually finish the course,” La Joie said. “If you don’t feel like you’re part of the course like you would be in a traditional classroom, it’s a natural human response to disengage. If you can provide an experience that’s as close to being in the classroom as possible, I think that would lead to higher retention.” There is concern students could abuse the live-streaming aspect of the technology said, a professor of biomedical sciences and member of the University Innovation Council, David Becker. The council is tasked with reviewing the Strategic Innovation Fund proposals and providing feedback. “As with most technological advances, there’s both good and bad uses of it,” Becker said. “My guess is that students that view this as an alternative to actually attending class won’t benefit as much as if they actually attended class.” However, using the technology as an alternative to posting videos of lectures online could be useful, Becker said. “Often times, there’s a need for students to go over the material repeatedly and the more immersive that experience can be, the richer the learning experience,” Becker said. “I think it could be a very useful tool.” Tags: David Becker, Google Cardboard, Josh Grebe, Nicholas La Joie Leave a Comment If you want a picture to show with your comment, go get a gravatar.

The buzz around it shows that some publishers are starting to consider it as a custom yield-optimising solution in order to drive maximum return. Below we share our cautionary observations on header bidding as well as some recommendations on more feasible alternatives should you be considering taking this route. What is header bidding? Header bidding is a custom implementation through which publishers try to offer their ad inventory to multiple ad exchanges simultaneously. If an ad exchange is able to return an ad for a higher CPM than their premium campaign bookings can offer, this bid is accepted and this buyer’s ad will display. In effect, publishers that make use of this feature believe that in doing so, they are increasing their yield and thereby will improve their revenue. A response to Google Header bidding is in essence the reaction from Google’s competitors to the solutions provided within the DoubleClick stack. That is, firstly, (Enhanced) Dynamic Allocation, which allows DFP campaigns to compete with Ad Exchange Open Auction bids. Secondly, DFP First Look allows for (selected) AdX buyers to compete with DFP-guaranteed campaigns provided they meet the high floor price set in AdX. The downsides to header bidding Header bidding requires a significant number of resources for setup and maintenance - it has to be actively managed and optimised over time for best results. This means additional technical steps need to be made with an extra cost layer to the already non-transparent and long supply chain for transacting ad impressions. In short, the many phases added through header bidding are: Negotiations and signing of contract; Setup of the inventory in all SSPs; Setup of the SSPs in the adserver (hundreds of line items and price buckets); Implementation of the header bidding scripts; Maintenance of all the SSPs. If the setup is done incorrectly, the delivery of your direct campaigns could be jeopardised. Additionally, if poorly implemented, header bidding can add latency and cause delays to your site load times. This impacts the user experience which in turn puts the performance of the ads at risk and thereby devalues the publisher’s inventory. There is also a potential impact on the the viewability of ads, which can devalue the ad inventory even more. Header bidding can also impact a publisher’s Google ranking. A lower Google ranking means that the publisher may experience a decrease in traffic as the website is no longer top of the Google search results. In other words, header bidding, while implemented to increase yield and revenue, could potentially do the exact opposite. This is a huge risk and one that many publishers are simply not willing to take. Last but not least, header bidding only provides a limited solution. It does not (yet) work for mobile and video - for many publishers this is a large part of their ad inventory. Also, not every SSP offers header bidding - some do not accept external demand other than theirs. Some vendors may not want to participate in proprietary solutions. Header bidding, while implemented to increase yield and revenue, could potentially do the exact opposite. So why would publishers use header bidding? The main reason publishers are using header bidding is because they want to compete with Google and have DFP as a 'blocker' in the whole chain. Agencies see the header bidding trend as a way to bypass DoubleClick. Their aim is to play their own game and get closer to 'the olden days' in terms of how they bought and sold inventory. The reality is, that Google is too big a player to ignore. Ignoring Google’s solutions is naive, especially considering the limitations of and disadvantages to header bidding. Our recommendation Google offers more suitable alternatives than the complex and error-prone ‘solution’ of header bidding. Importantly, DFP First Look is being opened up for external demand, which means that publishers have access to the entire digital network without having to implement a custom solution. In addition, Google is currently working on a new solution called 'exchange bidding', soon to be released. This will allow publishers to invite trusted third-party exchanges and SSPs to submit real-time prices using industry-standard RTB calls. These prices will be considered along with bids from the DoubleClick Ad Exchange and the publisher’s reservation campaigns to pick the highest-paying ad. Whilst header bidding needs to be implemented (hard coded) on the page, Google's solutions are directly integrated within the GPT tags. This means the feature will be enabled inside DFP and there will be no latency. Billing and reporting will also be integrated within the DFP UI, allowing for easy navigation and transparency. It is our recommendation to steer away from custom solutions such as header bidding since the different DoubleClick products (AdX, DFP) are seamlessly integrated to offer publishers the same thing: optimised yield and the most revenue for their inventory. If you, like us, believe in using no more than one SSP, header bidding will give you limited advantages. In cooperation with Google, DQ&A continues to help publishers get the highest yield for every impression without sacrificing user experience.

Late last month, Snapchat revealed its first hardware product, a pair of camera-equipped smart glasses known as Spectacles. Many will compare Spectacles to Google Glass, but I encourage you to resist the urge. While a healthy bit of skepticism is warranted, Spectacles are quite different from Google's high-tech specs; if anything, they are more akin to a GoPro. Spectacles will also only set you back $130 whereas Google Glass cost $1,500. Most importantly, in the eyes of its target demographic, Snapchat—now known as Snap Inc. as it moves beyond its core app—is much cooler than Google. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel recounted using an early Spectacles prototype during a 2015 hike. "When I got the footage back and watched it, I could see my own memory, through my own eyes—it was unbelievable," he told the paper. "It's one thing to see images of an experience you had, but it's another thing to have an experience of the experience. It was the closest I'd ever come to feeling like I was there again." Anyone who has used a GoPro understands the value of this statement. Kids record themselves skateboarding, bike riding, hiking, skiing, snowbarding, swimming, and more. We may as well rename them The Capture Generation. It's the demographic that Snap understands and, as this chart shows, courts. However, I suspect an older demographic will be interested in Spectacles, too. Boomers are active picture takers and having a real-time video camera on their person would give them more flexibility in what they capture. They also have more travel and leisure time. Personally, I often see interesting things in my travels that I neglect to capture, so having a quick tap-to-record device constantly at the ready would be quite useful. //Related Articles Spectacles Are the Missing Piece of Snapchat's Business Model But Spectacles could have a more practical purpose as personal dashcams of sorts. The fixed positions of actual dashcams make them relatively limited. But if I were wearing Spectacles, I'd get a more accurate view of my surroundings. It could even be of use for law enforcement. It can be difficult to predict how a specific piece of hardware will perform in the market. That being said, the concept is sound and having a capture device that looks like something most of us already wear—sunglasses—and less like, well, Google Glass, is a good first step. You can bet that other companies will follow with more stylish alternatives or team with Snap Inc. on various design options. Still, hardware is hard. Snap Inc. will need to pull together a polished team before we take Spectacles more seriously.

Pocket-lint Sections App Camera Car Drone Fitness Tracker Gadgets Games Headphone Laptop Parenting Phone Smart Home Smartwatch Speaker Tablet TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: What's the difference? Adrian Willings11 October 2016TV Pocket-lint/Google/Roku Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment The Google Chromecast Ultra was recently announced and is set to be available to buy from November. With 4K streaming and HDR picture quality it's going to be a good alternative to the Roku Premiere+. To help you decide which one is the best choice for you, read on as we go into the differences between the Google Chromecast Ultra and Roku Premiere+. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Design With the Chromecast Ultra, Google isn't changing much in terms of design. Anyone acquainted with the Chromecast range will note the familiar shape of this circular streaming device. Unlike the Chromecast 2, the Chromecast Ultra is only available in black – lemon and coral are no longer an option. There's a gloss finish, but otherwise the Chromecast Ultra keeps the tried and tested frame. The Chromecast Ultra tucks away neatly behind your television and only the charging cable and Ethernet cable (should you choose to use one) will be visible. Meanwhile, the Roku Premiere+ makes its appearance in a sleek black unit that harks to the traditional set top box style. At 124.5 x 124.5 x 21.6mm, the Roku Premiere+ still packs a lot of smart technology in a small package, but it won't be as well hidden behind your television, nor will you necessarily want it to be. The included point anywhere remote does offer the advantage of not requiring line-of-sight placement however, unlike most of the other devices in the Roku range. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Hardware When it comes to hardware, both the Google Chromecast Ultra and Roku Premiere+ offer relatively similar specs; both will stream 4K and include HDR picture quality, which lesser streaming devices will not. The Roku Premiere+ boasts 60 fps streaming and upscaling of 720p and 1080p content to 4K on capable Ultra HD televisions. Meanwhile, the Chromecast Ultra also supports Dolby Vision which the Roku Premiere+ does not. Google says the Chromecast Ultra is 1.8 times faster than the previous models but successful streaming of 4K content will depend on the service you're getting from your ISP and whether you're using the Wi-Fi or wired connection. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Connectivity Netflix recommends 25mb/s for smooth 4K playback so you'll need a solid internet connection. You might want to consider an Ethernet connection for good quality playback without issue, especially if you suffer from Wi-Fi problems in your home. Both the Google Chromecast Ultra and Roku Premiere+ offer wired networking ports and the Chromecast Ultra includes a power adaptor Ethernet port to make this connection even easier. If you prefer Wi-Fi, the Chromecast Ultra is 802.11ac (2.4 GHz/5 GHz) capable and the Roku Premiere+ supports 802.11ac MIMO dual-band wireless. The Chromecast Ultra is powered by the familiar Micro-USB charging cable while the Roku Premiere+ has its own DC power adapter and both streaming devices connect to your television or home cinema system via standard HDMI cable. The Roku Premiere+ has the added advantage of a microSD card slot for additional channel storage. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Audio Both streaming devices are capable of delivering high-quality audio. The Google Chromecast Ultra supports surround sound output, while the Roku Premiere+ offers Dolby Audio pass-through. The Roku Premiere+ has a slight edge here with the included option of 'night listening mode' which ensures all volumes are kept level at night so there's no nasty surprises that might disturb the neighbours. Better still, the Roku Premiere+ also offers a 'private listening' option with a headphone jack built right into the remote control, so you can plug in and watch your television without any need for worrying about volume or disturbing others. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Remote control Remote control is probably the main difference with these two streaming devices and each offer their own benefits depending on how you're going to use them. The Google Chromecast Ultra is controlled via your phone or tablet using the Google Cast app available from iTunes and Google Play. The advantage the Chromecast Ultra has here is the additional ability to cast content from Chrome via a laptop or desktop machine. This gives a lot more flexibility in the type of content you can cast, as well as the method by which you do it. You can also cast content from providers like Netflix using this, meaning you can save phone battery but still access great content with ease. Meanwhile, the Roku Premiere+ is controlled using Roku's mobile app which boasts voice search capability and easy access to a wealth of content from various streaming providers. Roku also includes an advanced remote control which not only has the headphone jack we mentioned earlier, but also allows you to use it without requiring line-of-sight placement. If you're not a fan of the Roku remote, then you'll be happy to learn the that Roku Premiere+ is also compatible with a range of universal remote controls, so how you control your content is up to you. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Content Both the Google Chromecast Ultra and Roku Premiere+ offer access to a wide range of content from a variety of providers including Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Showtime and more. Roku claims you can access over 350,000 movies and TV shows while Google says they support 200,000. It is important to remember however, that the Chromecast Ultra also supports music, radio, games and a variety of different apps available via Google Play. The Roku Premiere+ has the advantage of offering Amazon Video out of the box where the Google Chromecast Ultra does not, though you can stream it using the cast functionality in Google Chrome on a laptop or desktop machine. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Price and availability The Google Chromecast Ultra is set to retail at $69/£69 when it launches in November and thus represents a great price for 4K streaming in a small but capable package. If you want a little more functionality and the addition of the robust and functional remote control, you might consider the Roku Premiere+ at the slightly higher price of $99.99. Google Chromecast Ultra vs Roku Premiere+: Which should I buy? Comparing these devices side-by-side, it's easy to see that there's not much between them. If affordability is important to you, then the Chromecast Ultra is probably the sensible choice. The Roku Premiere+ will certainly be a good alternative for people who are looking for easier content access and the simple, yet effective remote control functionality however.

Google’s new Pixel phone, which will hit stores Oct. 21, will be the first device to feature its Assistant voice service. After Amazon launched its AI voice service, Alexa, it found that people spoke to it as if it were a person. AI in its current form isn’t really artificial intelligence since the device doesn’t understand the conversation. The device interacts with its users with the help of scripted responses. Google is hiring writers from the Onion and Pixar to “infuse personality” to its voice service, Gummi Hafsteinsson, product-management director of Google Home, told WSJ Sunday. He added that Google hoped to build an emotional connection with the customer. Related Stories Google Launches More Voice Assistants Will Google Assistant Work Better than Siri? Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa already come with a repertoire of jokes. By hiring comedy writers for its Assistant, Google is looking to set itself apart with better material. According to Google’s blog, Assistant “allows you to have a natural conversation between you and Google. It’s one Assistant that’s ready to help you throughout your day.” Google Home, powered by the Google Assistant, is the company’s response to Amazon’s Echo and will be launched in November this year.

The trial is aimed at paving the way for autonomous cars to hit the roads by the end of the decade. The government is encouraging technology companies, carmakers and start-ups to develop and test their autonomous driving technologies in Britain.  Scroll down for video   A pod, like a small two-seater car, developed by a company spun out from Oxford University during testing in Milton Keynes. The government is encouraging companies to develop and test their autonomous driving technologies GOOGLE'S MINIVAN PLANS Six Chrysler Pacifica minivans have been spotted at a Google car park in Mountain View, California. Two of the white vehicles have reportedly been fitted with updated sensors, ready for road tests. The addition of the minivans marks another step in Google’s ambitions for automation and a 'commercialisation friendly' vehicle. The hope is to build an industry to serve a worldwide market which it forecasts could be worth around £900 billion ($1.1 trillion) by 2025. Earlier this year, the government launched a consultation on changes to insurance rules and motoring regulations to allow driverless cars to be used by 2020 and said it would allow such vehicles to be tested on motorways from next year. A pod, like a small two-seater car, developed by a company spun out from Oxford University was tested in Milton Keynes, with organisers hoping the trials will feed vital information on how the vehicle interacts with pedestrians and other road-users. 'Today's first public trials of driverless vehicles in our towns is a ground-breaking moment,' Britain's business minister Greg Clark said.

Share this article Share 107 shares 'The global market for autonomous vehicles present huge opportunities for our automotive and technology firms and the research that underpins the technology and software will have applications way beyond autonomous vehicles,' he said. The pod operates fully without human control, using data from cameras and radars to move around pedestrianised areas. It was made by Oxford University spin-out Oxbotica, with software developed by the university's Oxford Robotics Institute. The city, around 45 miles (70 km) north of London, was selected alongside three other locations for autonomous technology projects partly due to its wide pavements and cycle path network The pod will operate fully without human control, using data from cameras and radars to move around pedestrianised areas THE £8M GATEWAY PROJECT Gateway (Greenwich Automated Transport Environment) is an £8 million project, jointly funded by Innovate UK.  Taking place in Greenwich, the project will trial a series of different use cases for automated vehicles, including driverless shuttles, autonomous valet parking and deliveries. By understanding public perception, reaction and engagement with the vehicles the trials will help introduce automated transport widely.  The UltraPods have been operating at Terminal 5 for nearly five years, carrying 1.5 million passengers and completed three million kilometres during that time. Kit car manufacturer Westfield Sportcars will be responsible for design and testing, with Heathrow Enterprises looking after software engineering and Oxford University robotics lab spin-off Oxbotica will provide mapping and sensors to ensure safety. Carmakers Jaguar Land Rover and Ford are both part of driverless car projects in Britain, as major carmakers seek to head off the challenge from technology firms such as Alphabet Inc's Google, which is also developing autonomous vehicles. But all parties still need to overcome technological and legal obstacles including determining who would be responsible in the event of an accident, with recent accidents involving driving assistance systems raising safety concerns. Organisers in Milton Keynes ran a number of exercises ahead of the trial including mapping the town and conducting safety planning with the local council. The city, around 45 miles (70 km) north of London, was selected alongside three other locations for autonomous technology projects partly due to its wide pavements and cycle path network. The next trials will take place in Coventry, Greenwich and Bristol.  Britain is aiming to be more flexible in its approach to driverless testing than some other major economies, with Germany saying it will require black boxes to be fitted in such vehicles and automakers having to navigate different rules across US states.

Sick and tired of searching for this post? I don’t blame you. You can receive it in your inbox on Saturdays if that’s more your style. 1. Google held its annual press event where it announced a ton of new hardware, some of which people cared about, some of which people did not care about. Most buzzed about may have been Google’s new Pixel phone with flagship-level specs and the launch of the Google Home device. Google also announced its Google Assistant AI platform, the Chromecast Ultra, Google Wifi and a new very cozy-looking VR headset. Here’s a quicker recap of the highlights, but you can find full coverage here too. 2. Google wasn’t the only big tech company to hold an event this week. Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at the Oculus Developers conference to show off a taste of Facebook’s mobile VR future. He introduced a new prototype standalone headset with positional tracking, and did a cool demo of augmented social VR with facial expressions. 3. Reports said that Snap Inc., the now-parent company of Snapchat, is working on an IPO for as early as March 2017 that would value the company at $25 billion or higher. 4. Samsung acquired Viv, an AI assistant system co-founded by the creator of Siri. Viv will continue to operate as an independent company and will provide services to Samsung platforms. 5. Amazon made a big change to some of its guidelines. The company banned incentivized reviews, in an effort to make its review and rating system fairer and more in favor of the shopper. Now, Amazon – not the seller or vendor – will be the party to identify trusted reviewers, and will have a number of controls in place in order to keep bias out of the review process. 6. Facebook launched two new services. Marketplace is like a friendlier Craigslist, which lets you search for, buy and sell items. Facebook also launched its standalone Events discovery and calendar app which lets you browse and search for fun things to do in your area. 7. Trouble may be afoot at Pinterest. Last year, the search and inspiration site was projecting around $169 million in revenue for 2015. However, reports are saying that Pinterest generated only about $100 million in revenue last year. Here’s what we think might be going on. 8. Apple lost a patent retrial to patent troll notorious litigator VirtnetX regarding patents in iMessage and FaceTime services. Apple has been ordered to pay $302.4 million.  9. Meerkat, the pioneering live stream social app whose popularity was quickly eclipsed by Twitter’s Periscope, is officially no longer with us. But the company itself carries on: they’re now focusing on Houseparty, a group video chat app they’ve been building in secrecy for months. 10. Facebook launched “Messenger Day,” a feature that lets people share illustrated, filter-enhanced photos and videos that have a 24-hour lifecycle, in Poland. Sound familiar? Facebook could be using Messenger to copy Snapchat in areas where Snapchat is not yet popular. 11. Salesforce bought Krux, a traffic tracking company, for $340 million in cash plus stock. 12. Sony’s PlayStation VR is set to launch on October 13, but we got our hands on it early for a review. It may not push every technical benchmark, it’s the most accessible piece of VR hardware and is going to change the industry for good. 13. The mobile market is no longer vibrant and varied. The mobile industry has become standardized and boring. This is your weekend thought piece.  0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Snapchat Starts Selling Spectacles | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories The Down Round [Entire Series] VIDEO | 30:01 | The Down Round Zuckerberg claims 99% of Facebook posts “authentic,” denies fake news there influenced election 7 hours ago | Lora Kolodny How Facebook can escape the echo chamber 11 hours ago | Anna Escher Secret is coming back 22 hours ago | Sarah Buhr I refuse to review Snapchat Spectacles — but I’m glad to have my hands back yesterday | Matthew Panzarino Latest From TechCrunch Naver to launch $43M fund to seek out investments for its Snow and Webtoon services 25 minutes ago | Jon Russell How President Trump could abuse big data and the surveillance state 42 minutes ago | Jon Stokes How drones will reshape the enterprise 1 hour ago | Alexander Niehenke Defining our relationship with early AI 6 hours ago | Andrew Heikkila Comment moderation powered by Up Next Bumble bans mirror selfies and other dumb photos from users’ profiles Posted Oct 7, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Developer Events Content Manager (Contract Role) at Google (Mountain View, CA, United States) Director of Marketing and Communications (Position #4782) at Northern Illinois University (DeKalb, IL, United States) Digital Marketing Analyst at Stony Brook University (Stony Brook, NY, United States) Advanced TV Product Manager - Media at Time Warner Cable/Spectrum (New York, NY, United States) Technical Product Manager @ PANTHEON at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google explains why Pixel has no OIS, EIS works in 4K video JC Torres - Oct 11, 2016 7 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Just two or so years ago, very few smartphone cameras could boast of that much-desired Optical Image Stabilization component or OIS, with most falling back to electronic alternatives, or EIS. Today, however, most high-end smartphones, heck even some mid-range ones, boast of OIS left and right. So when Google’s newest darlings, the Pixel and Pixel XL, were revealed to only have EIS, despite some rather impressive output, there was naturally some amount of head scratching. Google employee “IsaacOnCamera” breaks the silence to explain what gives. In a nutshell, Google sees Optical Image Stabilization for the Pixel as overkill. Isaac starts by explaining that OIS and EIS aren’t exactly mutually exclusive but have different goals. While both do compensate for shaky hands and movement, OIS is geared more towards low-light still photography while EIS is designed better for videos. And OIS doesn’t come without a cost, says Isaac. For one, it bulks up the camera sensor. With an OIS, Google wouldn’t be able to boast how thin the Pixel is, without having a camera bump. And while OIS improves low-light photography, it does so at the expense of adding motion blur because of how it increases exposure time. Despite not having that advantage of OIS, the Pixel compensates by having a larger pixel size, which performs just as well under low light. The Pixel also has other tricks to complement this, like the always-on HDR+ mode, software algorithms, etc. Best of all, EIS works with full 4K video recording, whereas OIS usually only crops to 1080p and 720p even with a 4K capable camera sensor. As far as DxOMark is concerned, the Google Pixel has the best smartphone camera in the world. Of course, anyone and everyone will try to confirm or refute that claim. Be on the lookout for our own review of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL to see if it’s really what it’s cut out to be.

It delivered a point that Australia would have taken at half-time and one that Japan set out to achieve before kick-off. Japan were excellent in the first half, Australia poor. The Socceroos never got to grips with Japan’s concession of territory and the Blue Samurai perhaps deserved to be more than a goal up after the break. Goalscorer Haraguchi then turned from hero to villain, conceding a needless penalty early in the second half to restore Australia’s belief and shift the momentum. Thereafter, both sides probed but the clearest opportunities fell Japan’s way, though Ryan only had one decent save to make. Much will be made of Ange Postecoglou’s selections, in particular starting with two central strikers and a diamond midfield. The resulting lack of pace and width hurt Australia’s chances. The Socceroos looked much more balanced and threatening after Robbie Kruse appeared. Brad Smith stood out all night, marauding down the left hand side and offering the best of the home side’s attacking thrust. Unbeaten after four matches, and still to face whipping boys Thailand, this remains a strong start to the final World Cup qualifying phase for Australia. Tonight pitted them against a credentialed opponent that came with a defensive agenda and showed Australia a massive amount of respect. Russia 2018 is still very much on the agenda. Thanks for joining me, it’s been a hoot, as always. See you next time. Mile Jedinak scored Australia’s goal as they drew 1-1 with Japan in Melbourne.

The Norwegian foreign ministry has denied local press reports that it rejected a British request to set up a formal joint taskforce aimed at preparing a post-Brexit free trade deal between the two countries. Ministers have repeatedly given more public money to London’s planned garden bridge, despite official advice against doing so, and risk losing more than £20m if the controversial project is cancelled, according to a report from the National Audit Office (NAO). The pound has continued to fall in the light of concerns about Brexit. But at one point the FTSE 100 hit a record high. Steven Woolfe is seen within Ukip as having destroyed his chances of becoming the party’s next leader in the wake his much-publicised scuffle and a flirtation with the Conservatives, according to senior Ukip figures. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.20pm EDT 12:20 Boris Johnson's speech on Syria - Summary and analysis This was Boris Johnson’s first speech in a debate in the Commons in his role as foreign secretary, and also an opportunity to get some flavour of what the May government’s (non-Brexit) foreign policy is going to be like. Johnson famously wrote a biography of Winston Churchill and at one point this afternoon the the ultra-hawkish Labour MP John Woodock urged Johnson to adopt a Churchillian approach to Russian aggression in Syria. (See 2.56pm.) As mayor of London and a Telegraph columnist Johnson generally tended to be on the more interventionist end of the scale, and so perhaps MPs were expecting him to adopt a rather more muscular approach to Syria policy than was adopted by his predecessor, Philip Hammond. If so, they will have been disappointed. Johnson’s language was probably a bit more condemnatory than Hammond’s would have been in a debate like this. But if you listened carefully to what he said, he was actually adopting a rather cautious, dovish stance. This may be more a reflection of May’s views than Johnson’s. (Nick Timothy, her co-chief of staff and philosophical alter ego, is on record as saying foreign policy should “value stability, “respect sovereignty” and avoid ideological crusades.) But it meant that if any MPs were hoping for Churchill, what they got instead was more Stanley Baldwin. Here are the key points from his speech. Johnson tentatively backed the call for Syria and Russia to be investigated for war crimes by the international criminal court. But he played down prospects of anything happening quickly, saying some ICC prosecutions only take place decades after the offences are committed. He told MPs that the targeting of hospitals in Aleppo amounted to a war crime. Every hospital in eastern Aleppo is believed to have been bombed, some of them more than once, and several have been put out of action. Hospitals have been targeted with such frequency and precision that it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this must be deliberate policy. The House will know that intentionally attacking a hospital amounts to a war crime. It is time, I think, for all these incidents to be fully and properly investigated with a view to assembling the necessary evidence to ensure that justice is done. And yes, to answer the question that has been raised by several honourable and right honourable members, we do think there could be advantages in the [international criminal court] procedures. And I would remind this House that in recent history war criminals have been successfully prosecuted decades after their offences. He also expressed some support for the French bid to get the ICC to launch an investigation into Syria and Russia, saying he was “personally very attracted to the idea of holding these people to account before the international criminal court”. But later, at the Number 10 lobby briefing, Downing Street sounded a bit less keen. Paul Waugh (@paulwaugh) Boris 'personally attracted' to pursuing Syria war crimes through ICC. No,10 asked if that's Govt policy, unaware of details of Boris words October 11, 2016 He played down the prospect of backing no-fly zones over Syria. Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary who called the debate, demanded the creation of no-fly zones and other MPs backed the idea too. Johnson said he had “every sympathy” for what they were proposing and that he would consult allies on the idea. But he also signalled strongly that he would eventually say no. Pointing out that the Commons was opposed to sending troops to Syria, he added: But we cannot commit to a no-fly zone unless we are prepared to ... shoot down planes or helicopters that violate that zone. We need to think very carefully about the consequences. The Labour MP John Woodcock read his comments as a move towards no-fly zones. John Woodcock (@JWoodcockMP) Foreign sec says all options being considered in Syria bar UK boots on ground - including no-fly zone or no bombing zone. *some* progress October 11, 2016 But the Independent’s John Rentoul probably has a more realistic interpretation of Johnson’s words. John Rentoul (@JohnRentoul) Boris Johnson didn't use these precise words, but his message on Syria was: I am not going to start WW3 by shooting down Russian planes. October 11, 2016 Johnson said he would like to see people protest about Syria outside the Russian embassy. The Labour MP Ann Clywd proposed this earlier (see 2.27pm) and Johnson said he agreed with her. I agree with [Ann Clywd]. I would certainly like to see demonstrations outside the Russian embassy. Where is the Stop the War Coalition at the moment? Where are they? He said he was worried that “the wells of outrage [about events in Syria] are growing exhausted”. He said Russia was in danger of becoming an “international pariah” because of what was happening in Syria. If Russia continues in it current path, then I believe that great county is in danger of becoming a pariah nation. If President Putin’s strategy is to restore the greatness and the glory of Russia, then I believe he risks seeing his ambition turn to ashes in the face of international contempt for what is happening in Syria. But he said the “best hope” was to persuade Russia to “do the right thing”. Johnson said the UK had urged the EU to adopt a tough line on sanctions against Russia, but he pointedly refused to commit the UK to pushing for tougher sanctions. He also declined to back a call from Labour’s Toby Perkins for the international community to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia because of what is happening in Syria. Summing up his position Johnson said: In the long term the only realistic solution is to persuade both sides to have a ceasefire and then to work through to a political solution ... Our best hope is to persuade the Russians that it is profoundly in the interests of Russia to take the initiative, to win the acclaim of the international community, do the right thing in Syria, call off their puppets in the Assad regime, stop the bombing and bring peace to Aleppo and have a genuine ceasefire. That is the way. He said the Aleppo siege was the worst in the civil war. At this moment the 275,000 inhabitants of eastern Aleppo are under siege. They are isolated from the outside world, subjected to constant bombardment and prevented from receiving humanitarian aid. Their power and water supplies have been cut off in what has become a signature tactic of the Assad killing machine, to besiege civilian populations. And what we are now seeing in eastern Aleppo is the biggest and potentially the deadliest siege since the outbreak of Syria’s civil war over five years ago. Boris Johnson in the Commons.

(See 3.05pm.) He will urge Theresa May to set up a Brexit committee of the nations and regions to ensure Brexit policy is not just decided by London. He will say: Theresa May has got the Brexit negotiations off on entirely the wrong foot and needs to change direction. She is working on the assumption that the country voted for a hard, confrontational Brexit when there is no evidence to support this. In fact, it would seem that the opposite is true – a majority of people were against a hard Brexit. There is a big risk that her handling of these crucial talks could widen the divides in our country, not heal them. We need to open our eyes to these risks and ensure that all voices and perspectives are fully involved in shaping the Brexit negotiations. Devolution in England was never conceived as part of the answer to Brexit but now it must be fully embraced as such. Brexit will have a differential impact on different parts of the country and a hard Brexit would hit the poorest areas hardest of all. Great effort will be expended to protect the financial sector and the City of London, which, while understandable, could lead to trade-offs that will damage other sectors. These issues need to be openly debated and that is why I am asking the prime minister to establish a Brexit committee of the nations and regions, with places for the devolved governments and the elected mayoralties. The aim of that committee should be to seek a fair Brexit that balances the needs of all parts of the country. It is essential that Greater Manchester has a place at this table. Andy Burnham.

At the post-lunch session, Miliband, who’s been energised by the battle to secure a parliamentary vote on article 50, told the audience the left should seize the opportunity of Brexit, which he said was a vote for radical change, and warned against focusing only on the detail of the deal with the rest of the EU. If Brexit just becomes about the negotiations, we’re going to be stuffed, because all of the weight of the mandate will be borne by the rules on free movement and so on. We have got to have a bigger vision for where the country’s going. Of course, Theresa May’s already fleshed out what kind of mandate she thinks the Brexit vote gives her, including legitimising a much tougher immigration regime - and Cable was much blunter. He said: The electorate has moved to the right, which was reflected in a rather brutal way in the referendum. He said voters he spoke to during the last general election combined fear of a left-wing government, with identity politics - patriotism/nationalism. “We have to try and find a way of breaking through the tribal divisions on the centre left,” he said, adding that many of the 48% of voters who rejected Brexit feel “horribly dispossessed”. Miliband tellingly said the left must find a way to “surmount” identity politics; Cable said Harold Wilson and Tony Blair managed to articulate a left-of-centre version of patriotism.

Rachel Graf Oct 10, 2016 2:20 PM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Alphabet  (GOOGL) were gaining in mid-afternoon trading on Monday after Axiom increased its price target to $1,000 from $990 and reiterated a "buy" rating on the stock.  The Google parent company will likely exceed consensus estimates when it reports 2016 third quarter earnings on October 27, the firm wrote in a note cited by Barron's.  The fourth quarter should beat expectations as well, and 2017 should be strong due to search innovations and continued growth at its YouTube unit, Axiom noted. YouTube's strength should help offset a tough Google Websites comp from a year ago, when Google launched a third search link on mobile, the the firm stated.  Additionally, Wells Fargo believes that Google will continue to take share from "non-TV media," and could see an uptick in revenue from "non-advertising marketing services," TheFly reports. The firm reiterated an "outperform" rating on the stock. Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates the stock as a "buy" with a ratings score of A.

These alternatives will do the job Eli Blumenthal facebook SHARE twitter TWEET email google-plus linkedin reddit More At this point, one thing about the Galaxy Note 7 is very clear: Samsung's latest smartphone is unsafe. After a weekend filled with constant reports of replacement Note 7 phones continuing to explode from battery issues, the company has seen a wave of backlash. AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon have all stopped offering the replacement devices while Samsung has changed its production schedule on new units.

All the major carriers, including Sprint, are allowing customers to return Note 7s and exchange them for another phone of their choosing. T-Mobile is even throwing in a $25 bill credit to anyone who returns the phone. It remains to be seen if the Consumer Product Safety Commission will issue a new recall for the phones, but if you do have one you should stop and return them as soon as possible. All the major carriers, including Sprint, are allowing customers to return Note 7s and exchange them for another phone of their choosing.  Photo: Getty Images But what should you get instead? Here are a few replacements worth considering. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge If you really love your Note 7's water resistance, great camera, wireless charging and crisp display, you should strongly consider the Galaxy S7 Edge. Samsung's top Galaxy S7 phone has a slightly smaller screen and lacks some of the Note 7's bells and whistles, namely the USB-C port, iris scanner and stylus support, but is as close as you'll find to the Note 7. Advertisement It's an excellent phone, and unlike the Note 7, there have been hardly any reports of exploding battery issues. It is also cheaper than the Note 7, so you should get some money back from your carrier, too. Apple iPhone 7 Plus If you're done with Samsung and want to switch, the iPhone 7 Plus is an enticing option. It has a large 5.5-inch display, improved camera and finally offers water resistance. You should back up and return your Note 7 as soon as you can. Photo: reddit: Crushader It's not the perfect Note 7 replacement -- the battery does not last as long, the display is not as sharp and the water resistance on the Note is better than the iPhone. Oh, and there's no headphone jack. But it is the best iPhone on the market and a compelling alternative. Apple also has a free Android to iPhone app in the Google Play store called "Move to iOS" to help make the switching process easier. the iPhone 7 Plus is a good alternative to the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Photo: Bloomberg Google Pixel XL If you have another phone you can use for a little bit, the Google Pixel XL may be the phone for you. Google's first smartphone will be out October 20, and like the other phones on this list, it has a 5.5-inch display, fast charging battery that promises nearly 7 hours of charge in 15 minutes, and unlimited storage for photos and videos on Google Photos. It runs the latest version of Android, version 7.1 Nougat, and even supports Google's new Daydream virtual reality platform, giving you a replacement for Samsung's Gear VR. Unlike the Galaxy S7 or iPhone 7 Plus, the Pixel XL will be exclusive to Verizon. An unlocked option will be available from Google that works on the other major carriers, but according to Google's site, it is either out of stock or on a 5-6 week backorder. LG V20 For those looking for an Android phone not made by Samsung, and can't wait for the Pixel, the LG V20 is a strong contender. It's 5.7-inch high resolution display matches the Note 7 and also features a speedy processor and dual cameras for improved pictures. It's not water resistant like the Note 7, but it does feature a replaceable battery, a rarity amongst high-end phones that still is appreciated. As with the Pixel, you're going to need to use a different phone for the time being. The LG V20 hits T-Mobile and Sprint on October 28 and will come to AT&T and Verizon, though a release date has yet to be announced. These are just a few of the many great phones available, including strong contenders from HTC, OnePlus and Huawei. Regardless of what phone you get, you should back up and return your Note 7 as soon as you can. USA Today Advertisement Advertisement HuffPost Australia How To Make The Best Cafe-Style Granola ...
