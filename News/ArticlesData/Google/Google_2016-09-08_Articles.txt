Just Ask Hiroshima. Julie Makinen | Los Angeles Times “Before the war, the savory crepes—whose lineage can be traced to Chinese pancakes known as jianbing—were sold as kids’ snacks throughout Hiroshima. Then, after 1945, war widows anxious to make ends meet started opening okonomiyaki stalls and some converted rooms in their homes into small restaurants. They threw in whatever ingredients they could get their hands on, such as oysters and squid and soba noodles cooked by their fellow stall owners, along with ration ingredients provided by the U.S. occupiers. The elaboration was all well and good, because okonomiyaki literally means “whatever you like—grilled,” and in the lean years after the war, cheap one-dish meals were all many Hiroshimans could afford.” * * * Google’s Clever Plan to Stop Aspiring ISIS Recruits Andy Greenberg | WIRED “Jigsaw, the Google-owned tech incubator and think tank—until recently known as Google Ideas—has been working over the past year to develop a new program it hopes can use a combination of Google’s search advertising algorithms and YouTube’s video platform to target aspiring ISIS recruits and ultimately dissuade them from joining the group’s cult of apocalyptic violence. The program, which Jigsaw calls the Redirect Method and plans to launch in a new phase this month, places advertising alongside results for any keywords and phrases that Jigsaw has determined people attracted to ISIS commonly search for. Those ads link to Arabic- and English-language YouTube channels that pull together preexisting videos Jigsaw believes can effectively undo ISIS’s brainwashing—clips like testimonials from former extremists, imams denouncing ISIS’s corruption of Islam, and surreptitiously filmed clips inside the group’s dysfunctional caliphate in Northern Syria and Iraq.” * * * Reforming Ukraine After the Revolutions Joshua Yaffa | The New Yorker “Wen Sergii Leshchenko was at university, in Ukraine, he dreamed of working in television news. He is the son of two Soviet-trained engineers, and grew up in Kiev, where he studied journalism. He aspired to become an on-air correspondent, but his speech was mumbly and imprecise. After an unsuccessful summer internship at a local news channel, in 2000, he heard that a new online publication, Ukrayinska Pravda, was desperately looking for reporters; in recent weeks, nearly all the staff had quit, fed up with low pay and worn down by pressure from authorities. His interview took place in a cramped and sparsely furnished three-room apartment, where he was met by the site’s founder and editor-in-chief, Georgiy Gongadze, a thirty-one-year-old reporter. Gongadze regularly received threats from Ukrainian officials because of his muckraking investigations. The power was out in the apartment, so Leshchenko and Gongadze sat in darkness. After a few minutes, Gongadze told him that he could start right away.” * * * Human Rights in Colombia’s City of Women Kary Stewart | Pacific Standard “At that time the Colombian government had no strategy in place to deal with this influx of emigrant women. They were left to live in slums, building shelters from scraps they found and doing whatever work they could to feed their children. There was no water, sanitation, or any other basic facilities. ‘We lived in subhuman conditions,’ Mejía recalls. ‘Our homes were built on dirt and our children walked about barefoot. All we could do was cling to the hope that we had arrived with.’” * * * Trapped in Homs, Architect Imagines a New Future for Syrian Cities Stephen Heyman | The New York Times “Did Syria’s urban architecture help fuel the civil war that has shattered the country and claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people? This is the provocative theory proposed by Marwa al-Sabouni, a young architect from Homs who spent two years confined to her apartment with her husband and two children as the city’s historic heart was reduced to rubble. In a Ted talk (now viewed over 500,000 times) and a recent book, “The Battle for Home,” Ms. Sabouni, 34, performs a kind of architectural autopsy on her native city, cataloging failings of design and infrastructure that she said paved the way for its eventual destruction.” * * * The Shipping Noose Joshua Keating | Slate “You probably didn’t notice it while running errands last weekend, but the vast global network that moves foreign-made boxer shorts and Bluetooth headsets to your neighborhood store is experiencing a major malfunction. Last week, South Korean shipping company Hanjin, the world’s seventh-largest container line, filed for bankruptcy after failing to reach an agreement with its creditors to alleviate its $5.37 billion in debt. This has left 85 of the 97 container ships the company operates literally stranded at sea, as ports refused to admit them for fear that stevedores and tugboat crews won’t be paid. Even if the situation is resolved soon, the unprecedented mess is an ominous indicator about the state of global trade.” Share Tweet Comments Latest Video A Portrait of the Tensions in Coal Country The documentary Blood on the Mountain explores the war over West Virginia's past and future.

Why did Hillary Clinton lose last week’s presidential election? The candidate herself believes James Comey, the FBI director who notified Congress in an October 28 letter that he was reopening the inquiry into her private emails, was to blame. Her campaign, meanwhile, has cited “a host of uncontrollable headwinds,” asserting that her team did all they could in an unforeseeably difficult environment. Many Democrats, however, are less forgiving of the campaign and its strategy. It may be true that the Comey letter shaved a crucial few points off Clinton’s vote in the home stretch. But critics believe a better campaign would have left her less exposed to a last-minute surprise. If not for a series of miscalculations, these critics contend, the Comey letter wouldn’t have had the impact it did—and she might be president-elect today. Continue Reading The Voorhes How Casinos Enable Gambling Addicts John Rosengren Modern slot machines develop an unbreakable hold on many players—some of whom wind up losing their jobs, their families, and even, as in the case of Scott Stevens, their lives. On the morning of Monday, August 13, 2012, Scott Stevens loaded a brown hunting bag into his Jeep Grand Cherokee, then went to the master bedroom, where he hugged Stacy, his wife of 23 years. “I love you,” he told her. Stacy thought that her husband was off to a job interview followed by an appointment with his therapist. Instead, he drove the 22 miles from their home in Steubenville, Ohio, to the Mountaineer Casino, just outside New Cumberland, West Virginia. He used the casino ATM to check his bank-account balance: $13,400. He walked across the casino floor to his favorite slot machine in the high-limit area: Triple Stars, a three-reel game that cost $10 a spin. Maybe this time it would pay out enough to save him. Continue Reading Eric Thayer / Reuters An Unpredictable Upcoming Matchup: Donald Trump vs. Big Business Kevin Carty The president-elect may seem an unlikely trust-buster, but he’s indicated an openness to reviving America’s once-robust anti-monopoly apparatus. The election of Donald Trump has prompted many stories about how, or whether, he will roll back the policies that make up President Obama’s economic legacy, including the Affordable Care Act and 2010’s Dodd-Frank banking regulations. But one of the most important, if underappreciated, stories of the coming administration will be Trump’s approach toward big business and the system that regulates it: anti-monopoly policy. In the past year, via an executive order and several papers from the White House’s top economists, President Obama and his team began paving the way for tougher competition policy. His administration has blocked more mergers than administrations in the recent past, including successful challenges to such mammoth deals as GE and Electrolux, Comcast and Time Warner, and Halliburton and Baker Hughes. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren and even Hillary Clinton (far from anyone’s idea of a trust-buster) came out in favor of more aggressive anti-monopoly policy, and the Democrats added an antitrust pledge to their party platform—a plank that had been absent since 1988. Continue Reading Oliver Munday China’s Great Leap Backward James Fallows The country has become repressive in a way that it has not been since the Cultural Revolution. What does its darkening political climate—and growing belligerence—mean for the United States? What if China is going bad? Since early last year I have been asking people inside and outside China versions of this question. By “bad” I don’t mean morally. Moral and ethical factors obviously matter in foreign policy, but I’m talking about something different. Nor is the question mainly about economics, although for China the short-term stability and long-term improvement of jobs, wages, and living standards are fundamental to the government’s survival. Under China’s single-party Communist arrangement, sustained economic failure would naturally raise questions about the system as a whole, as it did in the Soviet Union. True, modern China’s economic performance even during its slowdowns is like the Soviet Union’s during its booms. But the absence of a political outlet for dissatisfaction is similar. Continue Reading Edmon de Haro What Obama Got Right Jonathan Rauch The outgoing president has resolved old problems and avoided new ones. In one respect, presidents are like kindergartners. Well, sometimes in more than one respect, depending on the president. That aside, presidents and kindergartners have in common that one of the simplest ways to evaluate them is also one of the best: Do they clean up when they’re finished? People who talk about presidential legacies typically have grandeur in mind. Did a president enact large new programs? Win a war? Forge a political realignment? Pass the torch to a new generation? End tyranny in the world? But the romantic ideal of the overachieving chief executive ignores the fact that presidents can much more easily do harm than good (another respect in which they resemble kindergartners). The world is full of traps and snares, and the presidency is surrounded by what the historian Gil Troy has called invisible trip wires, which are liable to snag presidents who overstep. Continue Reading Regis Duvignau / Reuters Twitter's Misbegotten Censorship David Frum The right way to deal with social media’s neo-Nazis is not by taking away their platforms, but by taking away their audiences. The very last tweet from the now-suspended Twitter account of the alt-right leader Richard B. Spencer was directed at me. On Tuesday afternoon, I tweeted a link to a BuzzFeed report that Russia’s English-language channel, RT, was testing a new program featuring Katie Hopkins. (Hopkins, for those unfamiliar, is a provocative British media personality, perhaps best known for a TV interview in which she described judging her children’s playmates by whether their given names were posh enough.) Spencer retorted to my Hopkins tweet: “We’re winning. You’re losing.” My answer remains on my Twitter timeline as a punchline without a setup: “You’d have said that on the afternoon of the Guernica bombing too. Wasn’t true then; isn’t true now.” Minutes after that exchange, Spencer’s account vanished, as did that of his website, as well as nearly a dozen other people associated with Spencer's brand of racialist politics. All this on a day when Spencer had appeared on NPR and the Daily Show. Continue Reading Nathan Chute / Reuters Better Off Before Obamacare? Olga Khazan Before the law, which Trump has said he would repeal, health insurance was cheaper for a few, but outright unattainable for many. Throughout his campaign, President-Elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, which he called “a disaster.” That was music to his supporters’ ears. Repealing Obamacare is Republican voters’ biggest priority for the Trump administration, according to a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll. People who are unhappy with the Affordable Care Act overwhelmingly voted for Trump, and now 74 percent of Republicans want it gone. The frustration with the health law is understandable; many people are struggling to afford medical care even if they have insurance. The problem is, it’s not clear Americans would have been better off had Obamacare never been passed. First, some people might be confused about what, exactly, they’re angry at. When we talk about “Obamacare,” we’re talking primarily about the 12.7 million people who are buying individual insurance coverage through state marketplaces or Healthcare.gov. Roughly 60 million people voted for Trump last week, so they can’t all be on Obamacare exchange plans. More than half of all non-elderly Americans still get insurance through work, and premiums on employer-based plans are actually growing more slowly than average. (About a third of Americans are either on Medicare or Medicaid, and the rest are uninsured. Only about 4 percent are on the exchanges.) Continue Reading Neil Hall / Reuters A Post-Brexit Roadmap for Disaffected Clinton Voters Linda Kinstler Much of your country appears to reject your values. What do you do now? The morning after Britain voted to leave the European Union, the Remain campaign and the overwhelmingly young, urban liberals who championed its cause, awoke to the reality of bitter, unexpected defeat. Tammy Palmer, an activist who campaigned against Brexit, cried all the way to work. “By the time I got off the tube, I was like, right, screw it, I’m going to find an army, and I’m going to lead that army, and [Brexit] is not going to happen,” she said. People poured out onto the streets to protest the outcome, to march for Europe. Then, they started organizing. Emails with subject lines like “#GenerationFucked #SaveLondon #SaveBritain” circulated among young activists and writers, sketching out possible plans for action. Continue Reading Pascal Pochard-Casabianca / AFP / Getty Playing the Workaholic on Social Media Laur M. Jackson "Public displays of working" are part humblebrag, part cry for help. Though the sentiment “fuck my life,” expressed in some form or another, has existed as long as life has been terrible, the abbreviation “FML” is entirely an invention of the internet’s social age. While it’s hard to know from where it originally sprung, it was popularized via the website-or-blog-or-bulletin Fmylife.com. Fmylife.com was created in 2008 by Maxime Valette, Guillaume Passaglia, and Didier Guedjas as an English adaptation of their French Viedemerde.fr. Though the site began just as a work in translation, it quickly gained its own rightful traction and tons of submissions in English. It also set the grammatical terms of use for “FML” more generally. Fmylife.com depended on sharing and thrived on an economy of bad feelings: Users submitted their best (worst) tales of woe—always beginning with “Today,” always ending on “FML.” Other users then evaluated the stories by clicking either “I agree, your life sucks” or “You totally deserve it.” Continue Reading We're Probably Imagining Aliens Wrong Nadine Ajaka Why haven’t we found extraterrestrial life?

 Wherever you go online, someone is trying to personalize your web experience and that could be changing your identity Tanya Kant, The Conversation UK Sep. 9, 2016, 7:45 PM 1,686 facebook linkedin twitter email print Wherever you go online, someone is trying to personalise your web experience. Your preferences are pre-empted, your intentions and motivations predicted. That toaster you briefly glanced at three months ago keeps returning to haunt your browsing in tailored advertising sidebars. And it’s not a one-way street. In fact, the quite impersonal mechanics of some personalisation systems may not only influence how we see the world, but how we see ourselves. It happens every day, to all of us while we’re online. Facebook’s News Feed attempts to deliver tailored content that “most interests” individual users. Amazon’s recommendation engine uses personal data tracking combined with other users’ browsing habits to suggest relevant products. Google customises search results, and much more: for example, personalisation app Google Now seeks to “give you the information you need throughout your day, before you even ask”. Such personalisation systems don’t just aim to provide relevance to users; through targeted marketing strategies, they also generate profit for many free-to-use web services. Perhaps the best-known critique of this process is the “filter bubble” theory. Proposed by internet activist Eli Pariser, this theory suggests that personalisation can detrimentally affect web users’ experiences. Instead of being exposed to universal, diverse content, users are algorithmically delivered material that matches their pre-existing, self-affirming viewpoints. The filter bubble therefore poses a problem for democratic engagement: by restricting access to challenging and diverse points of view, users are unable to participate in collective and informed debate. Attempts to find evidence of the filter bubble have produced mixed results. Some studies have shown that personalisation can indeed lead to a “myopic” view of a topic; other studies have found that in different contexts, personalisation can actually help users discover common and diverse content. My research suggests that personalisation does not just affect how we see the world, but how we view ourselves. What’s more, the influence of personalisation on our identities may not be due to filter bubbles of consumption, but because in some instances online personalisation is not very “personal” at all. Data tracking and user pre-emption To understand this, it is useful to consider how online personalisation is achieved. Although personalisation systems track our individual web movements, they are not designed to “know” or identify us as individuals. Instead, these systems collate users’ real-time movements and habits into mass data sets, and look for patterns and correlations between users’ movements. The found patterns and correlations are then translated back into identity categories that we might recognise (such as age, gender, language and interests) and that we might fit into. By looking for mass patterns in order to deliver personally relevant content, personalisation is in fact based on a rather impersonal process. Reidar Hahn/Fermilab When the filter bubble theory first emerged in 2011, Pariser argued that one of the biggest problems with personalisation was that users did not know it was happening. Nowadays, despite objections to data tracking, many users are aware that they are being tracked in exchange for use of free services, and that this tracking is used for forms of personalisation. Far less clear, however, are the specifics of what is being personalised for us, how and when. Finding the ‘personal’ My research suggests that some users assume their experiences are being personalised to complex degrees. In an in-depth qualitative study of 36 web users, upon seeing advertising for weight loss products on Facebook some female users reported that they assumed that Facebook had profiled them as overweight or fitness-oriented. In fact, these weight loss ads were delivered generically to women aged 24-30. However, because users can be unaware of the impersonal nature of some personalisation systems, such targeted ads can have a detrimental impact on how these users view themselves: to put it crudely, they must be overweight, because Facebook tells them they are. It’s not just targeted advertising that can have this impact: in an ethnographic and longitudinal study conducted of a handful of 18 and 19-year-old Google Now users, I found that some participants assumed the app was capable of personalisation to an extraordinarily complex extent. Users reported that they believed Google Now showed them stocks information because Google knew their parents were stockholders, or that Google (wrongly) pre-empted a “commute” to “work” because participants had once lied about being over school age on their YouTube accounts. It goes without saying that this small-scale study does not represent the engagements of all Google Now users: but it does suggest that for these individuals, the predictive promises of Google Now were almost infallible. Screenshot In fact, critiques of user-centred design suggest that the reality of Google’s inferences is much more impersonal: Google Now assumes that its “ideal user” does – or at least should – have an interest in stocks, and that all users are workers who commute. Such critiques highlight that it is these assumptions which largely structure Google’s personalisation framework (for example through the app’s adherence to predefined “card” categories such as “Sports”, which during my study only allowed users to ‘follow’ men’s rather than women’s UK football clubs). However, rather than questioning the app’s assumptions, my study suggests that participants placed themselves outside the expected norm: they trusted Google to tell them what their personal experiences should look like. Though these might seem like extreme examples of impersonal algorithmic inference and user assumption, the fact that we cannot be sure what is being personalised, when or how are more common problems. To me, these user testimonies highlight that the tailoring of online content has implications beyond the fact that it might be detrimental for democracy. They suggest that unless we begin to understand that personalisation can at times operate via highly impersonal frameworks, we may be putting too much faith in personalisation to tell us how we should behave, and who we should be, rather than vice versa.

Stacy thought that her husband was off to a job interview followed by an appointment with his therapist. Instead, he drove the 22 miles from their home in Steubenville, Ohio, to the Mountaineer Casino, just outside New Cumberland, West Virginia. He used the casino ATM to check his bank-account balance: $13,400. He walked across the casino floor to his favorite slot machine in the high-limit area: Triple Stars, a three-reel game that cost $10 a spin. Maybe this time it would pay out enough to save him. Continue Reading Eric Thayer / Reuters An Unpredictable Upcoming Matchup: Donald Trump vs. Big Business Kevin Carty The president-elect may seem an unlikely trust-buster, but he’s indicated an openness to reviving America’s once-robust anti-monopoly apparatus. The election of Donald Trump has prompted many stories about how, or whether, he will roll back the policies that make up President Obama’s economic legacy, including the Affordable Care Act and 2010’s Dodd-Frank banking regulations. But one of the most important, if underappreciated, stories of the coming administration will be Trump’s approach toward big business and the system that regulates it: anti-monopoly policy. In the past year, via an executive order and several papers from the White House’s top economists, President Obama and his team began paving the way for tougher competition policy. His administration has blocked more mergers than administrations in the recent past, including successful challenges to such mammoth deals as GE and Electrolux, Comcast and Time Warner, and Halliburton and Baker Hughes. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren and even Hillary Clinton (far from anyone’s idea of a trust-buster) came out in favor of more aggressive anti-monopoly policy, and the Democrats added an antitrust pledge to their party platform—a plank that had been absent since 1988. Continue Reading Oliver Munday China’s Great Leap Backward James Fallows The country has become repressive in a way that it has not been since the Cultural Revolution. What does its darkening political climate—and growing belligerence—mean for the United States? What if China is going bad? Since early last year I have been asking people inside and outside China versions of this question. By “bad” I don’t mean morally. Moral and ethical factors obviously matter in foreign policy, but I’m talking about something different. Nor is the question mainly about economics, although for China the short-term stability and long-term improvement of jobs, wages, and living standards are fundamental to the government’s survival. Under China’s single-party Communist arrangement, sustained economic failure would naturally raise questions about the system as a whole, as it did in the Soviet Union. True, modern China’s economic performance even during its slowdowns is like the Soviet Union’s during its booms. But the absence of a political outlet for dissatisfaction is similar. Continue Reading Edmon de Haro What Obama Got Right Jonathan Rauch The outgoing president has resolved old problems and avoided new ones. In one respect, presidents are like kindergartners. Well, sometimes in more than one respect, depending on the president. That aside, presidents and kindergartners have in common that one of the simplest ways to evaluate them is also one of the best: Do they clean up when they’re finished? People who talk about presidential legacies typically have grandeur in mind. Did a president enact large new programs? Win a war? Forge a political realignment? Pass the torch to a new generation? End tyranny in the world? But the romantic ideal of the overachieving chief executive ignores the fact that presidents can much more easily do harm than good (another respect in which they resemble kindergartners). The world is full of traps and snares, and the presidency is surrounded by what the historian Gil Troy has called invisible trip wires, which are liable to snag presidents who overstep. Continue Reading Regis Duvignau / Reuters Twitter's Misbegotten Censorship David Frum The right way to deal with social media’s neo-Nazis is not by taking away their platforms, but by taking away their audiences. The very last tweet from the now-suspended Twitter account of the alt-right leader Richard B. Spencer was directed at me. On Tuesday afternoon, I tweeted a link to a BuzzFeed report that Russia’s English-language channel, RT, was testing a new program featuring Katie Hopkins. (Hopkins, for those unfamiliar, is a provocative British media personality, perhaps best known for a TV interview in which she described judging her children’s playmates by whether their given names were posh enough.) Spencer retorted to my Hopkins tweet: “We’re winning. You’re losing.” My answer remains on my Twitter timeline as a punchline without a setup: “You’d have said that on the afternoon of the Guernica bombing too. Wasn’t true then; isn’t true now.” Minutes after that exchange, Spencer’s account vanished, as did that of his website, as well as nearly a dozen other people associated with Spencer's brand of racialist politics. All this on a day when Spencer had appeared on NPR and the Daily Show. Continue Reading Nathan Chute / Reuters Better Off Before Obamacare? Olga Khazan Before the law, which Trump has said he would repeal, health insurance was cheaper for a few, but outright unattainable for many. Throughout his campaign, President-Elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare, which he called “a disaster.” That was music to his supporters’ ears. Repealing Obamacare is Republican voters’ biggest priority for the Trump administration, according to a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll. People who are unhappy with the Affordable Care Act overwhelmingly voted for Trump, and now 74 percent of Republicans want it gone. The frustration with the health law is understandable; many people are struggling to afford medical care even if they have insurance. The problem is, it’s not clear Americans would have been better off had Obamacare never been passed. First, some people might be confused about what, exactly, they’re angry at. When we talk about “Obamacare,” we’re talking primarily about the 12.7 million people who are buying individual insurance coverage through state marketplaces or Healthcare.gov. Roughly 60 million people voted for Trump last week, so they can’t all be on Obamacare exchange plans. More than half of all non-elderly Americans still get insurance through work, and premiums on employer-based plans are actually growing more slowly than average. (About a third of Americans are either on Medicare or Medicaid, and the rest are uninsured. Only about 4 percent are on the exchanges.) Continue Reading Neil Hall / Reuters A Post-Brexit Roadmap for Disaffected Clinton Voters Linda Kinstler Much of your country appears to reject your values. What do you do now? The morning after Britain voted to leave the European Union, the Remain campaign and the overwhelmingly young, urban liberals who championed its cause, awoke to the reality of bitter, unexpected defeat. Tammy Palmer, an activist who campaigned against Brexit, cried all the way to work. “By the time I got off the tube, I was like, right, screw it, I’m going to find an army, and I’m going to lead that army, and [Brexit] is not going to happen,” she said. People poured out onto the streets to protest the outcome, to march for Europe. Then, they started organizing. Emails with subject lines like “#GenerationFucked #SaveLondon #SaveBritain” circulated among young activists and writers, sketching out possible plans for action. Continue Reading Pascal Pochard-Casabianca / AFP / Getty Playing the Workaholic on Social Media Laur M. Jackson "Public displays of working" are part humblebrag, part cry for help. Though the sentiment “fuck my life,” expressed in some form or another, has existed as long as life has been terrible, the abbreviation “FML” is entirely an invention of the internet’s social age. While it’s hard to know from where it originally sprung, it was popularized via the website-or-blog-or-bulletin Fmylife.com. Fmylife.com was created in 2008 by Maxime Valette, Guillaume Passaglia, and Didier Guedjas as an English adaptation of their French Viedemerde.fr. Though the site began just as a work in translation, it quickly gained its own rightful traction and tons of submissions in English. It also set the grammatical terms of use for “FML” more generally. Fmylife.com depended on sharing and thrived on an economy of bad feelings: Users submitted their best (worst) tales of woe—always beginning with “Today,” always ending on “FML.” Other users then evaluated the stories by clicking either “I agree, your life sucks” or “You totally deserve it.” Continue Reading We're Probably Imagining Aliens Wrong Nadine Ajaka Why haven’t we found extraterrestrial life?

These photos were on the Camera Roll. How do we upload the ones that are just in Photos? — Susan McDonald Google Photos app settings on an iPhone 6. If you want your phone’s photos backed up to the cloud, make sure the “Back up & sync” feature is turned on. Tech+ If you’re ever wondering why an app doesn’t work, head to the settings. And for smartphones, there are two places to find an app’s settings. Start with the phone’s own settings. This area usually gives an app its permissions — let it track your location, access all your files or use cell data for uploads? In the iPhone’s case with the Google Photos app, here’s how to get there: Settings >> Google Photos. You’ll see three things Google Photos is asking for access to, including your phone’s “Photos.” Now go to the Google Photos app. Find the three horizontal lines at the top left and you’ll see “Settings.” In this case, you’ll want to make sure your “Back up & sync” settings are turned on. Feel free to explore the rest of the options to see if anything else is blocking Google Photos from accessing your iPhone’s “Photos.” If the process is unsatisfactory, your photos may not actually be on your phone. Apple iPhones store photos two ways — in Camera Roll and in My Photo Stream. Camera Roll refers to photos stored on the device. My Photo Stream are photos stored in the cloud and may actually be stored on other devices. If photos are in My Photo Stream, then they’re already backed up in a second location. Now, if you’re talking about older photos that are not on your phone but were backed up to a PC via iTunes, Google has a way to quickly copy those older photos to the cloud too. Download the Google Photos desktop uploader from photos.google.com/apps and it will lead you through the process of linking folders filled with old photos on your PC to the cloud. For readers who decide to stick with Apple’s own back-up service in its iCloud, you can make sure all old and new photos on the phone are getting backed up online. Just follow these steps: Settings >>Photos & Camera >>iCloud Photo library (the description says it all: “Automatically upload and store your entire library in iCloud to access photos and videos from all your devices.”) Keep in mind that auto backup means you may run out of the free 5 GBs of iCloud storage or the free 15 GBs on Google Drive. It’s easy to add more gigabytes but it’ll cost you — starting at 99 cents a month for 50 GB at Apple’s iCloud and $1.99 per month for 100 GBs at Google.

Relative to the root of mozilla-central, the sandbox exists at: security/sandbox The chromium sandbox is based on the chromium base libraries (Google's code) which are located at: security/sandbox/chromium/base There is also partial/shim code to get the base code compiling with our SDK build settings or to limit the base code by reducing dependencies at: security/sandbox/chromium-shim/base The chromium Windows sandbox itself (Google's code) is located at: security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win Processes Overview There are 2 processes when dealing with a sandboxed application: The broker: The parent process that starts sandboxed children The target: The child process that is sandboxed Both processes make use of the chromium sandbox library, but they make use of it indirectly through 2 libraries (Mozilla code). This indirect use of the library is due to header conflicts with the ipc layer where it has a different, much older, non compatible, copy of the chromium base library: For the broker, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker For the target, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxtarget Build settings To disable building the sandbox completely build with this in your mozconfig: ac_add_options --disable-sandbox To disable just the content sandbox parts: ac_add_options --disable-content-sandbox Environment variables Disable content process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX Disable media plugin sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_GMP_SANDBOX Disable NPAPI process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_NPAPI_SANDBOX Allow weaker than default sandbox level MOZ_ALLOW_WEAKER_SANDBOX Enable sandbox logging MOZ_WIN_SANDBOX_LOGGING Key source code locations The sandboxed target process lowers its own privileges after initialization via these calls: Content process GMP process NPAPI process Level descriptions header: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/security_level.h The call that starts the sandboxed process in Firefox is: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/918df3a0bc1c/ipc/glue/GeckoChildProcessHost.cpp#1030 All of the code that sets policies can be found here: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker/sandboxBroker.cpp OSX The OSX sandbox is based on the TrustedBSD MAC Framework. It is undocumented and considered private by Apple. Mozilla OSX Sandbox Ruleset wiki page OSX Sandbox OSX sandbox policy language Linux Seccomp stands for secure computing mode. It's a simple sandboxing tool in the Linux kernel, available since Linux version 2.6.12. When enabling seccomp, the process enters a "secure mode" where a very small number of system calls are available (exit(), read(), write(), sigreturn()). Writing code to work in this environment is difficult; for example, dynamic memory allocation (using brk() or mmap(), either directly or to implement malloc()) is not possible. Seccomp-BPF is a more recent extension to seccomp, which allows filtering system calls with BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. Most of our Linux user base have systems that support seccomp-bpf. These filters can be used to allow or deny an arbitrary set of system calls, as well as filter on system call arguments (numeric values only; pointer arguments can't be dereferenced). Additionally, instead of simply terminating the process, the filter can raise a signal, which allows the signal handler to simulate the effect of a disallowed system call (or simply gather more information on the failure for debugging purposes). Seccomp-bpf is available since Linux version 3.5 and is usable on the ARM architecture since Linux version 3.10. Several backports are available for earlier kernel versions. For limitations that apply to the semantics of system calls (e.g., “can this process access the filesystem”, not “can this process use system call #83”) we require unprivileged user namespaces, which a large majority of desktop users don't support. Specifically: chroot()ing into a deleted directory to revoke FS access, and namespace unsharing for networking, SysV IPC if possible, and process IDs. seccomp-bpf filtering rules for various processes Bug Lists Milestones Windows Content Process sbwc1 Roll out level 1 sandbox policy to release. sbwc2 Roll out level 2 sandbox policy to release.

Because it's fast, cheap and easy How to stay connected while traveling with cheap and easy mobile access Businesses brace for cost-cutting measures as the use of wireless data expands Video Rapid review: Hasselblad True Zoom Moto Mod Project Fi may finally let you bundle multiple friends and family members into one group wireless plan. According to Android Police, which dug into the latest Project Fi app’s APK, there are several references that allude to a forthcoming family plan. There’s no set launch date, but the work is clearly underway since it’s hiding in plain site in the latest version of the Project Fi app. Why this matters: Project Fi is Google’s strange but intriguing take on wireless service. You need a Nexus phone, which is engineered to bounce between Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and open Wi-Fi networks for service. The service is pretty cheap with data costing only $10 per GB, but the lack of any type of group plans and limitation to Nexus phones has made it impractical for most consumers. Finally, group plans are coming  The first piece of evidence is the most obvious: Several pieces of code string refer to a “group plan.” There’s a main account that gets control over data allowances. Since Fi lets you choose a bucket of data each month, presumably you’d be able to parcel out a gigabyte here and there depending on individual needs. Other hints in the code reveal that the usual parental control found with the mainstream carriers, such as usage alerts and the ability to cut the cord on the flow of data, will be present as well. You can even toss someone off your plan and send them on their own. Google has slowly been making moves to make Fi more appealing, as this summer it ramped up international coverage to include LTE and added U.S. Cellular as a domestic carrier partner. I used Project Fi this summer when visiting the Netherlands, U.K., France, and Ireland and found it to be a great experience. Data was fast, with LTE in most locations, and phone calls were surprisingly clear. But the lack of any type of group plan has meant it’s a no-go for me as a regular service, as I’m sure is the case for others. Is Google serious, or just experimenting? Google has never provided any subscriber numbers, so it’s difficult to tell if this is still all some grand experiment designed to nudge the wireless industry into more liberal data usage or to gain insights into how people use their phones. Family plans could convince a few tech-savvy users like me to make the leap, but the other major roadblock is the limitation to Nexus phones. Google would need to partner with other hardware makers to make them Fi-ready. We haven’t heard any buzz about that, and it’s unlikely the company would be eager to invest the resources for what is likely a network with very low usage. But if Google would expand beyond Nexus, it’d certainly be a more viable option. Yet, while Google may be building out Fi’s capabilities now, it wouldn’t be shocking if one day it pulled a Project Ara and shut the whole thing down. One likely place to learn more about Fi’s plans is at Google’s rumored hardware event in October, where we should see new phones, Google Home, and a 4K Chromecast. It’d be an ideal place to proclaim new Fi family plans just in time for those glimmering new phones.

While hard-working people and UK businesses have paid their dues, some of the world’s biggest companies have avoided doing so at a cost of tens of billions of pounds to the UK Exchequer. It is a situation that appals veteran Labour politician Dame Margaret Hodge, former chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee which is charged with ensuring British taxpayers get a fair deal. In defiance of ministers, Whitehall mandarins and vested interests at Westminster, she spent her five years in the role trying to call some of the world’s biggest companies to account. Now, for the first time, she has written a book detailing the inside story of her dogged battle to force firms to come clean about aggressive tax avoidance. It is a story that lays bare the extraordinary lengths they go to in order to keep their cash out of the public coffers — aided by civil servants and senior tax office officials . . . Dame Margaret Hodge as chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee used her five years as the public spending watchdog to hold some of the world's biggest firms to account GOLDMAN SACHS Believe it or not, the reason I decided to haul the bankers from Goldman Sachs before the committee was because I read Private Eye. It was a decision that was to have far-reaching consequences. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Champagne Shifty: What a shower! Shameless pictures taken... Migrant-traffickers are top security threat: Officials warn... Share this article Share Private Eye had run a story about an elaborate tax-avoidance scheme that had been set up in 1997 by more than 20 investment banks and other companies. By using trusts and paying their British staff off-shore, they’d all avoided paying National Insurance in the UK. Eight years went by before HMRC successfully challenged this ruse — and each company then settled and paid up. Except Goldman Sachs. So the taxman went after the investment bank in court, warning that it would face stiff interest payments on the money owing if it lost. Indeed, this is standard practice. Margaret Hodge investigated claims HMRC did a deal with Goldman Sachs over tax they owed However, Goldman Sachs fought HMRC tooth and nail for a further five years. By April 2010, when they lost at a crucial tribunal, they owed £40 million. The Government was now in a strong position to extract all the money from Goldman Sachs, including the interest. But this didn’t happen. Instead, in November 2010, a secret deal was struck between HMRC and Goldman Sachs that appeared to let the bankers off paying the interest due. It was difficult to establish the facts because any information on tax is deemed confidential. As far as we could make out, the taxpayer had lost between £5 million and £8 million of interest payments in what could only be seen as a ‘sweetheart’ deal. How on earth could this be justified? We asked Dave Hartnett, Permanent Secretary for Tax at HMRC, to explain. But he refused to answer any questions on the grounds of confidentiality, claiming that in any case he’d had nothing to do with Goldman Sachs. Dame Margaret admitted she began investigating the scandal after reading Private Eye It seemed that we had hit an insuperable buffer. But just then I received a big brown envelope from a whistle-blower who worked as a lawyer in HMRC. In the middle of the pile I found a crucial document — the minutes of a meeting between the taxman and Goldman Sachs. What they revealed was astonishing. First, those present at the meeting had talked ‘about a deal on which DH [Dave Hartnett] had “shaken hands” with GS [Goldman Sachs]’. But Hartnett had claimed categorically to the Treasury Select Committee that he’d had nothing to do with the firm’s tax affairs. The leaked minutes also stated that ‘the proposed settlement gave GS [Goldman Sachs] no additional penalty for having resisted for 5 more years’. They also revealed that the bank had been let off paying the interest it owed. Most intriguingly of all, they made it plain that the top lawyer at HMRC, Anthony Inglese — who had been present at the meeting — considered the deal struck with Goldman Sachs ‘unconscionable’. So we now had evidence that the head of tax had misled a parliamentary committee, and that HMRC — against its own guidelines — had agreed to a secret sweetheart deal that its own lawyer disapproved of. Of course, we recalled Dave Hartnett. And I accused him of lying. He denied he had lied, saying he ‘did not deal with Goldman Sachs’s tax affairs in the normal sense’. He insisted he had met with the bankers only once — at the meeting where the strange deal was concluded. In fact, we discovered, he had also enjoyed a free lunch, dinner and reception with Goldman Sachs. Worse, Hartnett was not only the principal official involved in negotiating a settlement with the bank, but he’d also sat on the small internal HMRC committee that vetted and rubber-stamped the deal. So what we had here was a wholly secret process, with inappropriate authorisations, utterly inadequate accountability structures, and relationships between top officials in HMRC and powerful taxpayers that seemed far too cosy for comfort. Despite our best efforts, Hartnett would not explain why he had let the bankers pay back less than they owed. At that point, we decided to call Anthony Inglese, HMRC’s head of law — who had apparently labelled the deal ‘unconscionable.’ I simply wanted Inglese to confirm that the leaked minutes of the meeting with Goldman Sachs were an accurate account. But the lawyer refused to answer questions, claiming he owed his allegiance to HMRC — not Parliament. Frustrated beyond measure at what I viewed as a conspiracy of silence, I asked the committee clerk to fetch a Bible and insisted Mr Inglese give the remainder of his evidence on oath. He had no option but to do so — but said very little more. So what has happened since? At HMRC, little has changed. Senior officials continue to insist they cannot discuss the details of taxpayers’ affairs, whether they’re those of an individual or of a company. Does this lack of openness matter? Yes, because the taxman’s actions and decisions cannot be called to account — and taxpayers therefore can’t be sure that they’re being treated equally. There are two important postscripts to this story. Already angry at the way we’d conducted our inquiry, senior civil servants were particularly incensed by my insistence on Inglese giving evidence on oath. And they fought back with full force. First, the Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell wrote me a letter that was highly critical of the way in which we conducted our inquiries. ‘There is now a serious issue about the way you are perceived by the wider Civil Service, but more especially by the legal community,’ he warned — completely ignoring the apparent discrepancies in Hartnett’s evidence. I assumed the letter was private, but quickly found out it had been agreed by all the permanent secretaries and sent to the Clerk of the House of Commons. I replied saying: ‘It is the duty of the committee to pursue fearlessly the public and taxpayers’ interest whenever and wherever we deem it necessary.’ But that wasn’t the end of the matter. The Civil Service, I discovered, went on to commission a survey on what committee members and senior officials thought of our work. Unknown to them, the researcher attached to their project had once worked with me when I was a minister, and she showed me their responses. Some had likened us to the Red Guards; others labelled me an abysmal failure who was ‘ridiculous’ and ‘heavy-handed’. This didn’t bother me: we had to ask uncomfortable questions, so if they’d liked me, I would have been failing in my job. It was the explicit threat in the final paragraph of their report that left me aghast at their sheer arrogance. This roughly translated as: ‘Shut up or we’ll shut you down.’ The true hero of this tale, of course, is the whistle-blower who sent me the crucial brown envelope. Osita Mba had joined HMRC after training as a barrister and demonstrated strong public service values. He should have been commended for that; instead, he was hounded by HMRC, who wanted to charge him for breaking confidentiality laws. Exploiting powers under legislation brought in to tackle terrorists, they cracked open a locked office cabinet beneath his desk; they hacked into his hard drive; they looked at all his emails; they traced his texts and phone calls; they even examined his wife’s phone records. But they never found evidence to charge him. However, they kept Osita Mba off work for a long time; and when he finally came back, they made his life so intolerable that he decided to quit. To this day, my deepest regret from my time as chair of the Public Accounts Committee is my failure to protect a highly principled individual who refused to collude in a cover-up. STARBUCKS For sheer brazenness, Starbucks couldn’t be faulted. The American multinational had been operating in the UK since 1998, expanding its outlets and growing its business. And every year, bar one, the company claimed it was losing money — which meant it avoided paying corporation tax. Yet, through most of that period, Starbucks had also been assuring investors that its UK business was highly profitable. There was clearly one version of events for the investors, another for the UK tax authorities. So, naturally, I wanted to find out how they managed to convert their UK profits into the losses they declared to the taxman. Starbucks began operating in the UK in 1998 but managed to lose money and avoid paying corporation tax during much of that time by routing cash through their Dutch company  There were three devices they used to shift their profits out of the country, I discovered — all of which are commonly used by multi-nationals. First, the company locates its headquarters in a country that demands little or no tax. Then each outlet in the UK has to pay head office a steep ‘royalty’ — a percentage of its earnings — for using the brand and certain business processes. This is what tax professionals call ‘transfer pricing’ — and a huge industry of accountants, lawyers, bankers and advisers has grown up to facilitate it. In Starbucks’ case, they claimed that their HQ was in Amsterdam, even though the firm’s ‘President for Europe’ was actually based in London. But by doing this, they could legitimately do a deal with the Dutch tax authorities that helped them avoid UK tax. Not only were tax rates lower in the Netherlands, but they had a deal with the Dutch that allowed them to transfer money to the tax haven of Bermuda — where no tax was levied at all. Starbucks claimed of every £100 earned in the UK, £6 had to be sent to the Netherlands as a royalty payment. The company also ordered its coffee from Switzerland to pay less tax For every £100 earned at a Starbucks in Britain, it turned out that £6 had to be sent to Amsterdam. Even HMRC thought this was excessive as ‘royalties’ for the brand, and it cut the amount to £4.70. The second device Starbucks used to shift profits out of the UK was to buy all their coffee beans in Switzerland, another low-tax jurisdiction. As we established at a Public Accounts Committee hearing, however, only 30 staff worked there — and the coffee beans never entered Switzerland. Yet because the coffee was ordered from there, Starbucks outlets in the UK had to pay the Swiss part of the business a 20 per cent mark-up on the original price. That cleverly knocked another chunk off Starbucks’ UK profits — and further reduced the amount of corporation tax payable in the UK. Their third wheeze involved intra-company loans. Any UK Starbucks outlet that needed money was forced by the company to borrow from Starbucks in Bermuda or the Netherlands — at an exorbitant interest rate. In effect, this was simply a device to export profits and avoid tax. As our hearing established, these three strategies had managed to turn healthy UK profits into ‘paper’ losses — while the company itself continued to thrive. The public were understandably outraged, and many started boycotting Starbucks coffee shops. The company’s market share began to plummet. It was then that Kris Engskov, managing director of Starbucks UK, asked to see me. Over a cup of ordinary House of Commons coffee, he told me that Starbucks would voluntarily pay £20 million in corporation tax to the Exchequer. This extraordinary offer simply confirmed my view that the system was broken. Why should Starbucks or any other company be allowed to choose the amount of tax it paid? Surely tax had to be assessed by the tax authorities, not decided on the whims and assessments of the companies themselves? To this day, many people are still boycotting Starbucks. I am myself — and I’ll continue to do so until the company starts paying a fair amount of tax on its UK profits. AMAZON Amazon’s tax arrangements were also mind-boggling. Their particular strategy was to create a complex web of companies. This had one purpose: to convince HMRC that they were not selling goods in the UK, but selling goods from Luxembourg into the UK. They decided to deal with our public hearing by sending a witness who couldn’t answer our questions. Andrew Cecil was their director of public policy. He acted like a nervous rabbit, hesitating with his answers and stumbling over his words. He even claimed not to know the company’s UK sales figures. Amazon also had a complicated tax structure with much of their UK profits routed through Luxembourg by claiming that goods bought here were actually purchased from the continent At the time of our hearing in 2012, one in four books sold in the UK was purchased from Amazon. But Cecil claimed that all the books and other goods bought from Amazon.co.uk were in reality being bought from Amazon’s company in Luxembourg. So what’s in Luxembourg? Not the books and other goods — they’re most likely to be in eight giant warehouses in the UK or possibly in the 20 more across Europe, though customers pay only UK postage rates. In Luxembourg, however, you’ll find only the server for Amazon’s computer. True, 500 people work at the Luxembourg HQ — but this pales into insignificance against the 15,000 employees in Britain. Yet Amazon still continues to claim that no sales take place in the UK — a bogus arrangement that appears to be admissible under international tax rules. It’s well worth it when the UK accounts for around £5 billion in net sales. In 2012, for instance, Amazon’s accounts showed that they’d paid us a risible corporate tax contribution of £2.4 million. That very same year, they received a regional grant from the UK Government for the higher sum of £2.5 million to build one of their warehouses In 2012 Amazon paid £2.4 million in UK corporation tax even though the government offered them a grant of £2.5 million to build one of their large warehouses from a regional fund This was funded, of course, by the UK taxpayer. As far as we could deduce from very opaque figures, Amazon paid only £3 million in UK corporation tax for 2003-2011. During the same time period, the €7.5 billion (£6.34 billion) revenue they filed in Luxembourg didn’t bring much benefit to the people of Luxembourg, either. Amazon claimed their administrative expenses amounted to €7.4 billion (£6.26 billion), leaving them with a minuscule profit. So not only were they telling us that they hadn’t sold anything in the UK, but they appeared to be manipulating their accounts in Luxembourg, too. Amazon also told us that no research and development took place in Britain. This was important, because any suggestion that it did would have undermined their claim that Amazon in the UK was simply providing delivery services for the Luxembourg company. However, one of our committee members, Fiona Mactaggart, happened to be the MP for Slough, where Amazon’s UK headquarters are based. There, she’d been told they were developing new products in the UK. There could be only one conclusion. The structure Amazon had devised, the complex web of companies it controlled, was all about avoiding tax; there was no other commercial purpose. Since our hearing, the EU has challenged Amazon’s tax deal with Luxembourg, and Amazon has announced it is changing its structure. It may even start to pay some tax. But it will continue to hide most of its profits by charging exorbitant fees to UK branches for the right to use Amazon patents. So we’re unlikely ever to get the full tax generated from sales in this country. So what has the UK Government done about all this? It has appointed an Amazon senior executive, Doug Gurr, to the board of the Department for Work and Pensions. Is that really the best we can do? Reward a company that intentionally avoids tax with a top government job as a non-executive director? No wonder people get angry. GOOGLE By contrast with Amazon, the man Google sent to our hearing was unusually open — even somewhat arrogant. Matt Brittin, head of sales and operations in Northern and Central Europe, was quite happy to admit the complex web of companies through which they operated was designed to avoid paying tax. He gave the impression that Google was doing the UK a favour, and clearly had absolutely no intention of expressing any humility or regret about their aggressive tax-avoidance. Like Amazon, Google claimed that they weren’t selling in Britain. Their server was in Ireland, and they were merely selling into Britain. We looked at their figures for 2011. In that year, sales to customers with a UK address amounted to $4.06 billion — or 11 per cent of Google’s business worldwide. Google tried to claim they were not selling in Britain as their European headquarters was in Dublin, however, in 2011 they had sales to UK addresses of $4.06 billion  But the company told HMRC that their sales in Britain were not $4.06 billion (£3.06 billion) but a mere $396 million (£299 million), because the sales were apparently transacted in Ireland. From there, the money went to Google in the Netherlands — through the device of Google Ireland paying a fee for a licence held by Google Holdings Netherlands. The Netherlands Google then passed 99.8 per cent of the money back by paying another fee to another entity in Ireland, called Google Ireland Holdings — which is registered in Ireland, but administered in Bermuda. Confused? I was. It’s precisely this kind of labyrinthine complexity that’s enabled companies such as Google, Amazon and Starbucks to get away with not paying their fair share of tax. Google’s tactics were known in the industry as the ‘Dutch sandwich’ because they enabled the company to avoid both UK corporation tax and Dutch tax. Eric Schmidt, Google’s chairman, openly proclaimed that he was ‘very proud’ of the structure. ‘It’s called capitalism,’ he said. ‘We are proudly capitalistic.’ What did this version of capitalism mean for the British taxpayer? In 2011, the year the UK turnover came to £4.6 billion, they filed losses of £24 million. As a committee, we knew what they were doing was wrong, but there seemed little we could do about it . . . until the whistle-blowers started contacting me. Google's tax strategy was known as a 'Dutch sandwich' as it avoided UK and Dutch tax They were both current and past employees and clients of Google, infuriated by what they felt was misleading evidence given to us by the company. I asked two to come in to see me. Their allegations were serious enough for me to recall Google for another hearing. In a nutshell, they were claiming that Google had been selling in — rather than into — the UK, and was therefore liable for tax. One of the whistle-blowers, Barney Jones, had been employed by Google for four years. From offices in Soho, he’d led a sales team that sold advertising to large UK companies — and he had the documents to prove this. Jones and his team met the clients and their agencies in the UK. The ads were designed by staff based in the UK. The key words that determined the ranking of the advertisements were suggested by UK-based staff. Even the invoices were sent out from London. The other whistle-blower was still working for Google when he met us. As a senior salesman in London, he received bonuses for selling and agreeing deals — as set out on his pay-slips. Later, a third whistle-blower — this time a Google customer — told us that he had been asked to settle his account in sterling with Citibank in London. Not Ireland, you note. So how did Google react to all this devastating evidence? At our initial hearing, Brittin had claimed: ‘Anybody who buys advertising from us in Europe buys from Google in Ireland, from our expert team.’ At the second hearing, he stubbornly stood by those words. He also claimed that there was no substantive research and development activity taking place in the UK. However, we learned from other whistle-blowers that a Google building in Buckingham Palace Road was occupied by hundreds of systems developers. Brittin refused to accept that he had misled the committee. ‘They’re contributing to the development of products, absolutely . . . but the leadership of the products that are being built is in California.’ At The end of one long and frustrating session, I could no longer contain myself. Recalling Google’s own company motto — ‘Don’t be evil’ — I told Brittin: ‘You are a company that says you “do no evil”, but I think you do do evil, in that you use smoke and mirrors to avoid paying tax.’ Not surprisingly, the committee’s unanimous conclusion was that Google was selling in Britain and should pay taxes in the UK. And the British tax authorities? As far as we know, HMRC have yet to do anything about this. Then three years later, Brittin suddenly announced that Google would be paying the UK Exchequer £130 million in tax for the ten years from 2005 to 2015. George Osborne welcomed the announcement as ‘a victory for the Government’. But was it? Google’s offer amounted to £13 million a year over ten years — an effective tax rate of 3 per cent, when every small and medium-sized business was paying 20 per cent corporation tax. This episode confirmed the smug and contemptuous attitude too many multinational businesses have towards the British people. In the past, avoiding tax may have been seen as cool and clever. But I learned from the huge number of letters and emails I received that our investigations had unleashed colossal public anger. David Cameron understood that quite quickly. In his speech to the World Economic Forum in January 2013, he used the Starbucks case to say: ‘There are some forms of avoidance that have become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these raise ethical issues and it is time to call for more responsibility and for governments to act accordingly.’ Of course, actions speak louder than words, but I couldn’t even extract the right words from either Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls or Labour leader Ed Miliband. Following our hearings with Starbucks, Amazon and Google, I’d held meetings with the two Eds’ staff and suggested appropriate policies to promote fairness in the tax system. On one occasion, at a meeting with my researcher, a representative from Ed Miliband’s office argued that my agenda was ‘anti-business’, ‘too complicated’ and ‘not an agenda that was going anywhere any time soon’. From the two Eds themselves, I couldn’t get any response. I suspect that this was because they’d both worked in the Treasury under Gordon Brown. No doubt they were worried that anything they said would shine a spotlight on their own complicit failure to stamp out aggressive tax avoidance when they had the power to do so.

It's been a year since Google updated Chromecast by releasing Chromecast 2 with a new design, improved internals, and a refreshed app. At the Mountain View, CA-based company's October 4 event, it announced a new, third-generation model that supports 4K with HDR and Dolby Vision. Here's everything you need to know about Google's new streaming dongle. Google Chromecast: What is it? Google launched the first Chromecast in 2013. It's an affordable HDMI dongle that lets you wirelessly "cast" content to a television. It basically makes most TVs smart. Then, in 2015, Google launched Chromecast 2. It's faster, more responsive, and just as affordable. And it arrived with an updated Chromecast app that serves as a one-stop shop for finding compatible apps and specific content across those apps. For more information on Chromecast, see Pocket-lint's review of Chromecast 2. Chromecast 2 review: Make any TV smart, effortlessly What is Google Cast for Audio? Chromecast now has a guest mode: Here's how to turn on the feature What is Google Chromecast and why should you care? Roku Streaming Stick vs Google Chromecast Amazon Fire TV Stick vs Google Chromecast vs Roku Streaming Stick Google Chromecast Ultra: What is it? Chromecast Ultra looks just like the Chromecast 2, although it's lost the Chrome logo in favour of a small 'G' to fit in with Google's 'Made by Google' message. Google says it's 1.8x faster than the Chromecast 2, which is ideal because it needs to be able to support 4K Ultra HD streams as well as High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Dolby Vision.  It works in exactly the same way as the Chromecast and Chromecast Audio, you simply need to tap the Cast icon in the compatible app on your smartphone or tablet to send content to the big screen. Google Chromecast Ultra: What does it feature? Google's Chromecast Ultra supports 4K Ultra HD content for the benefit of consumers who've upgraded to TVs that support 4K content. By releasing the Ultra, Google has beaten both Amazon Fire TV Stick and Roku Stick in getting 4K support into a small dongle. Amazon and Roku have boxes that support 4K, but not a dongle that can be hidden away behind the TV. Apple's fourth-generation Apple TV box doesn't support 4K either. The Chromecast Ultra can not only stream content via wi-fi, but also comes with an Ethernet port for a wired, more stable internet connection. This is ideal for 4K Ultra HD streams, as they'll require a higher bandwidth and stronger connection than full HD streams. Google Chromecast Ultra: What does it look like? We'd already seen some leaked renders posted by VentureBeat of the Chromecast Ultra and they were pretty spot on. The new model looks almost identical to the Chromecast 2, with the only major difference being the Chrome logo on the HDMI dongle being replaced by a subtle "G" to fall under Google's "Made by Google" tagline. It's a wise move from Google to use the same design as the Chromecast 2, as the new look makes it easy to squeeze between ports behind your TV. It's a small, plastic, hockey-puck-shaped device with a glossy and colourful front and matte bottom. Google Chromecast Ultra: When will it be available? The Google Chromecast Ultra will be available from November.  Google Chromecast Ultra: How much will it cost? Google has confirmed the Chromecast Ultra will cost £69 in the UK when it goes on sale in November and $69 in the US. You can sign up to a waiting list on Google's Store to be notified when it's available to buy. Want to know more? Browse Pocket-lint's Chromecast hub for the latest and breaking news.

Other than the the picturesque scenery, the vehicles have witnessed a handful of strange scenarios - like a broom wielding woman in an electric wheel chair chasing a duck. In a recent monthly report, Google highlighted a few of these bizarre incidents, which the firm says are key to the cars ability to deal with unpredictable road behavior. Scroll down for video  The handful of strange scenarios seen through the eyes of Google's car reveals these machines need to be fully prepared for situations so strange that most of its creators can't dream them up, such as the woman chasing a duck (featured) WHAT HAS THE CAR SEEN?  In Mountain View, California Google's self-driving car witnessed a broom weilding woman chasing a duck in the ride while riding an electric wheel chair. Another strange incident occurred at an intersection, when three non-related cars each made a turn down a one-way, which was the opposite way they were traveling. However, Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car project, says Austin 'takes the cake'. A group of children were seen playing Frogger around the autonomous vehicle.  A separate occasion, a man came out of nowhere and rolled over the hood of the car - similar to the move in Starksy & Hutch. And finally, a gentleman was so excited to see the Google car on his street that he ran out completely naked.  'On our private test track, we've dreamt up and recreated hundreds of odd scenarios to gauge our car's response, but situations like these demonstrate why public testing of our self-driving cars is important to developing our cars for the road,' Google stated in the firm's March report detailing its autonomous vehicle progress. 'We can try to come up with lots of wacky situations for our cars to handle, but the real world can defy even our wildest imaginations.' This report highlights just how bizarre the human species can be when they think no one is watching. The handful of strange scenarios seen through the eyes of Google's car reveals these machines need to be fully prepared for situations so strange that most of its creators can't dream them up, reports Business Insider. 'Now we have a team of people whose job is to come up with weird stuff and they didn't come up with this,' Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car project, said at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas in March. 'I looked at the DMV handbook and there is no page in there about 'duck in road'. Other than the the picturesque scenery, the vehicles have witnessed a few strange scenarios - like a broom wielding woman chasing a duck in an electric wheel (pictured). Google highlighted a few of these bizarre incidents, which the firm says are key to the cars learning how to react to unpredictable road behavior RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Landmark ruling as Michigan votes to become first state to...

Share this article Share 48 shares 'This really highlights part of the challenge that our vehicles have to generalize what they have seen and deal with unusual situations.' Ursmson continues to explain that when the machines come across something like the duck scenario, it knows what is happening in front of it is not normal. The car slows itself down, lets the event play out and then goes about its way. Another strange incident in Mountain View happened when someone wanted to play a game with the car. 'When I saw this, I thought this is definitely going to be the weirdest thing we see on the road, well I was wrong,' Urmson said in regards to the woman and duck incident. Despite never encountering humans posing as a group of frogs (featured), Google's car still knew how to react, explains the firm. Google gives its car fundamental capabilities that lets them 'see' other people or unfamiliar objects on the road, rather than just teaching the machines how to handle certain situations 'Since then we've seen people play Frogger with our car – please don't.'

Broad themes include: User-centered design Validated learning (build-measure-learn) Exceptional quality Disciplined execution Radical collaboration ...which help us execute against Mozilla's 2016 planning Top Line Guidance areas: Build for Quality Invite Participation Be Clear Compelling and Focused Grow our Influence Prototype the Future Ideas for speakers are solicited from Mozillians on an ongoing basis using this speaker submission form. Preference is given to practitioners i.e. those with hands-on experience in their particular subject area. The speaker(s) will present live from a mozilla office and be streamed to the rest of the offices via Air Mozilla and publicly archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance is 20-30 with remote attendees ranging from 100-200; follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Goal Our goal is to engineer individual connection points and create compelling opportunities beyond day-to-day work for office-based staff to come together in our spaces (in most cases) to share an experience and interact with the those they may not normally work with. Face-to-face chats among people with different skills might spark new ideas, lead to new solutions or at the least, increase workplace camaraderie. Our ultimate goal is to improve performance, innovation and overall engagement. Testimonials "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014. Mozillian Host: Aurelia Moser Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS COMING IN 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 29 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t mozilla: for one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On September 29, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: Currently a senior advisor to Google, from 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others).

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books. Her newest books, published by HarperCollins are What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 (2009), inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity (2012), and Insight Out (2015). She’s been honored to receive significant recognition of her work, including the Gordon Prize from the National Academy of Engineering, the National Olympus Innovation Award, the SVForum Visionary Award, and several university teaching awards.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services. Kirsten holds a BS degree in Finance from USC and an MBA from J.L. Kellogg School of Management. Host: David Slater Questions: Submit questions for Kirsten during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS March 24, 2016: The Role of a Product Manager with Josh Elman, Greylock Partners Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, March 24 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: The Role of a Product Manager - and Everyone Else "The job of a product manager is to help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.” Seems simple - but anyone who has worked on a product knows it’s not. At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Building products with partners, considerably moreso. Varying resources, goals, strategies and cultures pose challenges. But partnering well on products is often worth the effort. This month April Underwood, head of all product & partnerships at Slack, will draw from her experiences at Google, Twitter, Travelocity and more to help us navigate the complexities of marrying products and partnerships. She'll be interviewed by our very own Bertrand Neveux, who has built products with partners for most of his career at and leading up to Mozilla. Speaker: April Underwood is head of Platform at Slack, a messaging platform that has evolved into a diverse ecosystem of partners. There, she drives key growth initiatives and oversees platform products, partnerships, API integrations and developer relations. She previously worked on products for Travelocity, Apple, Google, Climate Corp (Weatherbill). Just before joining Slack, April led teams of Product Managers as Director of Product on Twitter’s fast-growing Advertising (Ads API, ads.twitter.com) and Data (Firehose, Gnip) products. She was also a PM for the Tweet Button and Twitter API, and built Twitter's Business Development team from the ground up to strike strategic partnerships with firms including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, EA, Salesforce and Adobe.

Hashtags: #mozSS #brantina January 27, 2016: The Right Way to Build Software with Jocelyn Goldfein, ex-Facebook Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 27 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: The Right Way to Build Software: Ideals Over Ideology Add-ons. Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups. As Director of Engineering at Facebook she led Facebook’s push on mobile infrastructure and quality, initiating major new investments in architecture and tooling and helped guide Facebook’s transition to “mobile first.” She launched new product initiatives in search, news feed, and photos. She also drove strategic engineering operational initiatives, including overhauling Facebook’s approach to technical recruiting. More on Jocelyn at her website.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mike is also a co-author of the Responsive.org manifesto and a leading contributor to the global self-management and future of work movement.

User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News.

Condom emojis were rejected by Facebook and Google as being "not family friendly". Photo: Supplied / New Zealand AIDS Foundation The foundation has had some of its adds taken down by Google and Facebook because they were not "family friendly". An emoji is a small digital image or icon used to express an idea or emotion in electronic communication. The foundation, alongside condom company Durex, asked Unicode which decides on which new emojis to add for people to use on smart phones and apps to install one of a condom on World Aids Day last year. The bid was denied but the foundation was only told why this week. Aids Foundation spokesman Joe Rich said the bid was denied because it was not supported by industry partners such as Facebook and Google. He said their refusal to install the emoji was extremely irresponsible. Examples of emojis used on Facebook Photo: Facebook "These companies say that promoting condoms is not considered family friendly," Mr Rich said. "We have had our condom and HIV-testing advertisements pulled from Facebook and Google - we want them to step up and take leadership and acknowledge what people are using their platforms for." Mr Rich said when there are emojis for guns, knives and pills it is extremely frustrating a condom emoji is considered unacceptable. He said HIV was on the rise in New Zealand, so talking about safe sex was important now more than ever. "Young people use emojis to depict everyday things and in discussions with friends- so a condom should be added. "People are often surprised when they learn there is not a condom emoji and when we tell them it has been denied they are shocked," Mr Rich said. He said the foundation wanted to put pressure on big tech companies like Apple, Google and Facebook to accept the emoji, and adverts which promote the use of condoms. "It's frustrating - the work we do is hard enough but to not even be able to talk to people on these platforms about safe sex is ridiculous," Mr Rich said.

For the second year in a row, the mega search engine released a fashion trend report, revealing what we search for the most—and what we’re all becoming tired of. At the top of the list of trending items in the U.S. and U.K. are bombers, joined by ripped jeans and biker jackets as close runners-up. Apparently, Gigi Hadid was oft searched for alongside bomber jackets, and Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Kanye West were also frequently associated with the term. The most popular color: black, of course, followed by pink, green, and olive. Sounds about right. MORE: How a $135 Bomber Became the Year’s Most Ubiquitous Jacket Another big winner was the off-the-shoulder top, which has been enjoying some serious staying power. Celebs who appeared in “off-the-shoulder top” searches the most included Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Olivia Palermo, Alexa Chung and Michelle Obama. White was the crowd fave here, trailed closely by black, red, and blue. Though cold-shoulder tops aren’t necessarily gaining in popularity, they’re also not going anywhere: Google searches for such looks have remained steady all year, hinting that you should keep rocking that Bardot top hard, though you don’t necessarily need to feel obligated to rush out and buy five more (especially since fall is en route). Maybe just one. As such, we collated 35 of our favorite bombers and off-the-shoulder tops on the planet right now, including some warmer options (quilted bombers, long-sleeve tops) to keep you covered at least through the autumn. Happy trending, y’all.

In its self-assumed quest to make the internet a safer place for everyone, Google will soon start publicly shaming websites that fail to use the HTTPS protocol for transmitting passwords and other sensitive data. But instead of a scarlet letter, Google will shame them by marking their websites as "non-secure" so users know clearly that their personal data is not being protected adequately. Website owners have until Jan. 1, 2017, to implement HTTPS for transmitting sensitive data. It is after that date that Google's new site labeling policy will go into effect. The move is part of an ongoing effort by the company to get website owners to start using HTTPS, long considered a much safer alternative to HTTP. Eventually, Google will start marking all HTTP sites as non-secure and not just when they fail to use HTTPS to handle sensitive data. "Our plan to label HTTP sites more clearly and accurately as non-secure will take place in gradual steps, based on increasingly stringent criteria," Chrome security team member Emily Schechter wrote on Google's Online Security Blog this week. "Starting January 2017, Chrome 56 will label HTTP pages with password or credit card form fields as 'not secure,' given their particularly sensitive nature." The move to explicitly label sites as being non-secure marks a planned escalation of Google's current practice of using a neutral indicator on Chrome to indicate HTTP connections. Chrome has for sometime now used a green lock icon on sites that use HTTPS to let users know they are on a secure site. According to Schechter, Chrome's neutral indicator does not do enough to convey the seriousness of the security issues caused by plain HTTP connections. But most users do not perceive the lack of a "secure" icon on HTTP sites as a warning and instead tend to ignore it, which is why Google will start marking such sites more explicitly. Subsequent releases of Chrome will extend HTTP warnings by, among other things, labeling HTTP pages as "not secure" even when a user is in incognito mode and has a higher privacy expectation, Schechter said. Eventually, sites that continue to use HTTP will be labeled with a red triangle that Chrome currently uses for HTTPS sites that are not functioning like they should. HTTPS ensures that communications between a user's browser and a website are encrypted using either the Transport Layer Security protocol or the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. HTTPS connections are considered much harder to intercept and to modify compared with HTTP connections. In order to implement HTTPS, site owners need to obtain a trusted digital certificate for their sites. But Google has noted that several providers currently offer free, bundled or cheap certificates. Projects like Let's Encrypt also have made it very easy for site owners to obtain free digital certificates for multiple subdomains, the company has noted. According to Schechter, a substantial proportion of websites already use HTTPS, and use of the protocol has been rising consistently. More than half of Chrome's page loads on desktops are now served via HTTPS, she said.           LATEST SECURITY ARTICLES   IBM Opens New Global Headquarters for Security Services IoT Devices Evolving Rapidly as Favorite DDoS Attack Tool, Experts Say Dell Data Protection Defends Against External, Insider Threats Kaspersky Alleges Microsoft's Windows Defender Is Anti-Competitive Linux Foundation Back Reproducible Builds Effort for Secure Software                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The best laptop you can buy Matt Smith Digital TrendsSeptember 9, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share If you’re looking to buy a laptop right now, the answer is Dell’s XPS 13. It’s light, portable, powerful, beautiful, and reasonably affordable. We recommend it not only over every other Windows notebook, but also Apple’s MacBook line and Google’s Chromebooks. Still, if you insist, we have picked out the best MacBook for OS X die-hards, the best Chromebook for those who desire an affordable laptop with a super-light OS, and the best laptop if you’ve $600 or less to spend. We’ve also selected the best 15-inch laptop — though it, perhaps unsurprisingly, is the Dell XPS 15. Best for most people Dell-XPS-13-Gold-lid2More Why should you buy this: It’s portable, fast, attractive, and reasonably priced. Our Score Dell XPS 13 (Skylake) Portable, powerful, and beautiful, nothing offers the same value as Dell's flagship XPS 13. $1,030.00 from Amazon $1,349.99 from Best Buy Who’s it for: Everyone except gamers. How much will it cost: $800 to $1,600 Why we picked the Dell XPS 13 Dell’s XPS 13 blends a metallic exterior with carbon-fiber interior. It’s a look that’s premium, yet inviting. The XPS 13 is the kind of cool new toy that you’ll be itching to show everyone willing to look. The super-thin InfinityEdge bezel is another highlight. Most laptops have a half-inch to an inch of plastic surrounding the display on all sides. The XPS 13 has less than a quarter of an inch. That’s as functional as it is beautiful, as it makes the system smaller and lighter. Does that make the XPS 13 too small? Nope. The touchpad is as large as the competition and the keyboard is a breeze to use. The system even squeezes in a large battery, which means most models can last a full day before needing a charge (the top-shelf Core i7 model is borderline, though it can manage eight hours if you’re easy on it). There is just one oddity you should know about — the web cam. The bezels are so thin there’s no room for it, so it’s below the display, rather than above. That makes for an awkward angle. Most people won’t care, but it will bug you if you video conference while traveling. Core i3, i5, and i7 processors are available along with a selection of solid state hard drives and up to 16GB of RAM. It doesn’t set any performance records, but it’s on par with other laptops in the category. If you want speed, though, it’s available. The Core i7 models doesn’t have the Core i7-6500U found in most expensive ultrabooks, but instead opts for the Core i7-6560U, which boasts quicker integrated graphics and a higher maximum clock speed. But the XPS 13 doesn’t earn the “best laptop” title because of its premium configuration. The laptop starts at just $800, and can be handsomely equipped for $1,000. These entry-level versions don’t have the fastest available hardware, but they retain the same design, features, and battery life as the most expensive. Nothing else offers the same overall value, and many competitors feel hopelessly out of date when placed next to Dell’s flagship. Before buying, be sure to read our XPS 13 review, as well as our XPS 13 buying guide. The best Mac Apple-MacBook-Pro-13-Ret-2015-inuseMore Read More Why should you buy this: You refuse to use Windows. Our Score Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Retina (2015) Apple’s notebook will appeal to speed demons, videophiles, and anyone who despises the finicky touchpads on Windows. $1,299.99 from Apple Who’s it for: Anyone who refuses to use Windows. How much will it cost: $1,300 to $1,800 Why we picked the MacBook Pro 13-inch with Retina Most people are looking at a Mac for one of two reasons. Either you’re a fan of OS X and refuse to use Windows, or you’re attracted to Apple brand and want to buy one based on the company’s reputation. If you’re in the first group, then nothing we say will sway you. In that case, we recommend you purchase the MacBook Pro — the 13-inch model if you prefer portability, and the 15-inch model if you need power. The Air is ancient, at this point, and frankly should’ve been discontinued last year. The 12-inch MacBook is beautiful, but has some quirks, like a horrid keyboard and a single USB Type-C port for connectivity. If you’re looking at a Mac based on its reputation, we suggest you reconsider. The company has allowed its computers to fall by the wayside. All Mac models equip Intel processors that are one or two generations behind the latest, and the vaunted Retina displays are now equal, at best, to the competition. Mac OS X is a fine operating system that does its job, but we think Windows 10 is even better. Finally, Apple’s laptops are much too expensive for the hardware they offer. Apple does have one big benefit — service. The company tends to cover defective hardware that others might refuse to service, and you can take your Mac to a retail store if you need help. This might sway users who are particularly concerned with potential problems. But a Mac is not bombproof, and most modern laptops can easily last five years. We don’t think fear of an ambiguous future problem that may or may not happen should be what guides your buying decision. The best Chromebook acer-chromebook-15-over-the-shoulder-keyboard-1500x1000More Why should you buy this: You want nice, barebones laptop for less. Our Score Acer Chromebook 15 Looking for a cheap laptop to use as a second PC? You can't go wrong with the Acer. $249.00 from Amazon Who’s it for: Students, people who need only basic functionality, anyone who wants a cheap laptop to use as a second PC. How much will it cost: $200 to $300 Why we picked the Acer Chromebook 15 Chromebooks — laptops that run Google’s Chrome OS — have become a popular budget laptop over the last few years, and we quite like them at Digital Trends. The Acer Chromebook 15 is a great example of their strengths. It has a 1080p display, fast Intel processor, and plenty of memory, all starting at $300 when the product first came out. No Windows notebook priced at $300 comes close. And today you can get it for less even than that. If you’re looking for a budget laptop, Chromebooks are a good choice. But these systems rarely sell for north of $500, with the obvious exception of Google’s Chromebook Pixel, which is too niche for us to recommend. The price brings limitations, of course. You won’t find a Chromebook with a quad-core processor, a fast solid state drive, or an optional discrete GPU. Even if Chromebooks were equipped to compete with the best laptops, the operating system would hold them back. Chrome OS, which is designed around Google’s Chrome Web browser, is wonderfully simple and intuitive, but it can’t run “normal” software. It only runs extensions and Web apps. So while you can access Word Online, for example, you could never install Word. This, of course, means you’re reliant on Wi-Fi access, which isn’t a problem in most situations but becomes a very big problem if the Internet cuts out. Google has upgraded Chrome OS over time to combat this. Now, you can download your Gmail inbox and Google Drive content for offline access. But it’s not enough to make a Chromebook completely reliable. The best budget laptop asus-ux305-desk-1500x1000-3-1500x1000More Why should you buy this: You want an affordable PC that’s also a joy to use. Our Score Asus ZenBook UX305 The Zenbook starts at $600 and has fantastic specs — and far better than what you'll find in other competitors. We're not sure how Asus make... $678.99 from Amazon.com $699.00 from Best Buy Co, Inc. Who’s it for: Everyone except gamers, other power users. How much will it cost: $600 to $800 Why we picked the Asus Zenbook UX305CA The Dell XPS 13 starts at $800. We don’t think that’s a lot for a laptop, but the world obviously disagrees; the average selling price of new laptops has hovered around $600 for years. One option is to watch out for a sale. You shouldn’t have to wait long. Refurbished models have sold for as little as $470, and new systems sometimes dip near the $600 mark. Keep an eye out for coupons on Dell’s site and for sales at major retailers including not just the usual suspects but also the Microsoft Store, which carries a selection of the best Windows laptops. If that doesn’t work, then we suggest the Asus Zenbook UX305CA, another ultrabook we’ve awarded an Editor’s Choice. The Zenbook isn’t as powerful as the Dell XPS 13, and doesn’t emulate the Dell’s strikingly thin bezels. But it’s otherwise an incredible machine. And its value can’t be beat. The base model, which is routinely priced at $600 on the Microsoft Store, has a Core m3 processor, eight gigabytes of RAM, and a 256GB solid state drive. That’s twice the memory and storage of the $800 Dell XPS 13 — and far better than what you’ll find in other competitors. We’re not sure how Asus makes money off it. If you don’t mind spending $50 more, you might consider the Asus Zenbook UX305UA. Only one letter separates its name from the UX305CA, and they’re as similar as that suggests. The UX305UA is slightly larger, slightly heavier, and has a quicker Core i5 processor. These changes make it a better choice for power users. The best large display Dell-XPS-15-2015-featMore Why should you buy this: You want a sleek PC, but also need excellent performance. Our Score Dell XPS 15 Beyond great specs, the Dell XPS 15 can be provisioned with Nvidia mobile graphics and a stellar 4K display. $1,699.99 from Dell Who’s it for: Power users, and those who want a big, beautiful display How much will this cost: $1,000 to $1,650 Why we picked the Dell XPS 15 Okay, the XPS 13 is great. But maybe you want a larger display. You’re not alone. Sales figures have continually shown 15-inch systems beating their smaller rivals. We think this is partially because good, small laptops aren’t cheap — but some people just want a bigger display. There’s nothing wrong with that. Fortunately, Dell also has the XPS 15. It’s great for all the same reasons the XPS 13 is great and, because it’s larger, can be optioned with the fastest hardware available today including a quad-core processor, Nvidia mobile graphics, and a 4K display. We don’t like it quite as much its little brother because it’s quite expensive, and the battery doesn’t hold up as well relative to the competition. But it’s definitely the best 15-incher available right now. The XPS 15 starts at $1,000, though, which is a steep sum. Is there anything more affordable? There is, but nothing stands out as the clear winner. Acer’s Aspire E15 is affordable and powerful, but not attractive. Asus’ X555UB-NH51 looks and feels more luxurious, but is priced higher without a performance bump. Dell’s Inspiron 7000 is a powerful do-it-all entry that can even serve as a budget gaming laptop, but its display is disappointing. Acer’s Chromebook 15 can’t be beat in value, but you have to alright living with Chrome OS. Yes, that’s a lot of options. Picking a budget 15-inch is a tough choice, but if you’re tired of looking and just want a name, go with the Acer Aspire E15 (make sure you buy one with a 1080p display). It’s ugly, but it’ll do the job well enough at an extremely low price. Should you buy now, or wait? Intel has recently announced its new 7th-generation processors. If possible, it’s a good idea to wait until you see an update to the 7th-gen hardware before buying the particular model you have your eye on. But it’s not critical. The new generation isn’t that much quicker than the previous version, and the battery life gain in 7th-gen is minimal. If you can buy a 6th-generation model at a slight discount, or you have reason to believe the 7th-gen update won’t come soon, go ahead and make a purchase. AMD also has new hardware available. While we don’t generally recommend AMD over Intel in laptops, the company’s APUs can make sense in some affordable systems. Keep and eye out for the new chips, which are detailed in this post. Also, this is the holiday buying season. That means a plethora of discounts. A keen eye and quick trigger finger could snag you hundreds of dollars in savings. How we test You’ve read our laptop reviews. You’ve read our conclusions. And now you’re wondering how we came to them. Good question. Reviews often lack context, which is evident in the wildly different scores some laptops receive from different publications. Conflicting opinions can actually make buying a laptop more difficult if the review’s criteria isn’t made clear. Allow us to lift the veil. Here we’ll explain the benchmarks we use for objective testing and the perspective from which we approach subjective topics. We don’t expect everyone to agree with our opinions, but we hope that sharing our process will leave you better equipped to decide what laptop best fits your needs.

While Chrome cannot forbid users from accessing HTTP sites, the web browser can advise them against doing so by marking them to be non-secure. "Chrome currently indicates HTTP connections with a neutral indicator," wrote Emily Schechter, the Chrome Security product manager, in a blog post. "This doesn't reflect the true lack of security for HTTP connections. When you load a website over HTTP, someone else on the network can look at or modify the site before it gets to you." Come January, users of the currently unreleased Chrome 56 will notice a grey “Not secure” warning on HTTP pages that transmit credit card information and passwords. Come January, users of the currently unreleased Chrome 56 will notice a grey “Not secure” warning on HTTP pages that transmit credit card information and passwords. Photo: Google The next step will be implementing the labelling of non secure pages in Incognito mode and later, marking all unencrypted sites with the red triangle icon it uses to reflect a broken HTTPS. Eventually, all unencrypted sites with the red triangle icon it uses to reflect a broken HTTPS. Photo: Google Related Stories Chrome Browser Now Has Google Cast Support Google Experiment Hopes To Prevent Quantum Hacking What’s the difference between HTTPS and HTTP? It all boils down to encryption—or lack thereof. HTTPS—short for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure—ensures that any data exchanged between a user’s browser and website is encrypted. This is imperative for preventing hackers from getting access to sensitive information. HTTP sites, on the other hand, do not offer encryption. As for Google's decision to roll out small changes, Schechter explains that the company will be strategically taking “gradual steps” since studies have found that users “do not perceive the lack of a “secure” icon as a warning” and suffer from “warning fatigue,” which is when they become immune to warnings after being exposed to them too frequently.   Last December, Google gave websites incentive to transition to HTTPS by prioritizing HTTPS pages over HTTP sites. Now, Schechter reveals that over half of the page loads on Chrome are over HTTPS. “We definitely do plan to label all HTTP pages as non-secure eventually,” Schechter told Motherboard. “We really wanted to be careful about it and we wanted to get it right.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Using its “WaveNet” model, Google’s AI company in the UK, DeepMind, claims to have created a natural machine-to-human speech that halves “the gap with human performance." Machine babble often sounds emotionally flat and robotic because it’s difficult to capture the natural nuances of human speech. Many systems are still based on a method called “concatenative text-to-speech” (TTS), which sounds out words by stringing together a large collection of phonetic sounds. Researchers have managed to improve speech synthesis a bit by using “parametric text-to-speech,” which uses a vocoder – a device that employs a set of algorithms to process sounds from speech. Although parametric TTS is more complex than concatenative TTS, the result can be even worse for syllabic languages like English, according to Google. Like many existing AI projects, DeepMind has turned to using neural networks – a system modelled on how the human brain works – capable of processing huge heaps of data to perform a specific task. WaveNet directly models the “raw waveform of the audio signal, one sample at a time.” It requires high computing power, because raw audio produces about 16,000 samples per second at many time scales. The neural network is trained by recording human speech. As the sounds are sampled, a value is “drawn from a probability distribution computed by the network.” The value is then pumped back into the input and the system has to predict the next step for each sample. Building up these samples from a wider range of human voices makes the result more realistic. Google DeepMind claims that using WaveNet in US English and Mandarin Chinese has closed the gap between human and AI speech by 50 per cent, according to mean opinion scores calculated by subjective evaluation. After training, to transform text to speech, WaveNet has to first process the text. The words in the text are unscrambled into a “sequence of linguistic and phonetic features” that feeds into the neural network. Training WaveNets without text results in gibberish. The AI system has to make it up as it goes along, stringing together human-sounding noises that don’t make any sense. In DeepMind’s blog post, it hasn’t said how this technology will be applied. But the team has used it to produce AI-made piano music. You can hear how the AI speaks and makes music here. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 32 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Resend activation e-mail Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism Two critical bugs and more malicious apps make for a bad week for Android Google releases fixes for newer devices and ejects apps following reports. by Dan Goodin - Sep 9, 2016 8:22 pm UTC Login to bookmark 178 Ron Amadeo It was a bad week for millions of Android phone users. Two critical vulnerabilities were disclosed but remain unpatched in a large percentage of devices, while, separately, malicious apps were downloaded as many as 2.5 million times from Google's official Play Marketplace. The vulnerabilities, which are similar in severity to the Stagefright family of bugs disclosed last year, have been fixed in updates Google began distributing Tuesday. A large percentage of Android phones, however, aren't eligible to receive the fixes. Even those that do qualify don't receive them immediately (the September updates are currently not available as over-the-air downloads for either of the Nexus 5X devices in my household). That gives attackers crude blueprints for exploiting vulnerabilities that remain unpatched on millions of devices. "Extremely serious bug" The first vulnerability was disclosed by Mark Brand, a researcher with Google's Project Zero security team. Indexed as CVE 2016-3861, it allows attackers to execute malware or escalate local privileges on vulnerable phones. Brand warned that it's "an extremely serious bug" because it can be exploited in a large variety of ways. He also said CVE 2016-3861 wasn't particularly hard to detect, a finding that increases the chances that other researchers already knew about it. (In any event, Brand included proof-of-concept exploit code with his disclosure. A Google spokesman said the exploit was for research purposes, worked only on an undisclosed subset of Nexus devices, and "could not be used in real world attacks without substantial modification and even further research.") Brand didn't say exactly which Android version introduced the code-execution vulnerability, but he indicated that it's present in at least several of the most recent releases. "The provided exploit performs this on several recent Android versions for the Nexus 5x and is both reliable and fast in my testing," he wrote in a blog post published Wednesday. "It would also be possible to make the exploit faster by directly generating the exploit files in javascript, reducing the unnecessary network round-trips [spent] retrieving identical mp4 files." The same Android update patches a separate critical vulnerability that's similar to Stagefright. Cataloged as CVE-2016-3862, it can be exploited by sending a maliciously formatted jpeg image. When sent through Gmail or Google Talk, the malicious code is concealed inside Exif data embedded in the image. The target doesn't need to click on anything to become compromised. "To an advanced attacker, this was relatively easy to find and in their wheelhouse to exploit," Tim Strazzere, director of mobile research at SentinelOne and the researcher who reported the bug to Google, told Threatpost. "You would have access to anything that app had access to or leverage another exploit to get system privileges or root." The vulnerabilities were made public the same week that security firm Checkpoint disclosed that recently discovered apps, some available since April, had been downloaded from Google Play as many as 2.5 million times. One malware family dubbed DressCode was likely used to generate fraudulent clicks on ads, but Checkpoint researchers said it could also be used to breach internal networks and retrieve sensitive files from them. DressCode was found in more than 40 Google Play apps that had been downloaded from 500,000 to 2 million times. In a separate post published Thursday, Checkpoint disclosed an app that contained code that redirected infected phones to websites that generated fraudulent revenue. Known as CallJam, the malware also included code that called fee-based premium phone numbers, although this ability was only invoked after receiving permission from end users. CallJam was embedded into an app called "Gems Chest for Clash Royale," which was downloaded from 100,000 to 500,000 times. The app, as well as those containing DressCode, were removed from Play following the posts. Post updated on September 10 to add details in the third paragraph about the proof-of-concept exploit. Expand full story Promoted Comments bvz_1 Ars Scholae Palatinae jump to post I know that by now this is getting to be a tired refrain, but until phone reviews put updates at or near the top of their scoring we are never going to get this problem fixed. For example every single review of every single Motorola device should start with: "We cannot recommend any Motorola phones because of Lenovo's corporate policy of not providing timely updates for serious security issues once phone have been purchased by customers. If data security is not an issue that concerns you, by all means continue reading this review." Of course, Google has to take some serious steps to make more of the underlying code updatable via the play store as well. Finally, and this is well beyond the scope of anything that will ever happen, Android has to be redesigned such that it is an installable OS much like Windows or Linux. I have heard that Linux (and therefore Android) has a Kernel that makes this much more difficult to do for all the various hardware combinations out there... but it has to be doable. Maybe the core of Android just becomes a compiler specific to that hardware, and Android itself is released as source code that gets recompiled on install? I am not technical enough to know if this is even possible. But something has to be done. In the mean time, Nexus. Or if you are rich enough and it floats your boat, iPhone. Nothing else seems like it would be a viable alternative. And woe be to you if you cannot afford one of these two. In that case you are simply going to be vulnerable. 629 posts | registered 3/5/2009 cdillon Smack-Fu Master, in training et Subscriptor jump to post logic_88 wrote: cdillon wrote: I still haven't received the September 6 OTA update on my Nexus 6P.

If you want to jump the queue, grab the OTA from Google's site. https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/a ... 3f6b27.zip Thanks for the link. I completely understand the reasoning for slowly spreading the larger updates, like the roll-out of Nougat. The company I work for does exactly the same thing with their software, and the major version updates are spread out about a week. We do not, however, spread out the security updates. They're available to everybody at the same time and will be installed according to their usual (daily) auto-update schedule, or can be installed instantly just by triggering a manual update. A little bit of spread is OK, but the update window for the security fixes is a little bit too large if it hasn't made it out to everybody within a couple of days. 61 posts | registered 7/18/2010 Reader comments 178 You must login or create an account to comment.

Your audience is the most important aspect of your digital marketing campaign. A trend you’ll see continue to rise in 2016 and beyond is designing a user experience. As you’re designing a website or mobile app for your brand, ask yourself if your users will have a memorable experience and whether your message will leave an impact. User experience testing and practicing is no longer optional. As quickly as a user finds your website, they will just as quickly bounce and move on if they don’t have the experience they hoped. It starts with usability, cleanliness, and the value it brings to your audience. But it’s so much more than that. All aspects of your website contribute to the overall experience. Every business and every website you interact with has their own way of expressing themselves. How are you going to make sure your voice is heard and your customers find what they need on your website? User Experience Defined If you ask Google what user experience is, they answer your question with “the overall experience of a person using a product such as a website or computer application, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to use.” In terms of evaluating your user experience, analyze how your visitors are interacting with the site. How do they navigate across the site? Look at how they consume content and how the design is working. What’s appealing your customers? UX design works when you allow your customers to complete actions or find information as quickly as possible. When complying with the definition provided by Google’s answer box, you have the capability of expanding your business by appealing to new, pleased customers. Guide the user through the funnel, helping them to achieve their goals while exceeding your goals. Aspects Incorporated Into the Experience When you land on a website, what’s the first thing you’re looking for? Accessibility, usability, value or credibility, or a heading tag showing what the page is about. All of your customers are looking for something unique. The experience starts with a usable design, appealing to the emotions and behaviors of your audience: Appearance Tone of Voice Visual Design & Layout Consistency Clear Call to Action Page Load Speed In order to truly draw your users in, explore the use of clean concepts paired with appealing images and powerful content. Avoid any distractions that negatively affect engagement and are not necessary to your end-user. Make sure your users can easily find relevant information to quickly make decisions. The ability to interact with your brand and your website captures attention and leaves your users with a positive experience. All elements of the interface make up the design. Establish trust for your brand by simplifying your interface, offering easy navigation, and quick answers to any concerns your visitors have. Always continue to look for ways to improve the end-user experience. Test data sets and gather feedback from your customers, family, and friends. A/B Testing You may think that your design is appealing and attractive, yet your traffic and conversions haven’t increased. You never know how your visitors will be interacting with your brand. Test different variations of page designs to see which performs best with your audience. Look at various factors and leverage how you can increase visibility of particular elements to gain more interaction. Which elements need to pop? Your call to action, contact information, icons, and heading tags. Make sure they stand out. What Should You Test? Look at aspects of your site that have a high impact on your visitors. Alter the color schemes and the wording of your call to action buttons. Use clear icons, attractive colors, and different fonts for your text. Focus on the user. Your users are looking for two things from your website: Simplicity Helpfulness Test your landing pages and see which designs draw the most attention and interaction from your visitors. There are many tools and software you can use for your A/B Testing. Try Optimizely to see which areas of your website have the highest engagement levels. The purpose of A/B Testing is to find issues and problems, and eliminate them from your design. How are you going to increase performance of your website? A/B Testing gives you the information you need to identify any problems so you can increase click-through rates and generate business. How Do You Generate Business From User Experience? A first impression makes all the difference. Perception is everything. Enhance your marketing by focusing on UX design. Be consistent across channels. Make sure the experience between desktop, tablet, and smartphone remains the same. As close to 75% of your consumers are accessing your website on a mobile device, your mobile experience should enable action triggers that increase conversions. Create a buyer persona for your brand to look at your website from a conversion and user standpoint. Applying UX design to your marketing campaign benefits greatly from user personas, laid out by MarketingProfs. Once you have a positive perception through user experience, you’ll add positive associations and enhance your reputation. Decisions to buy your product or request your services depends on customer experience. When you optimize the experience, you’ll stand out ahead of your competitors. Optimizing your site will result in: Reduced Bounce Rate More Page Views More Contact Boxes Filled Out Increased Sales When your website performs efficiently and is clear and concise, action will be persuaded. In turn, business will be generated. The SEO Relationship Your SEO campaign and UX design go hand in hand. Going back to the aspects of page load speed and a clear, simple CTA, these factors matter too in SEO. As outlined by Search Engine Watch, SEO has as much to do with how users engage on a site as it does with rankings. Higher traffic and better user experience leads to more links, shares, and higher rankings. Your SEO will benefit from a pleasurable user experience, but only if the two are aligned. Optimizing your on-page factors with highly relevant and compelling content, together with a user-friendly and appealing design, leads to successful digital marketing. Be sure to avoid both UX and SEO issues with redirects or re-branding your business. Focusing too much on UX can result in a dip in rankings and traffic. On the other hand, too much focus on optimization and not experience will increase your bounce rate and hinder user engagement. With the same business goals in mind, make sure your SEO staff and UX team work together to find the balance that results in increased traffic and conversions. Identifying Problems Are you failing to gain traffic and revenue from your website? Put yourself in the frame of mind of your target users. Understand what they’re looking for and why they’re visiting your website. What are the issues you’re dealing with? Look into the analytics of your website and landing pages, searching for key metrics that help you identify problems. Analytics for customer journeys enables you to find opportunities for improvement and quickly correct any problems. Time on Site How long are visitors on your site? Are you capturing their attention long enough to make your voice heard? Design and experience keeps visitors interested. If they aren’t staying on your site now, enhance and simplify the design and get them to stay. Bounce Rates An optimized UX design encourages visitors to explore your website. Without a captivating design, your visitors will lose interest and bounce. Think about the last time you updated the design. If it’s outdated and doesn’t pop, your visitors won’t view you as a credible source for information or trust your services. This leads to a high bounce rate (when a user lands on your site and immediately leaves). Consistent updates will help lower your bounce rate. Do this effectively by updating your content, improving page load speed, and offering simple navigation. It all begins with an investment in a design that provides trust. UX Surveys You should never stop testing and gathering information about your website. Feedback surveys can deliver valuable information that will help you design a more appealing website for your users. As laid out by KISSmetrics, keep the surveys short and ask only what you need to know. Offer options to garner the most truthful results and feedback. User feedback is key. According to MarketingProfs, “You can’t create a satisfying user experience without actively and consistently gathering user feedback.” Surveys help put you into the minds of your consumers and learn how your site impacts them. Use this information to identify issues and create a positive experience. Exit Pages It’s always good to look at all angles. A few quick exits may not be cause for alarm. Your competition could be visiting your site and leaving without converting. That’s not a problem with your design. Looking further into the exit pages, determine whether important pages of the conversion funnel have a high exit rate. If so, you should be concerned. Analyze each page with a high exit rate. Does it offer value and present your information in an engaging manner? Is there potential to give your users further value on these pages? A good design will solve your problems and the problems experienced by your customers. Through simple navigation and usability, your design will attract the right audience and establish the trust that leads to further business. Brands Doing it Right Get an idea of the types of designs that provide a positive experience. Think about your goals and your target audience, providing an easy solution for increased conversions. Here are brands that have seen success after adjusting their design and interface for the best UX possible. Virgin America Reinventing the flying experience, Work & Co simplified and redesigned the Virgin America website in 2014 to simplify the booking experience. It’s a clear structure that is not cluttered so your eyes focus on the important information. All of your needs are above the fold for easy booking and no distractions. Travelers are busy and Virgin America created a design that responds beautifully to their behaviors. It’s responsive, loads quickly, and meets the needs of travelers quickly with its basic nature. Airbnb When you visit Airbnb, you’re looking for a place to stay. The design is welcoming, easy to use, and offers convenient navigation. Wherever you’re going, Airbnb lets you know right away that they have the destination you’re seeking. For new users, you can browse all available host houses before logging in and creating an account. The team of designers at Airbnb look to impact all aspects of your journey. From the mobile app to the website, each visit is personalized and invites you to keep scrolling. High engagement leads to more interaction, more returning visitors, and more conversions. The focus on UX is a leading factor that helped grow the company to over $10 billion. LA Times As one of the leading sources of news in the entire country, the LA Times shifted to a focus on experience. The bold design puts the focus on multimedia and it’s fully responsive, transforming how its users consume news. Reaching the user with their interface and the advertiser with their design improves the experience for all visitors. They set the standard for today’s news consumption with its mobile-first design that is visually striking and simple to navigate. The company responded to a shift in the industry and appealed to their users by providing a design that connected with the tendencies of their audience. They looked at the problems both readers and advertisers were experiencing, and developed a responsive solution that solved those problems. It has resulted in more engagement and more page views per visit. As UX stays on the road to a multi-channel and multi-device accessibility, you’ll have new opportunities to design an interactive app or website. Give your users a sense of control with an empowering UX and take some advice from these brands to give yourself a competitive advantage. Key Takeaways Creating a memorable user experience results in a significant ROI for your business. UX is a benefit to your brand. The best way to attract repeat customers and grow your business online is by continually testing. Test daily, weekly, or monthly. Your first impression needs to resonate. Appeal to your visitors, and focus on optimizing the experience and the value of your site for increased exposure to the right audience. Find out what’s connecting with your audience and deliver a desirable design. Do just a little more than the rest, and explore new ways to personalize your brand. Through your website and mobile app design, think about the experience you are providing. This will lead to more downloads, more visits, and more interaction with your brand. Use multiple approaches and methods to deliver your message to your audience. Provide easy navigation with a clean design that drives engagement. Engage users with top of fold elements to keep them scrolling through your site. Designing an excellent experience is crucial. The internet is too crowded to blend in. The more consistent of an experience you create, the more you’ll reach your audience. The experience will always be present. How are you going to make that experience positive?   Image Credits Featured Image: Image by Gabrielle Frake. Used with permission. In-post Photos: Images by Gabrielle Frake. Used with permission.

SUBSCRIBE Tips for when and how to use Feed Rules in Google Merchant Center With more functionality now available in Feed Rules, here is a look at how some marketers have been using them to improve Google Shopping campaign performance. Ginny Marvin on September 9, 2016 at 12:07 pm More With Google’s roll out of the new Merchant Center interface came more functionality for Feed Rules. Feed Rules debuted earlier this year to allow marketers to make some changes to their product feed data right within Merchant Center. But what can you really do with Feed Rules and who should be using them? The consensus is that Feed Rules are still best for simple updates, and it’s ideal to make changes to the actual feed. In reality, however, that’s not always possible or timely and why Feed Rules have such appeal. Maggie Webb, Partner at Five Mill Inc., says that while most fixes and feed updates require editing by a feed service or developer, Feed Rules can offer a fix in the interim and be a big help to smaller businesses that don’t have resources at the ready to make updates. “Since a high percentage of ecommerce traffic is from Google Shopping, even a simple change from a Feed Rule can make a big impact on an account,” says Webb. Add missing required data For example, Webb has used Feed Rules to pull a Disapprovals report and manually manipulate best selling and top performing products that are missing required information with an if/then statement in Feed Rules. Here’s what that kind of rule would look like to assign a GTIN to a product using the ID: Webb has also used Feed Rules to create new Custom Labels in order to restructure Shopping campaigns, and to create product filters for Dynamic Remarketing ads. Populate Custom Columns for better campaign structure In an account that had a poor PLA structure because the Product type column wasn’t being used effectively (it just reused what was in the Google Product Category), Webb set up rules to populate the Custom Column 0 field in a way that would allow her to structure the Shopping campaigns more effectively. She created rules to pass the most granular level of the Google Product Category field to Custom Column 0. “This allowed for a hierarchy of bidding based on grouping products based on their category taxonomy, then by product brand within that category taxonomy and then by individual Product ID,” says Webb. For Example : If Google Product Category = Apparel & Accessories > Shoes > Athletic Shoes & Sneakers > Athletic Shoes > Cycling Shoes , Then, Custom Label 0 = Cycling Shoes. That rule would look like the first example in the screenshot below:   The new Custom Column enabled Webb to restructure the campaigns to be able to set bids based on Cycling Shoes, Brands within Cycling Shoes and the Product IDs within those Brands in Cycling Shoes.   Assign a common identifier to be able to group products together The client that needed a subset of products filtered out of their Dynamic Remarketing ads had no common identifier in the feed that could be used to remove them. Webb created a new Custom Label by manually inserting a value based on the product IDs to filter out the unwanted products without having to wait for manual changes to the feed. Speed up promotion updates With the holidays coming up, Kirk Williams, founder of Zato Marketing, points to using Feed Rules for promotion updates. “I love having the Promotion ID feed field editable in the GMC UI now,” says Williams “Before, even for simple edits, I would have to contact the client and rely on the speed of their dev team to add that field into the feed. Now I can go in, set it correctly, create the Promotion ID in the Promotions tab and I’m done!” (Note, if you’re not already signed up for Promotions, you can do so from the Merchant Center Programs page found by clicking on the three-dot icon in the upper right corner of Merchant Center.) Caveats Todd Bowman, Director of SEM and Feeds at Merkle, thinks Feed Rules can be very beneficial with retailers with small and simple feeds, but points to limitations for larger retailers. For example, it can take a few hours to apply new rules to larger feeds, according to Google, and there isn’t a way to combine feeds from separate data sources with Feed Rules. Retailers with hundreds of thousands of SKUs and possibly hundreds of optimization rules are still going to be best served by feed management providers and agencies like Merkle that can push out large, complex feeds in less than 20 minutes, says Bowman. You can find more details on the updated Feed Rules in the Adwords help center.

Barb Palser on September 9, 2016 at 10:25 am More Users swipe through content from multiple publishers in Google’s Top Stories AMP viewer. By now most publishers should be aware of Google’s imminent plan to surface Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMPs) throughout mobile search results. AMP links will no longer be limited to the Top Stories area of mobile results; instead, Google will link to the AMP version of a webpage any time a valid AMP is available. This “blue links” expansion will dramatically increase AMP traffic overall and enable discovery of a rapidly growing universe of non-news and long-tail AMP content.

SUBSCRIBE Digitizing traditional marketing methods to compete in local search Columnist Lydia Jorden discusses techniques to digitize traditional marketing in a way that allows your brand to connect with its traditional audience while maintaining competitive local SERP positioning. Lydia Jorden on September 9, 2016 at 11:19 am More For local brands and companies, it can be hard to initially bridge the gap between traditional and digital marketing. Many local companies, even very successful ones, see more value in traditional marketing methods than inbound digital engagement. Recently, we’ve seen brands increase local search performance by digitizing traditional marketing methods, translating offline to online marketing. Local businesses that are struggling to understand how to make the move from traditional to digital can follow a few strategies. Use hashtags correctly In early 2015, Google and Twitter partnered in a way that allowed Google to collect information and have access to Twitter’s data stream. This means that if your local campaign is running on hashtags across various digital touchpoints (mainly Twitter), you can use this to increase the strength of your local search presence. Work on incorporating hashtags into printed and other materials to encourage your audience to take the conversation online. The hashtag you create should incorporate a keyword with high search volume that speaks to your brand and the goal of your campaign. Red Door Interactive focused on running a campaign that bridged the gap between traditional and digital marketing using hashtags. It ran a campaign for ASICS that created a seamless offline to online digital experience to connect with the local New York and runner community to garner local interest during the 2015 TCS New York Marathon. Red Door Interactive’s push to elevate ASICS in the local search landscape developed with harnessing the importance of race day supporters. Knowing that supporters hold up encouraging signs to runners, a sign generator was created so that supporters could customize and print their own signs. The community was able to customize signs for the race online, share the signs to various social networks with the hashtag #GoRunIt, and finally print the signs which accomplished bridging the gap between offline and online. Lisa Brown, a real estate agent, shows this practice in a more local environment. She created a hashtag for her real estate services and found a way to digitize traditional marketing by including the hashtag on her billboard. Furthermore, she has found a creative way to understand some of the ROI that the billboard offers using digital marketing. Those who submit a photo of the billboard and follow her on a social channel are entered into a contest. When the hashtag is seen in printed material, the audience understands that using that hashtag within posts or conversations online can help further engage with the brand or others searching on the hashtag. Garner inbound links and press around an event As you develop a product or event for your local brand, think about how the PR surrounding it can be translated to digital. According to Moz’s 2015 Local Search Ranking Factors survey, link signals are among the top ranking factors for local SEO, and we can use this information to our advantage. Go to the press, or submit press releases through paid providers (PRweb.com, for example) to increase inbound links to the site. Your website’s domain authority will increase depending upon how credible and trusted the websites are that provide you with an inbound link. Developing an event or product that is worthy of press can help increase inbound links to your site which works to increase positioning in the local pack. Take what you’ve done offline, and make something noteworthy of it that people will want to write about. Then measure the inbound link benefits and see how it translates to elevating local search performance. Pursue inbound links from people already talking about you Find sites that mention your business, and reach out to the webmaster for links to your site. After all, if a website is mentioning your company, you should be getting an inbound link from them to help increase your local SEO. You can find sites that mention you by going to Google.com and typing in the name of your business in quotes. From here, identify listings where a site mentioned your business but did not link back to you. Identify that site’s domain authority to determine how important it is to garner a link from the site. If you find that the site has substantially high domain authority, it is worth investing your time into garnering a link from the webmaster. The example used below is from Blue Bottle Coffee. This is the type of search I would perform if I was wanting to find listings where Blue Bottle Coffee is mentioned within the past month: Create an incentive for your audience to get digitally involved Maintaining a relationship with your audience online is critical for a variety of reasons. Updating your customers on new products, services, or sales can all be done at little to no cost, on a moment’s notice, and excite conversation around your brand. For local businesses with a loyal following, it can be hard to get customers to engage online. Recently, we’ve seen more local businesses prompting their customers to bridge the gap between online and offline. The Backporch Café, a local restaurant to Fort Collins, works to get its customers online in an effort to bring its food to the forefront of people searching for restaurants in the specific area. In the image below, we see that The Backporch Café is working to gain more impressions online through social media by encouraging current customers to post a photo of a meal and use branded hashtag. While this may not directly lead to gains within Google’s local pack, anything that increases a business’s visibility online has the potential to indirectly impact local SEO efforts. By spreading brand awareness, you can increase searches for your business and improve site authority through inbound links. Get started We rarely think about how we can improve local search performance by digitizing traditional efforts. However, connecting your offline and online marketing strategies can significantly help increase local search optimization efforts and connect a more traditional audience to the online world. With competition as fierce as it is within local search, we need to find ways to improve local search performance without sacrificing those who respond to traditional marketing. Start with some of the techniques discussed above, and work from that to a larger offline-to-online campaign to help strengthen local impressions. When a campaign’s purpose is to drive digital local engagement and increase local search positioning across directory sites, continue to think about how your brand can begin to digitize its traditional marketing.

Share Roma Panganiban filed under: Big Questions, books, literature Image credit:  iStock Like us on Facebook When Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in 1440, he couldn’t have foreseen how his humble creation would eventually lead to a global industry churning out millions of books each year. In the centuries since, new books continue getting published while old books pile up so that the total number of books that exist would be inconceivable to a man who placed every letter by hand. While counting up all the actual individual texts populating bookstores, public libraries, and private collections throughout the world would be a Sisyphean task, there might be a way to at least approximate how many unique book titles have ever been published. Trying to determine how many books there are first raises a deceptively simple question: What is a book, anyway? That can get deeply philosophical very quickly, and there’s no single answer to it. The team behind Google Books (whose ambitious goal is to digitize all printed material, allowing unprecedented access to the world’s knowledge in a single database) came up with their own definition in 2010, in an attempt to answer this thorny query: What they refer to as a “tome” comprises an “idealized bound volume,” covering the range from a bestselling novel with copies available at every airport newsstand to a rare, leather-bound out-of-print edition to a single catalogued manuscript of someone’s PhD dissertation going quietly unread in a university collection. On its surface, this definition replicates the concept underlying International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN), the universal identifiers for all books in the commercial marketplace. However, ISBNs have only existed since the mid-1960s and have yet to be widely adopted in non-Western regions of the world, so relying solely on that single number omits vast portions of printed material. Even when they are used, the process of assigning ISBNs isn’t particularly rigorous, so plenty of “book-like objects” that are definitely not books come with an ISBN: audiobooks, instructional DVDs, flash cards, etc. Relying solely on ISBNs to determine the number of published books offers a murky, unsatisfying answer. Other institutions have attempted to standardize their comprehensive book catalogs, among them WorldCat and the Library of Congress, but these numbers are even more likely to be assigned in multiples to the same titles due to different cataloguing rules. Simple titles, author names, and publishing companies are less reliable still, as human error in transcribing all that information into a database can also lead to duplicates. The success of Google Books’s attempt at solving this problem takes into account all these various shortcomings, and uses them to cross-reference nearly a billion raw records from 150 distinct providers to narrow down the number to just one of each book. After weeding out all the assumed duplicates, there are still certain non-book entries that need to be discarded, including two million videos, two million maps, and a turkey probe that was once added to a library card catalog as an April Fools' Day joke. All told, Google Books came up with—drumroll, please!—129,864,880 books total. Phew. But wait, there’s more! Despite Google’s best efforts, their algorithm fails to account for certain crucial factors: Not only is their calculation outdated, having been tallied in 2010, but it predates the recent surge in self-publishing, especially in digital formats. Though ISBNs are recommended for all titles, they are not required for self-published works carried in most e-book marketplaces, and there is no reliable system for keeping track of them otherwise. As the popularity of self-publishing increases, with nearly half a million new titles released in 2013 alone, the Google Books algorithm only gets further from reality. Until Google updates its methodology, we can at least do a little extrapolation with the data we have to figure out a more accurate number of published books in existence in 2016. It’s a moving target, relies on unreliable ISBNs, and will require some educated guessing along the way, but here it goes anyway. According to Bowker, the organization responsible for keeping track of all newly assigned ISBNs in the United States, the years 2011 to 2013 saw the publication of nearly one million new titles (and maybe a few reprints). A U.S. Industry and Trade Outlook statistic indicates that the United States produces about 40 percent of the world’s printed material; if it would be fair to assume that the U.S. is responsible for a similar percentage of non-printed text, it becomes possible to estimate a figure for total global book production, which comes out to about 2,267,265 new books published worldwide from 2011 to 2013. More recent data is hard to come by, so the best way of filling in the gap between 2013 and now may be to average book production over the last three years (755,755 new titles annually worldwide) and add that to the 2013 total. After some basic arithmetic, it seems that a low threshold for the number of unique books in existence as of halfway through 2016 is (another drumroll, please) 134,021,533 total.

Because web traffic transmitted over HTTP is not encrypted, it can be monitored -- or even changed -- by an attacker. Google's announcement is part of a long-term strategy to motivate users and content providers to migrate away from transmitting unencrypted web content. "Beginning in January 2017 (Chrome 56), we'll mark HTTP sites that transmit passwords or credit cards as nonsecure, as part of a long-term plan to mark all HTTP sites as nonsecure," Emily Schechter, a product manager in the Chrome security team, wrote on the Google Security Blog. "Chrome currently indicates HTTP connections with a neutral indicator. This doesn't reflect the true lack of security for HTTP connections. When you load a website over HTTP, someone else on the network can look at or modify the site before it gets to you." The plan to move away from HTTP is ongoing. "In following releases, we will continue to extend HTTP warnings, for example, by labelling HTTP pages as 'not secure' in Incognito mode, where users may have higher expectations of privacy," Schechter wrote. "Eventually, we plan to label all HTTP pages as nonsecure, and change the HTTP security indicator to the red triangle that we use for broken HTTPS." Previous steps in the campaign to improve Chrome browser security included Google's launch of its Certificate Transparency Report. Google -- and other leading browser providers -- has also been removing support for other deprecated or insecure protocols and algorithms, including SHA-1, RC4 and SSLv3. Eventually, all pages that use HTTP will display a warning in Google's Chrome browser. "Google is taking a great step toward improving security on the web by alerting users to websites that are using weak encryption that endangers security and privacy. It remains to be seen if users will pay attention," said Kevin Bocek, vice president of security strategy and threat intelligence at Venafi, based in Salt Lake City. "Unfortunately, many organizations are struggling to keep up with Google's efforts to increase authentication, confidence and privacy. Many organizations still blindly trust all encrypted traffic, even though we know that cybercriminals have been able to subvert encryption in a variety of cyberattacks. As far back as 2012, a broad range of industry voices, including Gartner, started sounding the alarm on this topic, but, so far, most organizations have been less than responsive." In other news: The FBI has arrested two more of the "Crackas with Attitude," who last year managed to create a stir after they hacked CIA Director John Brennan's AOL account. The U.S. Attorney's Office of the Eastern District of Virginia announced in a press release that two North Carolina men had been arrested in connection with their alleged roles in the hacking of several senior U.S. government officials and U.S. government computer systems. According to charging documents filed with the court, the two conspired with other members of the group from about October 2015 to February 2016, using "'social engineering' hacking techniques, including victim impersonation, to gain unlawful access to the personal online accounts of senior U.S. government officials, their families and several U.S. government computer systems. In some instances, members of the conspiracy uploaded private information that they obtained from victims' personal accounts to public websites; made harassing phone calls to victims and their family members; and defaced victims' social media accounts. At least three other members of the conspiracy are located in the United Kingdom and are being investigated by the Crown Prosecution Service." According to research from the German security consulting firm SEC Consult, millions of internet-facing devices are still sharing private keys, and the problem has gotten 40% worse over the past nine months. The research discovered millions of routers, modems, internet gateways and other embedded devices use secret keys and certificates that have been improperly baked in to firmware images to allow access to SSH and HTTPS for remote management of devices. "The number of devices on the web using known private keys for HTTPS server certificates has gone up by 40% in the last nine months (3.2 million in November 2015 vs. 4.5 million now)," SEC Consult wrote. Google finished patching four vulnerabilities, collectively dubbed Quadrooter, in Android devices using Qualcomm chips. Two of the four vulnerabilities (CVE 2016-2503 and CVE 2016-2504) were patched in Google's Android Security Bulletins for July and August; the last two (CVE-2016-2059 and CVE-2016-5340) were patched in the September bulletin. As many as 900 million devices were vulnerable to the flaws, which were presented by Check Point researchers at DEF CON in Las Vegas this summer. According to Check Point, the flaws could be exploited by an attacker using a malicious app. "Such an app would require no special permissions to take advantage of these vulnerabilities, alleviating any suspicion users may have when installing." Dell finally swallowed EMC in the final chapter of the $60 billion deal that included the acquisition of RSA. RSA President Amit Yoran wrote in a blog post that the new ownership would not change RSA's mission, stating: "There will be no changes to our product strategies, sales models, customer support interactions, processes or resources that we are not driving." EMC bought RSA in 2006 for $2.1 billion. At the time, many questioned the wisdom of EMC's purchase of RSA. Next Steps Find out more about using the Let's Encrypt open certificate authority.

The game is just over 60 days old—after first debuting on July 6—and is now the fastest game to have reached $500 million in revenue, despite a continued decline in both downloads and usage. “Now, after debuting in early July, Pokémon GO has surpassed $500 million in worldwide customer spending for Google Play and the iOS App Store,” reads the App Annie report. “This puts the game solidly on track to hit $1 billion in revenue by the end of 2016, as we predicted the month of its launch.” That $500 million may sound like a lot of money (okay, it is a lot of money), but it gets split among developer Niantic, the Pokémon Company and Nintendo, along with app-store owners Apple and Google.  Apple and Google take a 30 percent cut of all in-app purchases. Of what's left, the breakdown is a bit more convoluted, since both Nintendo and Google’s parent company Alphabet have ownership stakes in Niantic and Nintendo owns a third of the Pokémon Company. One early estimate put Nintendo's total take at no more than 10 percent.  This isn’t the first milestone for Pokémon Go, as the app was quick to set records from being the most downloaded app in the first week of an app release to the fastest app to reach 50 million installs on Google Play. The app’s ability to set records should come as no surprise since Niantic Labs found that Pokémon Go has been downloaded 500 million times around the globe. The App Annie report also found high retention rates by looking at Android users. “We looked at the top Android phone apps by monthly active users (MAU) in the US to see which games had the top 30-day retention rates,” reads the report. “While Pokémon GO is behind the highly addictive Words With Friends, it is ahead of mega-hits Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, and Candy Crush Saga.” Echoing these findings is engagement data from mobile app intelligence firm SensorTower, which found that Pokémon Go players spent an average of 32 minutes on the game in August, down only slightly from 33 minutes back during the game's July peak. Time spent on the game is higher than that on popular social media platforms (users spend an average of 22 minutes on the Facebook app, 18 minutes on Snapchat and 17 minutes on the Twitter app) but lower than other games like Game of War and Candy Crush Saga—users spend an average of two hours a day on the former and 43 minutes on the latter. In fact, reaching the $500 million mark in such a short time is a significant accomplishment when taking into consideration how much time players spend on games like Candy Crush and how long it took the mobile game to making $500 million in revenue—200 days. Games like Clash of Clans and Puzzle & Dragons took over 400 days.

Photo: App Annie The game's journey to the one billion mark may be slower, as its growth rate is slowing down. In the U.S. Google Play store, the Pokémon Go app went from number one to tenth place while the app has fallen to 36th place in the U.S. iOS store, according to App Annie data. That's not to say the app is losing popularity overall—it still ranks as one of the top games—but its growth, measured in daily downloads, has slowed. The number of Daily Active Users is also down from a July peak of over 40 million, hitting about 30 million in late August, according to research firm Apptopia.  Pokémon Go has generated over $500 million in revenue and is anticipated to make a billion by the year-red, according to a new report. Photo: App Annie App Annie points out that iOS and Android in-app purchases are not the game’s sole source of revenue. “In addition to McDonald’s Japan, SoftBank announced a partnership with Niantic at the start of September,” writes App Annie. “Under this alliance, the company’s 3,700 stores will be categorized as either PokéStops or gyms.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Smartphone apps now account for half the time Americans spend online Posted Sep 2, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Molotov raises $4.5 million from Sky as part of a bigger round Here’s a stat that’s sure to worry Google: smartphone applications now account for half the time that U.S. users spend online, up from 41 percent back in July 2014, according to a new report from comScore. And when you add tablet applications into the mix, that figure rises to nearly 60 percent. The new milestone was achieved this July, the report says, and is a testament to our increasing reliance on native mobile applications to deliver us the information we need, as well as the entertainment and distractions we crave – things we used to turn to the web for, in previous years. This shift towards apps is exactly why Google has been working to integrate the “web of apps” into its search engine, and to make surfacing the information hidden in apps something its Google Search app is capable of handling.  Our app usage has grown not only because of the ubiquity of smartphones, but also other factors – like faster speeds provided by 4G LTE networks, and smartphones with larger screens that make sitting at a desktop less of a necessity. In addition, the app stores have grown to house millions of downloads – so there really is an app for just about anything you need. In terms of which apps are most popular, a prior comScore report offers some insight. The list of top apps by unique visitors is dominated today by the big players, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Pandora, Snapchat and newcomer Pokémon Go. The apps with the most usage, in order, are: Facebook, Messenger, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Search, Google Play, Gmail, Pandora, Instagram, Amazon mobile, Apple Music, Apple Maps, Pokémon Go, Snapchat, and Pinterest. What’s surprising about this list is Pokémon’s ranking – something that proves there’s still room for new apps to become giants in what’s now a saturated market. ComScore says that, for as long as it has been measuring digital audiences, there isn’t even a remotely comparable instance of a website or app capturing as large an audience as Pokémon Go did in such a short time. The closest example was Walmart’s app when it debuted its Savings Catcher, which grew by 4 million users to 24 million over the course of 4 months. Pokémon Go, however, became the 13th largest mobile app with 55 million unique users (U.S.) across smartphones and tablets in its first month – or more than 30 percent of the total mobile population. It also ranked 4th in total time spent in app, behind Facebook, Pandora and YouTube. Over a third of its users visited the app daily, too. The latest report from Sensor Tower indicates that Pokémon Go has now surpassed 180 million downloads worldwide, and the average U.S. iOS user is playing the game for 32 minutes per day. It’s also raking in over $4 million in net revenue daily. While Pokémon may be more the exception than the rule, consumers’ app usage has been steadily climbing over the years. This figure grew from 34 percent in 2013, to 41 percent the following year and has now reached 50 percent. In the near-term, comScore expects apps to grow beyond the 50 percent mark as well, but says that both desktops and tablets will continue to maintain critical roles in consumers’ lives for the foreseeable future.

This is root. (AP Images/ Peter Zschunke) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Machines with Brains September 09, 2016 If you want to talk about something important or sensitive, odds are that conversation will happen over the phone rather than email or text. The sound of someone’s voice is an important part of trusting them—but the ability to trust the voice on the other end of that call is human might change. Google DeepMind announced a new speech generation method it calls WaveNet, which could bring artificial intelligence closer than ever to indiscernibly mimicking human speech. The algorithm can easily learn different voices and even generates artificial breaths, according to a DeepMind blog post. DeepMind, the London-based AI firm acquired by Google in 2014, broadly works to “solve intelligence,” a goal that spans health, data center energy efficiency, and ancient Chinese board games. Building audio from scratch is difficult because the data is so dense. Each second of digitally recorded speech (at the quality of a typical phone call) is made of 16,000 different bits of data, called samples. It takes a lot of power to recreate information that granular. Google’s current method of doing this uses AI, but it’s generated in a chunkier way. Imagine you want to make a cup. You can build it with Legos, or use clay. In the Legos scenario, each building block rests on each other to make a complete structure, but each was distinctly created. That’s like Google’s method now, which uses recurrent neural networks. You can listen to that here: https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/pixie/us-english/parametric-1.wav WaveNet works more like the clay. It’s rolled into a long string and coiled, every part existing in the context of what comes before it. This approach uses convolutional neural networks, where previously generated data is considered when producing the next bit of information. By taking advantage of this continuous generation, DeepMind was able to cut the gap between quality of human and machine generation speech by 50% in blind tests. Listen to WaveNet say the same thing here: https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/pixie/us-english/wavenet-1.wav For WaveNet to understand what human speech sounds like, it first had to listen. DeepMind researchers fed the algorithm 44 hours of speech, by 109 different English speakers. Results showed that after learning from that wide range of different speakers, the algorithm could model any single speaker that it learned from.

The para-cyclist, who had already claimed bronze at the past two winter Paralympics in the slalom, won her third in the women’s B3 1km time trial on day two of competition in Rio. “I still can’t believe it. It seems like a long time coming after being banned from Beijing for not being blind enough,” she said. The Melbourne-based rider, who has a vision impairment, was selected for the 2008 Beijing Summer Games but was declared ineligible on the eve of competition, as her right eye was deemed 0.1 of a degree too sighted to legally compete. “It was so bizarre and just completely ironic. At the time it was just complete devastation,” she said.

Tweet SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     AFP September 10, 2016, 12:26 am TWN SAN FRANCISCO -- Google on Thursday announced a deal to pay US$625 million for Apigee, a firm specializing in managing the application programming interfaces, or APIs, that businesses use to connect with customers online. <a href="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=537134883&cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Google senior vice president Diane Greene said in a blog post about the acquisition. For example, APIs can enable a business's computer networks to communicate with apps on smartphones or tablets. Apigee is used by hundreds of companies, including AT&T, Bechtel, Burberry, Live Nation and Walgreens, according to Google. Adding Apigee to its team promises to raise Google's game against major competitors Amazon and Microsoft in the market to provide businesses with services in the internet cloud. Forrester, the independent market-research company, last year predicted that annual global spending on API management would top US$1 billion by 2020. The acquisition is subject to approval by regulators and Apigee shareholders but is expected to be completed this year.

Wi-Fi Assistant allows users to automatically connect to public Wi-Fi networks which Google has determined are fast and secure, even adding a layer of security through a VPN. Now that functionality is rolling out to all Nexus devices, Project Fi or not, in North America and Europe. To access this feature on your device you will need to be running Android 5.1 Lollipop or higher and will need to update the Google Connectivity Services application. Once you’ve done that, head into your settings app, find the Google section, and look for the Networking option. Once there, you should see an option to enable Wi-Fi Assistant if a popup notification doesn’t show up first. After you’ve turned the feature on, it will automatically connect to public Wi-Fi networks automatically. For the feature to connect to a public network, it will require that network to be completely open, meaning no password to connect and no password or confirmation to sign on. The latest update to Google Connectivity Services, version D.1.5.10, is available now on Google Play. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

Users with the old UI will get a quick notification in Hangouts giving them the option to quickly update to the new version of the extension. This new extension works exactly like the app, regardless of platform, and brings all of your conversations into a single window for easy access. It runs in your taskbar just like the app does, but no longer can you have several conversations docked to the bottom of your display. The new experience isn’t bad by any means at all, but it’s certainly not great for interacting with several different conversations at once. If you do want to separate windows, you can pop out individual conversations into their own windows to keep things spread out, although you can’t keep those docked to the bottom of the display. For me personally, this new UI isn’t a big deal on Windows, but on Chrome OS it’s quite disappointing seeing how well the extension integrated into the OS. Interestingly enough, Google still has the Hangouts app available for download on the Chrome Web Store. I guess Google just can’t bear to lose one of its messaging apps… Guides Chrome/OS View THe Guide Google Hangouts View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Comment Following extensive coverage of Google’s capture of government policy making and its agencies, a Google-funded group has responded with a surreal report into “regulatory capture” – allegedly by people Google wishes weren’t there. Unfortunately, the report from the activist groupuscule Public Knowledge (PK) – one of a number of synthetic astroturf non-governmental organizations that take Silicon Valley’s position on telecom and media issues – not only makes PK look very petty indeed, but highlights a democratic deficit in big-money politics. Namely, that if you want to change a law or policy, do it democratically, upfront, and with a popular mandate. Public Knowledge fumes that the US Copyright Office (USCO) is doing its statutory job, which includes ensuring that the copyright system works. PK thinks (and here you must cover the children’s ears) the Copyright Office is “furthering the interests of rightsholders.” Almost every sentient American who has posted an image to Facebook or Twitter is a rightsholder, even if they don’t assert it. Silicon Valley’s great trick is that digital property rights are something that only belong to other people – bad people – thus persuading Americans not to assert their own rights – an inconvenience to the vast corporations that make money from ordinary people’s work. In the report, PK provides us with the useful insight that copyright industries take a greater role in making representations to the USCO than non-copyright industries, which “will not have anywhere near the same incentives as the entertainment industries to maximize their influence.” In other words, industries that require property law to work are more interested in making it work properly than industries that don’t. No shit, Sherlock. The activist group is equally angry that the USCO has inexplicably decided not to weaken or abolish copyright altogether. But it’s actually the job of the USCO to ensure that copyright works – and Congress’ job to strengthen it, weaken it, or abolish the law. To PK, the failure to weaken copyright is a sure sign of a conspiracy. And in a surreal twist, while PK accuses the Copyright Office of furthering a sinister and wide-ranging conspiracy to uphold US property laws, it also says that... nobody listens to the USCO. It “has its views ignored or outright rejected by courts, Congress, and other agencies.” In other words, the Copyright Office’s food is terrible – and even worse, comes in such small portions. What evidence PK has assembled is of a dozen staff moving between the public sector (the USCO) and the private sector over the past eight years. It’s a surprisingly small number, and dwarfed by the hundreds of staff who have shuttled between Google, the White House, and regulatory agencies. It might have been wiser of a Google-funded group not to go there. But it couldn’t help itself, it seems, so like the Light Brigade, charged right in. For tin-foil hatters, it’s here [PDF]. Make sure you have a jar of dead insects handy as you savour it. And isn’t the problem with the world not that you have surrendered control over your photos and words to huge Silicon Valley corporations, but that copyright terms are so long? That could be your first observation. Far too long. ® Bootnote Of course, we can have an internet that allows information to flow freely, but that respects the individual’s property rights. The entire purpose of the propaganda exercise is to persuade us we can have one (the internet) or the other (property rights) – but not both.

And you absolutely should do that — it’s always better to be safe than sorry. But before rushing to it, you’ll probably want to back your phone up. Whether you’re moving on to another device or looking to get another Galaxy Note 7 once they have resolved its issues, be sure to take the time to make sure your data is saved for easy transfer to whichever device you’re moving to. Let’s look into your options. Before you do anything No matter how you may choose to back your phone up, it’s important to first contact your carrier to make sure you understand their exchange process. Some carriers may ask for the original device before giving you a replacement. Some will give you a loan device. Some will ship you a device before you have to send yours back. And some will require you to head in-store to carry-out the exchange. Figure out what your carrier does so you can know exactly how to proceed with your backup needs and best determine which of the following methods is right for you. Moving from one Galaxy Note 7 to another If you’re looking to go with another Samsung Galaxy Note 7, there’s a fantastic option waiting for you known as Samsung Cloud. This feature was introduced with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 as the premier cloud backup option for Samsung users. You’ll get 15GB of space to backup photos and video, contacts, notes, apps, app settings, voice recordings, calendar and contact entries and more. Better yet, Samsung lets you backup your bookmarks, call log, app data, home screen layout, device settings, and email accounts. Once you have backed up all elements you want, you can sign into your new Samsung Galaxy Note 7 to restore the phone using the backup. The result will be a near-100% representation of your old device. All your files, videos, photos, music, contacts, and more are right where you left them. Your home screen is exactly like it was on your old phone. Settings are copied, too. Your only setup is to log in and press a few buttons. Note that these steps require you to be signed in using your Samsung account. If you don’t already have one, head to Samsung’s Galaxy Apps or the accounts section in the Settings menu to create one. Backing up your entire Galaxy Note 7 using Samsung Cloud Backing up your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is really easy. Here’s how you go about doing it: Go to Settings > Cloud and accounts > Samsung Cloud > Back up my data. Select all of the types of data you want backed up by flipping their respective toggles. Once ready, select the “Back up now” option at the bottom of the screen. Once finished, your data will be backed up to the cloud, and it should be safe for you to return the device. Restoring your Galaxy Note 7 using Samsung Cloud When you’re ready to restore your data on the new device, follow these steps: Go to Settings > Cloud and accounts > Samsung Cloud > Restore. Be sure to select the latest backup you’ve created. It’ll be named something like “Note 7: 9/9/2016”. Here, you can choose to restore some or all elements of your phone, such as call data, apps, and homescreen layout. Select what you want restored to your phone. Press the Restore Now button. The process will complete after some time, and you’ll be ready to go on with your day. Verizon and AT&T users As it relates to Samsung Cloud, here’s a quick warning: Verizon has completely removed the app in favor of their own backup solution. There are workarounds — such as using ADW Launcher to create a shortcut to Samsung Cloud’s activity — but if you aren’t comfortable doing that then you’ll want to explore other options ahead. We should note that this also seems to be true for some AT&T Galaxy Note 7 users and not others. To check if you have Samsung Cloud, head to Settings > Cloud and Accounts > Samsung Cloud. Moving from the Galaxy Note 7 to another Android or Samsung phone Unfortunately, Samsung Cloud is not yet available for all Samsung phones. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge will soon get it in a software upgrade, and Samsung’s 2015 flagships will also get it at some point. If the device you’re moving to has Samsung Cloud then we suggest going that route. But if you’re moving to another Samsung phone or a version of the Galaxy Note 7 without Samsung Cloud, or pretty much any other Android phone, you’ll need a couple of things. We feel the combination of Google’s backup option and third-party cloud backup services of your choice is the best route to go. We like all of Google’s options in that regard, so we’ll be focusing on their apps. Be sure to alter any of these steps for your app of choice if you have different preferences. Note: If you’re moving to iOS, then your best option is to use the Move to iOS app Apple has created. The app will transfer message history, contacts, photos and video, bookmarks, email accounts, and calendar entries to your iPhone. For other data, back them up to your computer or use cloud services to transfer them. Backing up your Apps and Google account Using Google’s option, you’ll be able to backup data from apps, Calendar, Chrome, Contacts, Google Drive, Gmail, Google Fit, Google Play Movies, TV and Music, People details, and Google Photos. Restoring your phone from your Google account will re-download the apps you had installed at the time of backup, as well as restoring the app data that was stored in the backup. On your Samsung Galaxy Note 7, you’ll want to follow these steps to ensure your data is syncing: Go to Settings > Personal > Backup & reset. Make sure “Backup my data” is enabled. Also ensure “Automatic restore” is enabled. As for app data syncing: Go to Settings > Data usage Tap the overflow menu (the three-dot menu symbol) at the upper-right of the screen. Make sure “Auto-sync data” is turned on. Backing up your photos and video using Google Photos With the advent of Google Photos, it is ridiculously easy to backup photos and videos in their original quality to Google’s secure cloud servers. These photos will be made available on any device you have Google Photos installed, and they can be downloaded to your local storage whenever you want them. Or you can keep them in the cloud indefinitely and manage them through Google Photos. In case you need help, be sure to check out our previous article showing you how to backup your photos and video using Google Photos. Backing up documents and other files using Google Drive Unfortunately, Google Photos won’t backup anything other than photos and video, but Google Drive will. You can upload almost anything to Google Drive as long as you have enough space. Go through your phone and find the files you want (you can use Samsung’s My Files app to easily traverse your phone’s storage), and use the Share feature to upload them directly to Google Drive. This may take some time to complete, so grab a drink and let it do its thing. Backing up local music tracks to Google Play Music We have a separate section for your local music files because Google Play Music is one of the best places for it (aside from dumping it to a microSD card, which the Galaxy Note 7 now supports). While there are still valid reasons for backing music up to Google Drive — such as being able to upload your playlist files — Google Play Music gives you space to store 50,000 tracks, all of which can be played back from the cloud and managed in a neat user interface. The only way to upload tracks directly from your phone is to first upload them to Google Drive and then sync your Google Drive account to Google Play Music. This method isn’t ideal, however, as large music libraries may eat up a significant portion of your storage limits. To upload your tracks directly to Google Play Music, you will need a desktop PC or Mac that can use the Google Play Music Manager app. Head here for instructions on installing it. Once installed, it’s really easy to get your tracks uploaded: Transfer the music files from your phone to a designated folder on your computer. Select the Music Manager icon . You’ll find this at the bottom right of your screen (Windows) or the menu bar in the upper right corner (Mac). Select Preferences In the “Upload” tab, click Add folder to browse and select a folder you would like to upload music from. Click Upload. Alternatively, you can install Google Play Music for Google Chrome and drag/drop audio files to upload them directly to Google Play Music. When you’re on your new phone, simply download Google Play Music and sign in to access all your music. Because your tracks will have already been transferred to your PC, you can consider that the primary location of your local copies and transfer them back to your new device’s storage, or simply reinsert the microSD card into your new phone if you prefer local copies to be on your phone. If your new phone doesn’t have a microSD slot, you’ll need to transfer your files to its internal storage using a USB cable. When you’re on your new phone The initial setup wizard will prompt you to restore a backup from your Google account. It’ll show you all of the apps and data that will be restored. Confirm the list of stuff you want restored and commence with it. Once finished, you should have all your apps — including the ones we’ve discussed above — installed and immediately ready to use. Most apps’ data should be restored, so their unique data should be waiting for you on the new phone. Your photos will be in Google Photos and you’ll be able to download local copies, if you wish. Google Play Music tracks will be ready in the cloud and available for offline listening if you choose (or, as we discussed before, simply reinsert your microSD card or transfer over USB from your PC to your internal storage). Calendar, Contacts, email, and more should all flow in like normal, too. Enjoy your new device Whether you’re waiting on a replacement or moving on from the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, these steps should make your transition much easier than having to start from the ground up. No matter what backup tool you use or which route you go, it’s important to be thorough in making sure all your data is easily retrievable and restorable. Do research on your tools to make sure you have enough trust in them to handle your data the way they’re supposed to. Above all, be careful about where you’re putting stuff so you don’t wind up wiping precious memories and sensitive files away forever. local_offer    Resources   Samsung   Samsung Cloud   Samsung Galaxy Note 7   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (5) stars Further Reading Get a 64GB Samsung MicroSD for only $22 Galaxy Tab S3 coming early 2017?

Six months after announcing support for Apple's Live Photos, Google Photos for iOS is adding image stabilization to the GIF-like feature. Using the same technology that allows Motion Stills to turn Live Photos into looping clips, the updated app freezes the Live Photo background to erase bumps and shakes. "Now, with the latest Google Photos update on iOS, you can make your Live Photos smoother and more shareable in just a tap," the team wrote in a Google+ post. Apple introduced Live Photos in September 2015 as one of the standout features of its iPhone 6s and 6s Plus handsets. Whenever you take a picture with the function enabled, your smartphone also captures a three-second video surrounding the time said photo was snapped. But the moving images are not easily transferred to non-iOS devices. So, as VentureBeat reports, Google now lets users save Live Photos as .MOV videos, which can be posted to social media and emailed or texted to friends. //Related Articles 17 Tricks to Master Google Photos This update also includes the ability to sort photos in albums chronologically or by recently added. And, based on user feedback, you can now choose a new thumbnail for faces in People. "Fear not—this is also live on [the] Web and [is] coming soon to Android," the Google Photos team said. Similarly, Facebook is testing a hybrid algorithm designed to add a bit of stability to shaky 360-degree videos, in hopes of improving the experience for all users—specifically, those making and watching the clips.

Google’s Clever Plan to Stop Aspiring ISIS Recruits Wired 9/7/2016 Andy Greenberg Google has built a half-trillion-dollar business out of divining what people want based on a few words they type into a search field. In the process, it’s stumbled on a powerful tool for getting inside the minds of some of the least understood and most dangerous people on the Internet: potential ISIS recruits. Now one subsidiary of Google is trying not just to understand those would-be jihadis’ intentions, but to change them. Popular Searches Lowe's Companies Inc LOW ▼ 67.13 -1.92 -2.78% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 744.96 +1.72 +0.23% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▼ 31.55 -0.16 -0.49% Target Corp TGT ▲ 76.05 +4.61 +6.45% Jigsaw, the Google-owned tech incubator and think tank—until recently known as Google Ideas—has been working over the past year to develop a new program it hopes can use a combination of Google’s search advertising algorithms and YouTube’s video platform to target aspiring ISIS recruits and ultimately dissuade them from joining the group’s cult of apocalyptic violence. The program, which Jigsaw calls the Redirect Method and plans to launch in a new phase this month, places advertising alongside results for any keywords and phrases that Jigsaw has determined people attracted to ISIS commonly search for. Those ads link to Arabic- and English-language YouTube channels that pull together preexisting videos Jigsaw believes can effectively undo ISIS’s brainwashing—clips like testimonials from former extremists, imams denouncing ISIS’s corruption of Islam, and surreptitiously filmed clips inside the group’s dysfunctional caliphate in Northern Syria and Iraq.© Jigsaw Yasmin Green, Jigsaw’s head of research and development, who's leading its anti-ISIS search advertising campaign. “This came out of an observation that there’s a lot of online demand for ISIS material, but there are also a lot of credible organic voices online debunking their narratives,” says Yasmin Green, Jigsaw’s head of research and development. “The Redirect Method is at its heart a targeted advertising campaign: Let’s take these individuals who are vulnerable to ISIS’ recruitment messaging and instead show them information that refutes it.” The results, in a pilot project Jigsaw ran early this year, were surprisingly effective: Over the course of about two months, more than 300,000 people were drawn to the anti-ISIS YouTube channels. Searchers actually clicked on Jigsaw’s three or four times more often than a typical ad campaign. Those who clicked spent more than twice as long viewing the most effective playlists than the best estimates of how long people view YouTube as a whole. And this month, along with the London-based startup Moonshot Countering Violent Extremism and the US-based Gen Next Foundation, Jigsaw plans to relaunch the program in a second phase that will focus its method on North American extremists, applying the method to both potential ISIS recruits and violent white supremacists. An Antidote to Extremism’s Infection While tech firms have been struggling for years to find countermeasures to extremist content, ISIS’ digital propaganda machine has set a new standard for aggressive online recruitment. Twitter has banned hundreds of thousands of accounts only to see them arise again—many migrating to the more private service Telegram—while other services like YouTube and Facebook have fought an endless war of content removal to keep the group’s vile beheading and immolation videos offline. But attempts to intercept the disaffected young Muslims attracted to that propaganda and offer them a counternarrative—actual protection against the group’s siren song—have mostly amounted to public service announcements. Those PSA series have included the U.S. State Department’s campaign called Think Again, Turn Away and the blunt messaging of the cartoon series Average Mohammed. Those campaigns are likely only effective for dissuading the audience least indoctrinated by ISIS’s messages, argues Green, who’s interviewed jailed ISIS recruits in Britain and defectors in an Iraqi prison. “Further down the funnel are the people who are sympathetic, maybe ideologically committed, maybe even already in the caliphate,” says Green. “That’s Jigsaw’s focus.” To capture the people already drawn into ISIS’ orbit, Jigsaw took a less direct approach. Rather than create anti-ISIS messages, the team curates them from YouTube. “We thought, what if the content exists already?” says Green. “We knew if it wasn’t created explicitly for this purpose, it would be more authentic and therefore more compelling.” Testing the Theory Jigsaw and two partners on the pilot project, Moonshot CVE and the Lebanese firm Quantum Communications, assembled two playlists of videos they found in both Arabic and English, ranging from moderate Muslim clerics pointing out ISIS’s hypocrisy to footage of long food lines in the ISIS’s Syrian stronghold Raqqa. Jigsaw chose more than 1,700 keywords that triggered ads leading to their anti-ISIS playlists. Green and her team focused on terms they believed the most committed ISIS recruits would search for: names of waypoints on travel routes to ISIS territory, phrases like “Fatwa [edict] for jihad in Syria” and names of extremist leaders who had preached ISIS recruitment. The actual text of the search ads, however, took a light-touch approach, with phrases like “Is ISIS Legitimate?” or “Want to Join ISIS?” rather than explicit anti-ISIS messages. Measuring the actual effects of the campaign in dissuading ISIS recruits isn’t easy. But Jigsaw and its partners found that they at least captured searchers’ attention. The clickthrough rates on some of the ads were more than 9 percent, they say, compared with averages around 2 or 3 percent in the average Google keyword advertising campaign. They also discovered that the hundreds of thousands of searchers spent a total of half a million minutes watching the videos they collected, with the most effective videos getting as much as 8 minutes and 20 seconds average viewing time. But Could It Work? Jigsaw’s program is far from a comprehensive solution to ISIS’s online recruitment, says Humera Khan, the executive director of the Islamic deradicalization group Muflehun. She points out that both Google and Facebook have trained anti-extremism non-profits in the past on how to use their keyword advertising, though perhaps without the deep involvement in targeting, curating and promoting video Jigsaw is trying. More importantly, she argues, attracting ISIS sympathizers to a video playlist is only the first step. “If they can hook people in, can they keep them coming back with new and relevant content? That’ll be important,” says Khan. Eventually, any successful deradicalization effort also needs human interaction, too, and a supportive community backing up the person’s decision to turn away from extremism. “This sounds like a good piece of the solution. But it’s not all of it.” From a national security perspective, Jigsaw’s work raises another glaring question: Why not target would-be ISIS recruits for surveillance and even arrest instead? After all, intercepting ISIS sympathizers could not only rescue those recruits themselves, but the future victims of their violence in terrorist attacks or genocidal massacres in ISIS’s bloody sphere of influence. On that question, Jigsaw’s Green answers carefully that “social media platforms including YouTube have a responsibility to cooperate [with] the governments’ lawful requests, and there are processes in place to do that.” Translation? Google likely already helps get some of these people arrested. The company, after all, handed over some data in 64 percent of the more than 40,000 government requests for its users’ data in the second half of last year. But Green says that the Redirect Method, beyond guiding ISIS admirers to its videos, doesn’t seek to track them further or identify them, and isn’t designed to lead to arrests or surveillance, so much as education. “These are people making decisions based on partial, bad information,” says Green. “We can affect the problem of foreign fighters joining the Islamic State by arming individuals with more and better information.” She describes the campaign’s work as a kind of extension of Google’s core mission “to make the world’s information accessible and useful.” Perhaps one of world’s most dangerous problems of ignorance and indoctrination can be solved in part by doing what Google does best: Helping people find what they most need to see.

Photo: Reuters A team at Google parent Alphabet Inc working on unmanned aerial systems this month will try delivering burritos by drone on a college campus in Virginia. Astro Teller, playfully referred to as the “Captain of Moonshots” at an X lab created at Google to pursue big-vision projects such as drones and self-driving cars, said in a blog post that Project Wing team was ready to launch the test of a prototype drone delivery system. US officials announced last month that Alphabet is joining tests for drone deliveries, as the White House unveiled accelerated rule-making for commercial unmanned aircraft operations. Teller said that a Wing prototype is ready for testing and that the team will run hundreds of flights in Virginia over the course of several days to deliver lunches prepared in an on-site food truck by Mexican food chain Chipotle. “We want to learn how people feel when they’re receiving a package by air, and taking someone’s time and/or money changes things more than a little,” Teller said. “And we want to feel the pressure of unexpected circumstances that show us how we can get better at loading and managing a fleet of planes,” he said. The Project Wing team opted to try out delivering food to create operating challenges including “a lunchtime rush of burrito orders” as well as having to get food to customers hot and in the right shape, according to Teller. “In future tests, we could add a broader range of items, like drinks, which will push us to handle more weight, keep packages carefully balanced, and manage combinations of items on a single flight,” he added. He believes drones will be available within the next decade for important missions such as delivering medicine and other supplies to areas cut off by disasters and helping emergency responders battle wildfires. At a “White House Drone Day” event last month, officials announced steps toward expanding rules for drone operations, including for news gathering and commercial flights over populated areas, after a first set of regulations unveiled in June. “We hope to propose a rule on unmanned aircraft operations over people by the end of this year,” US Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Huerta said. Separately, Google on Thursday announced a deal to pay US$625 million for Apigee, a firm specializing in managing the application programming interfaces, or APIs, that businesses use to connect with customers online. APIs “are vital for how business gets done today in the fast-growing digital and mobile marketplace,” Google senior vice president Diane Greene said in a blog post about the acquisition. “They’re the hubs through which companies, partners and customers interact, whether it’s a small business applying online for a loan or a point-of-sale system sending your warranty information to the manufacturer,” she added. For example, APIs can enable a business’s computer networks to communicate with apps on smartphones or tablets. This story has been viewed 1846 times. Comments will be moderated.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Internet Google rolls out new Reviews from the web feature in search Internet Google rolls out new Reviews from the web feature in search By Sohil Nikam - Google recently rolled out a critic reviews feature which allowed critiques from a few reputed websites to show up in search results. User-generated appraisals had no place in this system, with reviews from platforms like TripAdvisor and Yelp getting shunted for this very reason. This status quo lead to some heavy criticism against Google. It looks like the search giant has finally paid heed to the negative feedback by introducing a new ‘Reviews from the Web’ feature. The tool aggregates consumer reviews from up to three websites and adds them to its Knowledge Panels for local places. These critiques include areas of interest like shops, parks and restaurants. As for the sites themselves, they could be anything from a user ratings aggregator to a best-of places list generator. However, the portals would have to meet Google’s review snippet markup and other criteria to be eligible for inclusion. Also Read: Google vanquishes Quadrooter flaws in September Android security patch This essentially means that a person’s review on a platform such as Zomato might show up in Google Search results. As can be seen in the image above, seeking more information about a park will throw up assessments from websites like AllTrails, Facebook and Trekaroo. Even Google’s own reviews could find a place among the three featured. As for critics, they have their own critic review feature in local Knowledge Panels. Such content will be distinguished from user-produced ones by virtue of having an editorial tone of voice and an opinionated position on a local business. Furthermore, they’ll also be presented as a Rich Card. The Reviews from the Web tool is being rolled out right now all over the world and will available for both mobile and desktop.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Google Photos for iOS now lets you stabilize Live Photos Software Google Photos for iOS now lets you stabilize Live Photos By Bindu Nair - Google Photos for iOS has just gotten a massive update which introduces a new feature borrowed from the company’s Motion Stills application. The former can now steady Live Photos through advanced video stabilization technology. Live Photos basically records the few seconds before and after a photo is captured, outputting a short GIF-esque image. However, the results are usually unimpressive, marred by shakiness and blurriness. Moreover, they are a tad difficult to share with Android owners who don’t have an iPhone handy. Google Photos solves both these conundrums in its new update. The app is now claiming that its technology can even out Live Photos so they become more presentable and less shaky. Like Motion Stills, the application freezes the background into a still snap or creates sweeping cinematic pans. Also Read: Google rolls out new Reviews from the web feature in search The system more or less puts the focus into the center of the frame, allowing the Live Photo to be rendered into a smooth looping video rather than a rough collection of moments. This footage is saved to the iPhone’s camera roll and can additionally be shared with iOS and Android users alike. Other than making Live Photos better, Google Photos has also gotten the ability to sort pictures into albums chronologically or recently added, a feature which is already live on its web platform and will be making its way to Android soon. Users are also getting the power to choose a new thumbnail for faces in People. The updated Google Photos app is now available and can be downloaded from the App Store.

But since it was first unveiled in 2014, the team has been quietly toiling away in the shadows and is now looking to ramp things up, partnering with fast food chain Chipotle to deliver burritos to students at Virginia Tech in new trials starting this month. Project Wing emerged out of the semi-secretive Google X lab, the research arm behind some of the company's more audacious concepts such as a glucose-monitoring contact lens, internet-beaming balloons and a little something called Google Glass. The drone-delivery concept relies on fixed-wing aircraft that can take off vertically and lower packages to the ground on a retractable tether. When Project Wing first revealed the technology to the public, it demonstrated the autonomous drones delivering dog food, radios and chocolates at an Australian farm two years ago. It has since continued testing and refining the system on private land in California and is now turning its attention to Virginia Tech, a federally approved testing site where startup Flirtey is also putting its drones through their paces. This will be the first time Project Wing has used its drones to deliver items to external users in the US, though it's not going to be a frijole free-for-all. The trials will take place at a closed site, where participating students and employees will be able to place an order. The food will be prepared by Chipotle in a truck onsite and then delivered to the hungry customers by Project Wing's drones. "We want to learn how people feel when they're receiving a package by air, and taking someone's time and/or money changes things more than a little," writes Astro Teller, the X lab's so called Captain of Moonshots, in a blog post. "And we want to feel the pressure of unexpected circumstances that show us how we can get better at loading and managing a fleet of planes." The tests will allow researchers at Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership and Project Wing to study the vehicle performance and navigational capacity, while also gauging the human response to the idea of flying burritos. The resulting technical, safety and user-experience data will be shared with the Federal Aviation Administration, as it continues its efforts to integrate commercial drones into national airspace. The video below from earlier in the year shows Project Wing's drones in action.

QuickTake Artificial Intelligence U.K.-based DeepMind, which Google acquired for about 400 million pounds ($533 million) in 2014, developed an artificial intelligence called WaveNet that can mimic human speech by learning how to form the individual sound waves a human voice creates, it said in a blog post Friday. In blind tests for U.S. English and Mandarin Chinese, human listeners found WaveNet-generated speech sounded more natural than that created with any of Google’s existing text-to-speech programs, which are based on different technologies. WaveNet still underperformed recordings of actual human speech. Many computer-generated speech programs work by using a large data set of short recordings of a single human speaker and then combining these speech fragments to form new words. The result is intelligible and sounds human, if not completely natural. The drawback is that the sound of the voice cannot be easily modified. Other systems form the voice completely electronically, usually based on rules about how the certain letter-combinations are pronounced. These systems allow the sound of the voice to be manipulated easily, but they have tended to sound less natural than computer-generated speech based on recordings of human speakers, DeepMind said. WaveNet is a type of AI called a neural network that is designed to mimic how parts of the human brain function. Such networks need to be trained with large data sets. ‘Challenging Task’ WaveNet won’t have immediate commercial applications because the system requires too much computational power: it has to sample the audio signal it is being trained on 16,000 times per second or more, DeepMind said. And then for each of those samples it has to form a prediction about what the soundwave should look like based on each of the prior samples. Even the DeepMind researchers acknowledged in their blog post that this "is a clearly challenging task." Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

Speech is becoming an increasingly important way humans interact with everything from mobile phones to cars. Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Microsoft Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have all invested in personal digital assistants that primarily interact with users through speech. Mark Bennett, the international director of Google Play, which sells Android apps, told an Android developer conference in London last week that 20 percent of mobile searches using Google are made by voice, not written text. And while researchers have made great strides in getting computers to understand spoken language, their ability to talk back in ways that seem fully human has lagged. Strategy Game WaveNet is yet another coup for DeepMind, which is best known for creating AlphaGo, an AI system that beat the world’s top ranked human player in the strategy game Go this year. Still, Google has disclosed little about how DeepMind’s research has helped it commercially, although the company has revealed that it has used DeepMind’s technology to reduce the power demands of its data centers by 40 percent, saving enough money to justify the amount Google spent to buy the London AI company. It has also said that DeepMind has helped achieve “substantial improvements to a set of services from YouTube and Google Play to Google’s advertising products.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

It will be updated by Mozilla as more information becomes available. Please do not edit this page yourself; if you have proposed changes, email Gerv. The issues are in chronological order, and have been re-numbered from the original announcement to use letters with gaps in between, for possible future expansion. Contents 1 Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) 1.1 WoSign Response 1.2 Further Comments 2 Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) 2.1 WoSign Response 3 Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) 3.1 WoSign Response 3.2 Further Comments 4 Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) 4.1 WoSign Response 4.2 Further Comments 5 Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) 5.1 WoSign Response 5.2 Further Comments 6 Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) 6.1 WoSign Response 6.1.1 Bug N1 6.1.2 Bug N2 6.2 Further Comments 7 Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) 7.1 WoSign Response 7.2 Further Comments 8 Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) 8.1 WoSign Response 9 Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) 9.1 WoSign Response 10 Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) 10.1 WoSign Response 11 Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) 11.1 WoSign Response 11.2 Further Comments 12 Cross Signing Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers, across a handful of different serial numbers. Here is one example. This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. WoSign discovered the github misissuances due to a post-issuance review the following day, triggered by "github" being on their list of high-value domains. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which we believe violates section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. Furthermore, when this clause was brought to their attention, they denied that any changes fell under it, and they attempted to suppress further information about the ownership transfer when it was brought to the community's attention. Full details can be found in the post in mozilla.dev.security.policy. WoSign Response Richard Wang writes: "An announcement and disclosure will be made shortly pending completion of the business transaction. We can provide the proof documents to Mozilla to show this transaction is not finished if Mozilla think it is necessary." Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is probably 67, but may be a few more or less. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, around 12th May 2015, WoSign started using a new certificate template for some of their SHA-1 issuances. This has a fixed notAfter date of 2016-12-29T16:00:00Z (i.e. midnight on 29th/30th December, CST). This may have been a (sensible) move to prevent accidentally issuing SHA-1 certs which ran into 2017. We have found 939 SHA-1 certificates with this fixed notAfter date, including the above three. Certificates issued using this template almost exclusively have notBefore dates on working days in China, suggesting they are issued by explicit WoSign employee action. All of them have notBefores between Monday and Friday, except for 13 on a Saturday and 66 on a Sunday. Of those 66, 4 have notBefores on 2015-09-06, a Sunday which was, unusually, a working day in China. The other 62 all have notBefores on 2015-12-20, which was a Sunday, and not a working day in China. This suggests that, for these 62, the notBefore does not reflect the actual issuance date. For these 62, the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated, and this is cryptographically provable) but where the SCT date is nevertheless (just) before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating would not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, who are investigating the issue with Alibaba (owner of the domain in question). This issuance used website control validation, which WoSign has since stopped doing. We await their fuller response. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the intermediate/root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. A security investigator used the value "1", and acquired two certificates which had notBefore dates (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which were signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. Cert 1, Cert 2. The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48, released on 1st August 2016. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been.

But a lack of unification and vendor support has, in some cases, stalled its adoption in the enterprise. Initiatives like the Open Compute Project (OCP), however, have increased the interest in open source, as organizations push the concept in their data centers. Here are frequently asked questions that examine recent advances in open source technology, as well as the benefits and challenges of using these technologies in the data center. How does open source technology benefit data center admins? Open source technology can bridge the gap between common data center issues in various locations around the world -- a problem that occurs in one location is likely to occur in another. The sharing of specs and code, along with the flexibility to edit or manage that code based on the needs of specific users, allows administrators to fix problems based on similar situations in other data centers. With open source technology -- be it software, hardware or a cloud platform -- users can minimize the costly IT purchases and upgrades associated with proprietary offerings, and instead utilize code already available through open source sharing. This can also prevent vendor lock-in, as users can pick and choose the features or services they want, based on their needs. What are some of the latest open source projects from the OCP? Google and major telecom companies, such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications, are making waves in the OCP, an open source initiative that aims to push more efficient server and data center designs. When a primary driver to switch to open source is the financial aspect, spending money on the necessary support can create a dilemma. Google teamed up with Rackspace to develop Open Compute servers that will use IBM's Power9 CPU after its release in 2017. The move signifies Google's challenge of Intel's dominance in the CPU market. Google also released blueprints of its 48V server architecture, marking the first time that Google publicized designs through open means. The design focuses primarily on the power mechanisms that Google uses, shifting away from alternating current lines to an approach that reduces cooling requirements and boosts efficiency. In the telecom industry, AT&T and Verizon recently joined the OCP Telco Project with the goal of sharing information on data center hardware and networking. Adoption on a wider scale remains slow -- despite financial and oil exploration companies using the technology -- but cost considerations are pushing companies toward open source channels. What other open source data center initiatives are there besides the OCP? A new data center open standard has emerged that offers an alternative to some of the more complicated designs associated with the OCP. The Open19 project, launched by LinkedIn Corp., attempts to appeal to a wider base than the OCP, focusing on servers and related equipment in a 19-inch data center rack. Using multiple vendors is a way to avoid vendor lock-in -- a big appeal for Open19, as smaller organizations want to find open source opportunities. The project also looks to shrink shared hardware in the rack and remove power supply units in servers. LinkedIn hopes to push the standard into a wider base, while coexisting with the OCP as another option for data center standards across different-sized racks. VMware's new Project Photon -- a container-friendly platform to support cloud-native applications -- was also recently added to the open source mix. In conjunction with the new Photon OS, Project Photon aims to smooth the transition from server virtualization to managing cloud-native apps on an open source operating system. The move signifies a push from VMware toward container workloads, and could be a draw for developers. What's the biggest challenge data center admins face with open source technology? When deploying or running open source technology, the lack of professional support can leave IT scrambling. Even after combing through search engine results and discussion boards, admins still might not have an answer for an urgent question. Professional support is lacking with open source tools, and although some vendors offer support services, they often comes at a cost. When a primary driver to switch to open source is the financial aspect, spending money on the necessary support can create a dilemma. Some larger companies have the resources -- both from a financial and staffing standpoint -- to support open source hardware and software in the data center, but smaller organizations often struggle to do so. When will open source become more prominent in IT, and what's holding it back? Since Facebook launched the OCP in 2011, larger companies have made the shift toward open source adoption -- but smaller ones linger behind. There's no telling when, exactly, open source and OCP will be the go-to when it comes to data center hardware and software infrastructure, as problems with staffing and support still hamper movements for small-scale operations. However, the market for open source platforms such as OpenStack continues to grow. OpenStack revenues will exceed $2 billion by 2017, according to analyst firm 451 Research. Much of that growth will be in the service provider market, but OpenStack distributions and IT training services are projected to drive growth in the enterprise, as well. With over 600 companies in attendance at the 2016 OCP Summit, including Microsoft, Apple, Google and larger financial services firms, the momentum for open source products seems to be picking up steam at big-name companies. The leaders of the pack are making waves in the field, but adoption remains low in smaller data centers. In production-style deployments, OCP is still off in the future.

WaveNet, as the system is called, generates voices by sampling real human speech and directly modeling audio waveforms based on it, as well as its previously generated audio. In Google’s tests, both English and Mandarin Chinese listeners found WaveNet more realistic than other types of text-to-speech programs, although it was less convincing than actual human speech. If that weren’t enough, it can also play the piano rather well. Text-to-speech programs are increasingly important for computing, as people begin to rely on bots and AI personal assistants like Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Amazon’s Alexa, and the Google Assistant. If you ask Siri or Cortana a question, though, they’ll reply with actual recordings of a human voice, rearranged and combined in small pieces. This is called concatenative text to speech, and as one expert puts it, it’s a little like a ransom note. The results are often fairly realistic, but as Google writes, producing a new audio persona or tone of voice requires having an actor record every possible sound in a database. Here’s one phrase, created by Google. There’s no library of real human voices making the sounds The alternative is parametric text to speech — building a completely computer-generated voice, using coded rules based on grammar or mouth sounds. Parametric voices don’t need source material to produce words. But the results, at least in English, are often stilted and robotic. You can hear that here. Google’s system is still based on real voice input. But instead of chopping up recordings, it learns from them, then independently creates its own sounds in a variety of voices. The results are something like this. Actually, that’s not quite right. On its own, WaveNet only knows a language’s sounds, not its content. Fire it up, and it produces pleasing yet mysterious nonsense, complete with human-like pauses and breath sounds. For meaningful speech, Google shapes the results with linguistic rules and suggestions. But the system itself isn’t specifically tied to speech. It can learn, for example, from piano music, too. Granted, there's already plenty of generative music, and it’s not nearly as complicated as making speech that humans will recognize as their own. On a scale from 1 (not realistic) to 5 (very realistic), listeners in around 500 blind tests rated WaveNet at 4.21 in English and 4.08 in Mandarin. While even human speech didn’t get a perfect 5, it was still higher, at 4.55 in English and 4.21 in Mandarin. On the other hand, WaveNet outperformed other methods by a wide margin. WaveNet isn’t going to be showing up in something like Google Assistant right now — its step-by-step processing system requires a comparatively huge amount of computing power. But Google explains more about the system here, complete with more samples. For mathematical models and other details, there are also two papers posted online.

Comments InfoWorld | Sep 9, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Cloud Computing Application Development Open Source Google Docker Comments The tech world is increasingly awash in containers, and despite stiff competition, the industry seems to be settling on Kubernetes as the default container orchestration engine. Given the options, including Docker's own Swarm, it's worth looking at what makes Kubernetes so popular, especially given its comparative complexity. As with other popular open source software, such as MongoDB and Linux, the answer seems to come down to smart plays in community building -- and 15 years of Google R&D doesn't hurt. Ultimately, this unique blend of exceptional engineering and a willingness to let others take over make Kubernetes such an impressive open source project. [ Find out how to get ahead with our career development guide for developers. | The art of programming is changing rapidly. We help you navigate what's hot in programming and what's going cold. | Keep up with hot topics in programming with InfoWorld's Application Development newsletter. ] Make community real It shouldn't be this way. After all, Kubernetes is a mere two years old (as a public open source project), whereas Apache Mesos has clocked seven years in market. Docker Swarm is younger than Kubernetes, and it comes with the backing of the center of the container universe, Docker Inc. Yet the orchestration rivals pale in comparison to Kubernetes' community, which -- now under management by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation -- is exceptionally large and diverse. Kubernetes is one of the top projects on GitHub: in the top 0.01 percent in stars and No. 1 in terms of activity. While documentation is subpar, Kubernetes has a significant Slack and Stack Overflow community that steps in to answer questions and foster collaboration, with growth that dwarfs that of its rivals. More professionals list Kubernetes in their LinkedIn profile than any other comparable offering by a wide margin. Perhaps most glaring, data from OpenHub shows Apache Mesos dwindling since its initial release and Docker Swarm starting to slow. In terms of raw community contributions, Kubernetes is exploding, with 1,000-plus contributors and 34,000 commits -- more than four times those of nearest rival Mesos. What accounts for these wildly disparate community results? In a word: Google -- or rather, the relative lack of Google. While each of the other orchestration projects comes with a heavy dose of single-vendor influence, Kubernetes benefits from Google's hands-off approach to ongoing development, as well as its original engineering. Meanwhile, Docker, which owns the de facto container standard, has struggled to build a community as broad and deep as Kubernetes has. The reason, as Google's Kelsey Hightower points out, is Docker itself, which has blocked competitors from collaborating around a Docker standard. Docker, of course, doesn't need anyone's input on standardization, but it would appear the market favors less concentration of power at the orchestration layer of containers. Given its need to come up with a viable business model, we should expect Docker Inc. to compete hard to own ops and, hence, orchestration, for Docker containers. But unless the company can turn Swarm into a true industry effort, it's likely to win the container battle but lose the orchestration war, even if it could credibly claim better performance. Google wannabes Behind the community uptake of Kubernetes is exceptional technology. As Google's Borg technology, Kubernetes enjoyed more than 15 years of active development and heavy production. The technology was so good that Urs Holzle, then Google's head of technical infrastructure, reacted with disbelief when a few Google engineers suggested building a version of Borg and open sourcing it: So let me get this straight. You want to build an external version of the Borg task scheduler. One of our most important competitive advantages. The one we don't even talk about externally. And, on top of that, you want to open source it? Those engineers used Borg as a cluster management tool that powered the infrastructure behind Gmail, YouTube, Google Search, and other popular Google services. Later it was built into the Google Compute Engine, but the engineers noticed that customers were spinning up CPUs with terrible utilization rates. A container management system was needed, and they had one running behind the scenes. The trick was to get it out in the open. According to Google product manager Martin Buhr, Google's motivation behind Kubernetes comes down to noble intentions ... and enlightened self-interest. Google hopes an open source Kubernetes will dramatically scale developer productivity and thereby make the world a better place. More selfishly, "We think over time that our deep, comprehensive support for containers on Google Cloud Platform will create a gravity well in the market for container based apps and that a significant percentage of them will end up with us." In other words, let developers and operations teams get comfortable fiddling with Kubernetes so that they'll opt to let Google Cloud Platform make it easy to run. None of this works, however, if Google has a direct monetary interest in Kubernetes, which is something of a poison pill for open source communities. In a nutshell, Kubernetes is rocking because of the 15-plus years of Google R&D that goes into its code, but also because of Google's eagerness to encourage a community to take charge of the next 15-plus years of Kubernetes development.

Amazon’s recommendation engine uses personal data tracking combined with other users’ browsing habits to suggest relevant products. Google customises search results, and much more: for example, personalisation app Google Now seeks to “give you the information you need throughout your day, before you even ask”. Such personalisation systems don’t just aim to provide relevance to users; through targeted marketing strategies, they also generate profit for many free-to-use web services. Perhaps the best-known critique of this process is the “filter bubble” theory. Proposed by internet activist Eli Pariser, this theory suggests that personalisation can detrimentally affect web users’ experiences. Instead of being exposed to universal, diverse content, users are algorithmically delivered material that matches their pre-existing, self-affirming viewpoints. The filter bubble therefore poses a problem for democratic engagement: by restricting access to challenging and diverse points of view, users are unable to participate in collective and informed debate. Attempts to find evidence of the filter bubble have produced mixed results. Some studies have shown that personalisation can indeed lead to a “myopic” view of a topic; other studies have found that in different contexts, personalisation can actually help users discover common and diverse content. My research suggests that personalisation does not just affect how we see the world, but how we view ourselves. What’s more, the influence of personalisation on our identities may not be due to filter bubbles of consumption, but because in some instances online personalisation is not very “personal” at all. Data tracking and user pre-emption To understand this, it is useful to consider how online personalisation is achieved. Although personalisation systems track our individual web movements, they are not designed to “know” or identify us as individuals. Instead, these systems collate users’ real-time movements and habits into mass data sets, and look for patterns and correlations between users’ movements. The found patterns and correlations are then translated back into identity categories that we might recognise (such as age, gender, language and interests) and that we might fit into. By looking for mass patterns in order to deliver personally relevant content, personalisation is in fact based on a rather impersonal process. When the filter bubble theory first emerged in 2011, Pariser argued that one of the biggest problems with personalisation was that users did not know it was happening. Nowadays, despite objections to data tracking, many users are aware that they are being tracked in exchange for use of free services, and that this tracking is used for forms of personalisation. Far less clear, however, are the specifics of what is being personalised for us, how and when. Data gathering: less complex than we might think. Anton Balazh/Shutterstock Finding the ‘personal’ My research suggests that some users assume their experiences are being personalised to complex degrees. In an in-depth qualitative study of 36 web users, upon seeing advertising for weight loss products on Facebook some female users reported that they assumed that Facebook had profiled them as overweight or fitness-oriented. In fact, these weight loss ads were delivered generically to women aged 24-30. However, because users can be unaware of the impersonal nature of some personalisation systems, such targeted ads can have a detrimental impact on how these users view themselves: to put it crudely, they must be overweight, because Facebook tells them they are. It’s not just targeted advertising that can have this impact: in an ethnographic and longitudinal study conducted of a handful of 18 and 19-year-old Google Now users, I found that some participants assumed the app was capable of personalisation to an extraordinarily complex extent. Users reported that they believed Google Now showed them stocks information because Google knew their parents were stockholders, or that Google (wrongly) pre-empted a “commute” to “work” because participants had once lied about being over school age on their YouTube accounts. It goes without saying that this small-scale study does not represent the engagements of all Google Now users: but it does suggest that for these individuals, the predictive promises of Google Now were almost infallible. Are you an ideal user? EPA/DANIEL DEME In fact, critiques of user-centred design suggest that the reality of Google’s inferences is much more impersonal: Google Now assumes that its “ideal user” does – or at least should – have an interest in stocks, and that all users are workers who commute. Such critiques highlight that it is these assumptions which largely structure Google’s personalisation framework (for example through the app’s adherence to predefined “card” categories such as “Sports”, which during my study only allowed users to ‘follow’ men’s rather than women’s UK football clubs). However, rather than questioning the app’s assumptions, my study suggests that participants placed themselves outside the expected norm: they trusted Google to tell them what their personal experiences should look like. Though these might seem like extreme examples of impersonal algorithmic inference and user assumption, the fact that we cannot be sure what is being personalised, when or how are more common problems. To me, these user testimonies highlight that the tailoring of online content has implications beyond the fact that it might be detrimental for democracy. They suggest that unless we begin to understand that personalisation can at times operate via highly impersonal frameworks, we may be putting too much faith in personalisation to tell us how we should behave, and who we should be, rather than vice versa.

Borrowed from Google’s Motion Stills app which debuted in June 2016, this feature can freeze the background in your Live Photos or create sweeping cinematic pans. “Live Photos bring photos to life with sound and motion, but can suffer from the everyday bumps and shakes that happen when you take photos. Plus, they can be hard to share with friends who don’t have an iPhone,” writes Google. With the latest Google Photos update, shaky Live Photos should become a thing of the past. As mentioned, the app lets you make your Live Photos smoother and more shareable using stabilization techniques originally used in the Motion Stills app. You can save stabilized Live Photos as looping GIFs for frictionless sharing on social media. If you’re interested in how the stabilization algorithm works, check out a quick official explanation on Motion Stills on the official Google Research blog. By the way, this feature runs directly on the device, no Internet connection needed. Other improvements in this version of the app include the ability to select a thumbnail image for faces in the People album, sort photos in albums chronologically or by recently added (also available on the web and coming soon to Android), a simplified process of sharing to YouTube and performance improvements.

(Seeking Alpha) Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and its Google unit are aggressively pushing into the cloud, and investors should view this as a bullish sign for the stock. Deutsche Bank's Ross Sandler commented in a research note on Thursday that his recent channel checks show Google as not only "getting more aggressive" in the cloud space but "gaining traction" under the leadership of Diane Greene. Google has been heavily investing in its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and has committed to over $1 billion in acquisitions in the past year, including its recent acquisition of Apigee. As such, the narrative around GCP being a "distant third place" among major cloud providers "may start to improve" moving forward. Related Link: JPMorgan Shares Several Reasons VMware Is More Attractive Now Than A Year Ago Standing in Google's way of dominating the cloud space is the much larger Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), which operates cloud-computing service AWS, and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) — its Azure product is a similar cloud-computing platform. The Battle Begins Sandler further stated in his research report that his channel checks suggest Google is actively targeting "marquee" Silicon Valley customer prospects, many of whom currently use Amazon's AWS service. Google is also aggressively hiring sales reps who will place an emphasis on winning contracts based on its own products and infrastructure and not on price. In addition, the analyst is "also hearing" that GCP will make some "material product announcements" later this month. As such, Sandler stated that his prior $400 million revenue run-rate estimate for GCP in 2016 is too low and a better estimate could be closer to $750 million. "On its 2Q16 call, Google called out Cloud as the primary driver of the re-accelerating growth for Licensing and Other revenue, the first time the business has been called out in pole position," the analyst wrote. Related Link: Hewlett Packard Enterprises Spinoff Leaves Remaining Company On "Wrong Side Of The Cloud" Market Is Big Enough For All Sandler acknowledged that GCP is only a "small but growing" part of Google's business but it is also a segment with "potential upside surprise." Moreover, the cloud space has "ample room" for Google, Amazon and Microsoft to succeed in, so investors should remain long on all three names ahead of the "tidal wave of business flowing to the public cloud.

David Pierce Gear Date of Publication: 09.09.16. 09.09.16 Time of Publication: 6:53 am. 6:53 am How Chromebooks Are About to Totally Transform Laptop Design Google Google’s first Chromebook was the kind of laptop you’d design if you didn’t give a damn about laptop design. It was thick, heavy, rubbery, boring, and black. Black keys, black body, black trackpad, black everything. Everything about the Cr-48 was designed to communicate that this device was still an experiment. Even the name, a reference to an unstable isotope of the element Chromium, was a hint at the chaos raging inside this black box. “The hardware exists,” Sundar Pichai told a crowd of reporters at the Cr-48’s launch event in December of 2010, “only to test the software.” Moments later, Eric Schmidt took the stage and preached about how the “network computer” tech-heads had been predicting for decades was finally ready to change the world. “We finally have a product,” Schmidt said, “which is strong enough, technical enough, scalable enough, and fast enough that you can build actually powerful products on it.” Apparently already sensing the skeptical feedback Chrome OS would get, he gestured toward the audience and told them “it does, in fact, work.” For years, the knock on Chrome OS was that it was “just a browser.” A PC, people thought, had to be more than that. But now, almost six years since that first Chromebook, just a browser has turned out to be just enough for a growing group of users. Chromebooks outsold Macs for the first time in the first quarter of this year, and according to Google, US schools buy more Chromebooks than all other devices combined. The CR-48, Google’s first Chromebook.Google Even now, the Chrome OS revolution is only beginning. In the next few weeks, Chromebooks will suddenly have access to the millions of apps in Google’s Play Store, which will work on a Chrome OS device the way they work on Android phones. Also, Google’s beginning a big move into the boardroom, trying to convince businesses to use Chromebooks instead of their old Windows XP machines. And a whole new breed of Chromebooks is about to hit shelves. Not only are they high-end, they’re going to be completely different from the laptops we’ve known before. Getting Online Way back in 2006, Kan Liu started at Google working on Windows apps. Yep, Google used to make useful and popular Windows apps: a toolbar plugin for Internet Explorer, and a Desktop Search app that indexed your computer to make stuff easier to find. Even Liu thought the projects were weird. “If you thought about what Google was,” he tells me, “you’d be like wait, they make a download manager for native apps that you can download on Windows machine?” These apps were supposed to be fast, simple, and secure. But because Google couldn’t control Windows, it really couldn’t guarantee any of that. Boot times really drove them crazy. “Computers used to take, like, minutes to boot up,” says Caesar Sengupta, one of the original leaders of the Chromebook project. Tired of this unacceptable offense, a few people on the team started hacking around on an old netbook in the office, taking out whatever didn’t make sense—like the fact that Windows still checked for a floppy disk every time it turned on. Without even trying that hard, the team hacked together a Linux-based setup that went from off to online in ten seconds flat. Suddenly Google was in the OS business. More Chrome David Pierce Attention, College Students: Chromebooks Are About to Get Awesome David Pierce Review: HP Chromebook 13 Brian Barrett 4 Browsers That Might Break Your Chrome Addiction David Pierce Your Chromebook Will Soon Be Able to Run Android Apps Brian Barrett How to Set Up Your New Chromebook The projects that last within Google—the ones that aren’t Reader or Buzz or Wave or Currents—are the ones that scale. “If you want to do something at Google,” says Felix Lin, the VP in charge of all things Chromebook, “it really only makes sense to do it at Google if what you’re building can touch everybody in the world.” Lin came to Google with a singular mission: to build the company’s browser into an operating system that would make computing and computers accessible to more people. That meant making computers cheap enough so more people could buy them. More important, it meant removing settings, options, icons, buttons, and toolbars in an effort to make computers easy enough that anyone could use them. Particularly the billions of people who hadn’t used a computer before. When the first Chromebooks launched in 2010, anyone who’d ever used a PC decided something felt a little bit…off. “Among the many things you can’t do,” Laptop Magazine wrote, “is view the system properties to see exactly what hardware the computer has, so if you need to know how much free space is left on the system’s internal storage or what type of CPU you have, you’re out of luck. Nor can you control the power settings.” Notebook Review concluded its assessment with the phrase that still haunts Chrome OS: “So…it’s just a web browser?” Thinking about those early reviews makes Sengupta laugh. “The first people who bought Chromebooks were people who were computer folks,” he says. “They looked at the Chromebook and said, ‘This is not a real computer, it doesn’t have very many settings!'” They hated that you couldn’t find your files, or change the time setting. But why in the world, Sengupta argues, would any rational person want to manually change the time on their computer? It should just know. “The amount of work it took to eliminate all the settings,” he says, “so that you didn’t have to care and feed for your computer, was the thing that really made it successful.” The Chromebook Pixel, one of the Google-made Chrome OS devices.Josh Valcarcel/WIRED One place a super-simple, fiddle-free OS took off: schools. They loved that Chromebooks were cheap, easy to administer, and great for multi-user environments. Then it was businesses, which, well, same thing. Next, Chrome OS is out to convert everyone else. The Chrome OS team was a little early to the idea that people could do their work and live their lives inside a tab or six, but history has proven them right. That’s not to say the Chrome OS crew are fortune-tellers, of course. They did miss out on one very important thing: smartphones. You may have heard of them. “Back when we were starting Chrome OS,” Lin says, “the web and mobile were in a dead heat. We were betting big on the web, and the Android team was betting big on mobile.” He doesn’t say the obvious next part, which is that mobile and Android won. The Chrome OS team was right about a long of things, but it never saw mobile coming. There are still times when you want a keyboard and trackpad, though, or a screen larger than the palm of your hand. And lucky for the Chrome team, Android’s also part of Google. So the two teams started talking about how to integrate. They had lots of concerns about performance, integration, and above all security. A couple of years ago, a Chrome engineer ran an experiment: He took containers, a way of separating parts of a system that’s common in data centers, and ran them on a local machine. Android in one, Chrome OS is another. “A few of us saw it,” Sengupta says, “and our eyes literally opened up.” That was the answer. Android apps solve a couple of Chrome OS’s lingering problems. Most important, they bring all the software people are now accustomed to using, onto a new platform. Remember when people used to complain about Chromebooks not having Word? There are now billions of people who now reasonably expect their laptop to have Snapchat and Uber. Apps also offer offline support in a much more robust way, and they bring the kind of multi-window, desktop-app functionality that feels familiar to the old-school Windows users. Of course, they also require totally different things than traditional computer software. Most apps assume you’re using them on small, touch-enabled screens, running on devices with cellular connections and a bunch of sensors that you definitely don’t have in your laptop. So, OK, new question: what does a laptop look like in the age of mobile? New Puzzle Pieces Imagine you want to build a Chromebook. Great idea! Before you can do anything, you have to deal with Alberto Martin Perez, a product manager on the Chrome OS team. Perez is the keeper of Google’s documentation, the huge set of requirements and standards given to all Chromebook makers. The documentation is an ever-changing organism, concerned with everything from how much RAM and battery life a Chromebook needs, to how hard you have to press the trackpad before it registers as a click. If your Chromebook takes more than ten seconds to boot, or the power button isn’t on the top right? Get on the plane back to China and try again. The long, complex document is written in engineer-speak and is remarkably detailed. It’s Google’s first line of defense against corner-cutting manufacturers. When Google decided to integrate Android apps with Chrome OS, Perez and his team combed through the documentation. “We wanted to make sure we were ahead,” Perez says. “It’s really easy to change a web app, it’s really hard to change a laptop.” Google now strongly recommends—which is a lightly-veiled warning that it’ll be mandatory soon—that every Chromebook include GPS, NFC, compass, accelerometer, a fingerprint reader, and a barometer. Those are all smartphone parts that have made little sense in a laptop before. But Android apps are inspiring manufacturers to make devices that move, that adapt, that take on different forms in different contexts. The Acer Chromebook R13 is one the the first convertible Chromebooks. It won’t be the last.Google Computer industry execs believe Chrome OS has come into its own, that people will now choose it over Windows for reasons other than price. For many new customers, says Stacy Wolff, HP’s global head of design, “their first device was a smartphone. And they look for the cleanliness, the simplicity, the stability of what we see in those devices.” That’s the thinking behind the sharp and business-like HP Chromebook 13, the company’s new $500 laptop. Wolf sounds eager to continue down the fancy road, too: When I ask why the Chromebook 13’s not as nice as the Windows-powered Spectre 13, which is one of the best-looking and lightest laptops ever made, he pauses to make sure he’s not giving too much away. “I can’t talk about the future, but there’s nothing that stops us from continuing to go and revolutionize that space.” The $1,000 Chromebook used to be a silly sideshow, Google’s way of overshooting. Soon enough, it’ll be a totally viable purchase. The next few months are shaping up to be the PC market’s most experimental phase in a long time. The addition of Android apps “begs for higher performance hardware and new form factors to support these new use cases,” says Gary Ridling, Samsung’s senior vice president of product marketing. Batteries are more important than ever, as are touch-friendly displays. Windows manufacturers have been experimenting with convertible and detachable devices for the last few years, but the combination of Android and Chrome will actually make them work. The results are already starting to trickle out. Acer announced the Chromebook R13, which has a 1080p, 13-inch touchscreen that flips 360 degrees, along with 12 hours of battery, 4 gigs of RAM, and up to 64 gigs of storage. It’ll only get crazier from here: you’ll see laptops that are maybe more like tablets, a few that are maybe even a little bit like smartphones, and every imaginable combination of keyboard, trackpad, and touchscreen. Google and its partners all see this as the moment Chromebook goes from niche—for school, or travel, or your Luddite dad—to mainstream. “The ability to run their favorite apps from phones and tablets,” Ridling says, “without compromising speed, simplicity, or security, will dramatically expand value of Chromebooks to consumers.” When the legendary Walt Mossberg started his personal technology column at the Wall Street Journal in 1991, he opened with a now-classic line: “Personal computers are just too hard to use, and it isn’t your fault.” 25 long years later, that story’s finally changing. Chromebooks are exactly the computer the world needs now: simple, secure, usable. They just work. And starting this fall, they’ll work the way people do in 2016: online everywhere, all the time, in a thousand different ways. “Personal computing” left desks and monitors behind a long time ago, and personal computers are finally catching up.

Since 2012, Suman Prasad and his team have worked with various Silicon Valley venture capital firms to identify “rocketship” startups before they really take off, and they help plug them into the Google machine. They help them build apps for Android phones, hook into Android Pay, and make use of countless other Google services, from Google Maps to Google ads. Prasad started the project in his Google “20 Percent Time,” but it has since grown into something much bigger. He’s now director of startups and VC partnerships, and at any given time, Project Sand Hill now serves a good 100 US startups, plus about 30 abroad, including places like Israel, India, and China.

It has even reorganized itself into a new company. Alphabet is a way of cultivating the company’s internal “moonshots,” and Project Sand Hill is a way of keeping as close as possible to moonshots on the outside. In the end, this may be a path to strategic acquisitions. Plus, it can help maintain the profile of all those well-established Google technologies, like Android and Maps. This kind of thing is common practice across the tech world. Apple just opened a new accelerator in India meant to drive new iOS apps in the country. Current members of the program include ticketing platform Eventbrite, fitness-focused My Fitness Pal, and the last-minute hotel booking company Hotel Tonight. And according to Google, eleven Project Sand Hill companies have become “unicorns”—-startups valued at over a billion dollars—since joining the program, including Eventbrite, Houzz and Lyft. About half of the participating companies have gone on to raise an additional $7.5 billion in funding. Google wants another way of tracking the ever-changing tech landscape—and keeping its increasingly enormous company at the forefront of innovation. But where the program may be most useful is overseas. For Google—like so many other American tech companies—the big growth opportunity is in places like India and, just maybe, China, which has so very many people but is traditionally unfriendly to American tech companies. The best way into China is to partner with a Chinese company. Is this a good thing for the startups on the other side of the equation? It is, says Rouz Jazayeri, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, who introduced Google to My Fitness Pal. Initially, he was skeptical, but he quickly saw the value. “It delivered on its promise,” he says. “We had direct relationships and direct engagement with multiple product groups inside Google, and the company made that happen within a very short time frame.” This includes the teams running Google Fit, Android Wear, and Google Play. According to Mike Lee, the company’s CEO, it also got early access to new developer tools and advice on how to optimize Google ads. That just shows you how much Google values these relationships. If companies use its services, it sees, at least to a certain extent, where they’re going. It gets a lay of the land. This is the same side-benefit of running a cloud computing service: a window into the wide market. When you get big, you want as many of those windows as you can find. Go Back to Top.

By Kelly McSweeney for Robotics | September 9, 2016 -- 13:48 GMT (06:48 PDT) | Topic: Robotics Uber Automotive industry stakeholders have touted autonomous cars as being much safer than human drivers. According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 94 percent of crashes are caused by human error, so it seems that obvious that adding more automation will make cars safer. However, nonprofit public interest group Consumer Watchdog warns that the rush to deploy self-driving cars is dangerous. "We're very concerned that there is a real press to rapidly deploy these things too quickly," Consumer Watchdog Privacy Project director John Simpson tells ZDNet. "There needs to be very adequate safety precautions and procedures in place." On Wednesday Simpson, on behalf of Consumer Watchdog, sent a letter to Uber urging the transportation company to disclose the details of its self-driving vehicle fleet, which is about to be tested on public streets in Pittsburgh . He wrote, "You have opted to use public roads as your laboratory and with that comes a responsibility to fully disclose exactly what you are doing both when things go right and when they inevitably go wrong." Consumer Watchdog asked Uber to publicly report all crashes involving the test vehicles, plus any technical data and videos related to any crash. The letter also requests monthly reports similar to Google's reports, although it doesn't imply that Google's self-driving program is perfect. In fact, Simpson says he previously sent a similar letter to Google, and he is disappointed that Google hasn't released all of the data and videos from its trials. Lastly, Simpson asked Uber to publicly release "disengagement reports," which are annual reports that describe each time the technology failed. Read this ​Google's self-driving cars involved in 11 crashes Google comes clean on the number of accidents its driverless cars have been in over the past six years. Read More The letter also included a list of questions that he describes as "broader and more philosophical," in an effort to find out more about Uber's long-term vision for robotic cars. For example, "Will Uber's robot car prioritize the safety of the occupants of the vehicle or pedestrians it encounters ?" and "Does Uber have the technology to prevent malicious hackers from seizing control of a driverless vehicle or any of its systems?" We spoke with Simpson about Consumer Watchdog's trepidation with self-driving vehicles. He says that the main concern is that autonomous features are being overhyped and rolled out too quickly, with minimal testing and oversight because everyone -- even NHTSA -- is too enamored with the idea of self-driving cars. In reality, he says, the technology isn't ready yet, at least not with our current infrastructure. He explains: "If every single car on the road was a robot car and they were communicating with each other you might have, in some ways, a safer situation than you have now. But that's not what we've done, and that's not what we'll have for a long time. Right now the average age of an automobile on the road is something like 11-and-a-half years, so people are going to be holding onto their cars for quite a while. As new vehicles out with more and more autonomous driving features, the problem is going to be how those vehicles interact with your traditional car." He raises valid points, such as whether autonomous vehicles should be used in designated lanes. Industrial robots were fenced off from humans for decades, and they are only just now starting to become mobile and collaborative (able to safely work alongside people). So why should robotic cars be any different? Still, Uber's self-driving cars are expected to start picking up passengers on regular Pittsburgh streets any day now. They will have human drivers who are expected to intervene if needed, but as we've seen with Tesla's autonomous features, people tend to expect self-driving cars to do everything. Simpson fears that drivers are ignoring "fine print" style warnings about drivers being ultimately responsible, and they are expecting the cars to do more than they can. Regarding Tesla's autopilot feature, he says, "Even the name itself smacks of a promise that it can't keep." In June, a man was killed when a tractor trailer hit his Model S. Neither the driver nor the car's autopilot system noticed the truck against a brightly lit sky, so the brakes were not applied. Simpson thinks NHTSA "fell down on the job when it came to Tesla," and let the vehicles onto the marketplace without adequate oversight. NHTSA is expected to publish an updated autonomous vehicle policy this year, and that has Simpson seriously worried. He says: "I'm afraid that rather than remembering that their fundamental role is a regulator and protector of safety for highways, the top people of NHTSA have been kidnapped -- well, not kidnapped, but sort of taken over by the industry, and they're going to be out there promoting this whole policy. Mark Rosekind, the Administrator, and Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx are becoming promoters of the technology, rather than careful regulators, and I think that's a problem." While Simpson may be right about the need to proceed with caution, that doesn't mean that self-driving cars should be abandoned altogether. They certainly have the potential to create safer roads, reduce traffic, and let's not forget the convenience factor. People with disabilities such as blindness could gain independence, and commuters could sit back and relax while a robot carries them to their destination. As automakers continue to release new cars with more autonomous features, Consumer Watchdog suggests that drivers will need better training about the technology's limitations, and any company with a self-driving program must be completely transparent. "Answering our ten questions will help the public fully understand what Uber is attempting to do and the risks that are involved," Simpson wrote to Uber. "Full transparency about your planned self-driving robot car testing activities is the only acceptable approach." Consumer Watchdog has not received a response from Uber yet. ZDNet asked Uber and NHTSA for comment and will update the story if it receives one. Join Discussion Powered by Livefyre Add your Comment Related Stories Innovation Should we ban killer robots?

Lots of vague promises that don’t seem to be fulfilled ... Really it’s about building walls to make it hard to share the best ideas and to collaborate. And he seems to be successful even though he has a crazy user interface. I don’t understand how this works.”  Box CEO Aaron Levie made the joke at the Redwood City, Calif.-based company's annual customer conference, which finished yesterday in San Francisco.  This wasn't the first time Levie has taken a swipe at Trump, but in this case he was supporting the conference's broader message — the "all new Box" wants to take on legacy enterprise content management systems. The company revealed a number of new partnerships and capabilities to support this goal. 'All New Box' Takes Shape Among them was Box Relay for automated workflow creation, the first release from its year old partnership with IBM. The company also announced a partnership with Google, which will integrate Box's file storage with Google's Docs, Sheets and Slides as well as the Google Springboard search engine.   Those were the marquee moments at the conference, but other announcements added to the sense that this was, as Rand Wacker, vice president of Enterprise Products at Box described it, a "watershed" moment for the company.  Jeetu Patel, senior vice president of platform and Chief Strategy Officer at Box, wrote about some of the less glamorous releases aimed at helping developers and customers transform business processes. Beyond the Relay and Google announcements, releases included: Support for new content types: Support for several new file types including HD video, 360 images and videos, 3-D models and VR files. These new file types are available today for web applications and will be available for mobile in the coming months. Annotations and watermarking: New capabilities in the embedded preview of a file that allow end users to add annotations and developers to display a watermark on files that contain sensitive information. Annotations, available today in JavaScript and in the coming months for iOS and Android, allow end users to add point comments and highlight text directly on an embedded file preview. Box also introduced a redesigned developer console, overhauling the user experience and including a new user interface which offers guided walkthroughs for configuring applications, easy access to support, documentation and notifications.  Xerox Launches New Line of Printers Norwalk, Conn.-based Xerox Corp. continues to develop and push out new releases in spite of being in the middle of a restructuring which will see the company split into two companies: a document technology company and a business process outsourcing company.  Like others in the productivity space, Xerox is focused on increasing its products efficiency. Slow print speeds, poor image quality and complicated set ups are a few of the factors that impact productivity when it comes to printers and other document-related software and hardware. Xerox today introduced the Xerox WorkCentre Multifunction Printers (MFPs) and Xerox Phaser 3330, a set of new black-and-white printers that it claims anyone — even the least tech-savvy person in the office — can operate. The printers simplify set up and connect readily to mobile devices. Internal Wi-Fi connectivity and Near Field Communication tap-to-pair allow mobile workers to link their phones and tablets to print from any location. The new features aim to improve productivity and print quality, no matter the device used to send the job. PDsurF Smart PDF Platform Finally this week, Toronto-based PDsurF announced the beta launch of its smart, seamless PDF document and e-book management platform. The PDsurF platform uses machine learning and machine intelligence to help improve storage, search and findability of pdfs and e-books for those in the educational, professional, commercial and non-profit sectors. It also organizes online document libraries. The platform includes an online PDF document viewer and collaboration tools for users to view, highlight and annotate PDF content, as well as share documents and comments with teammates. PDsurF offers three different editions, including a free basic package. The Premium Edition costs $4.99 per user per month, and the enterprise edition adds substantial capabilities at an unknown cost.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Warren Report Why Is Facebook Censoring This Iconic Photo? Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Warren Report Why Is Facebook Censoring This Iconic Photo? This is what happens when Facebook’s nudity guidelines clash with powerful photojournalism. (A version of this column originally appeared on Poynter.org.) by James Warren, Chief Media Writer, Poynter.orgSeptember 9, 2016 10:00 am Email Facebook Twitter Drew Angerer/Getty Images It’s crazy. “Norway’s largest newspaper has published a front-page open letter to Facebook C.E.O Mark Zuckerberg, lambasting the company’s decision to censor a historic photograph of the Vietnam war and calling on Zuckerberg to recognize and live up to his role as 'the world’s most powerful editor.'” (The Guardian) This involves a Norwegian writer posting the Pulitzer Prize-winning shot by Nick Ut of children, including a naked 9-year-old girl, running from a napalm attack during the Vietnam War. Facebook suspended the writer's account, and the paper reported on the suspension with the photo on its own page. It prompted the social network to delete both the paper's article and the photo from Facebook. “Any photographs of people displaying fully nude genitalia or buttocks, or fully nude female breast, will be removed,” said Facebook to the Norwegians. It's a pretty outrageous move over an iconic image, as quickly perceived by Espen Egil Hansen, the editor in chief and C.E.O. of Aftenposten, the country's biggest paper. In his letter, Hansen alleges that Facebook is exhibiting an inability to “distinguish between child pornography and famous war photographs,” as well as an unwillingness to allow “space for good judgement.” “Even though I am editor in chief of Norway’s largest newspaper, I have to realize that you are restricting my room for exercising my editorial responsibility. I think you are abusing your power, and I find it hard to believe that you have thought it through thoroughly.” Hansen contends that instead of achieving Zuckerberg's stated aim to “make the world more open and connected,” the censorship “will simply promote stupidity and fail to bring human beings closer to each other.” Can one really argue? If Zuckerberg cares about matters of justice, he ought be reminded that it is in no small measure through the unadulterated horror of such imagery and reporting that the world gets at basic truth about many human actions, such as war. You've got to stare at our handiwork, not censor it. Geraldo turns on Ailes, calls TV culture endemic In a “Roger and Me” Facebook posting that wasn't deleted, Geraldo Rivera blasted his old boss. “The man we knew as the blustering genius who invented our mighty Fox News Channel is a deceitful, selfish misogynist, if the charges against him are true. And if they are true, then his shame and banishment are well earned. Like virtually all my colleagues at Fox News, I was totally blindsided by his sexual harassment scandal, which is why I responded to Gretchen Carlson’s initial filing of her lawsuit with extreme skepticism. The man she described in her pleadings was unknown even to those of us who thought we knew him well.” (Facebook) The morning chatter you perhaps missed Quinnipiac University should charge the cable news networks for all the time they waste regurgitating every facet of every poll by Quinnipiac, which is based in Hamden, Connecticut. It was the same this morning, especially on “Fox & Friends,” where Trump reporter John Roberts seemed quite upbeat detailing supposed Trump inroads, then this: “Pennsylvania still problematic, Hillary Clinton continues to lead by five points there, 48 to 43.” All in all, it seemed good news for the three co-hosts, let by Steve Doocy, all of whom also defended Matt Lauer's performance theater night. He's being “completely decimated by the political left because he did was too hard on her and he did not destroy Donald Trump,” opined Doocy. Over at “Morning Joe,” Mika Brzezinski went to bat for Lauer, too, with colleagues generally sympathetic to her basic take that he asked good questions of a guy, Trump, who even flummoxed Bob Woodward when he had a go at Trump once on the show. “People say, 'You need to ask the question,'” she said with her preternatural look of chagrin. “We are, people.” Got that? Over at CNN's “New Day,” there was actual reporting, not mere gabbing, on the very same matter, as the network went live to Geneva this morning for trusty international correspondent Nic Robertson to update likely-to-fail talks there about Syria between Secretary of State John Kerry and his counterpart. Yes, it would later be immersed in the presidential horse race, with a “winners and losers” list for the week past. But it was nice to see some actual journalism, too, including a later CNN live report from Tokyo on an apparently serious North Korean nuclear test. Can Google really slow down ISIS? “To deter potential ISIS recruits, Google is trying a new strategy. Jigsaw, Google’s technology incubator, has figured out words and phrases that people associated with ISIS often search for. The aim isn’t to track or identify them, but to change their minds; Jigsaw will seed the search results with ads that link to YouTube channels filled with anti-ISIS videos.” (Popular Science) Got the Hollywood bug? In an attempt to improve diversity in the rather homogeneous world of TV writing, the City of New York is combining with the Writers Guild of America, East, which has had great success of late organizing editorial workers at digital news operations. They'll offer a six-month fellowship to provide opportunities for wannabes from varied backgrounds to work in New York, which was home to 52 scripted TV series last year. The union says the “Made In NY Writing Room” will accept up to 12 applicants, either individuals or writing teams, to take part in the program. They'll get a stipend, participation in various professional development program and be twinned with what's known as a “showrunner” based on their career interests “and produce a table read of their script by union actors.” (Writers Guild of America) Mixed-media marriages Old media is doing lots of heavy investing in new media, like Comcast throwing tons of dough at BuzzFeed. But those alliances “are dotted with cases of new media biting the hand that feeds it.” (Bloomberg) Vice's founder takes old media largesse (notably from Disney) but bashes some as dinosaurs, describing media as a “private club, so closed that most young people feel disenfranchised.” Matthews vs. Giuliani It was a heavyweight matchup as grim and persistent Chris Matthews questioned the breezily self-confident Rudy Giuliani on “Hardball,” largely about Trump's kind words on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his many suggestions that Barack Obama was born outside the U.S. and thus not a legitimate president. Matthews was the anti-Lauer, especially in persisting in not letting the former New York mayor get away with baloney on the birth issue. Seeing Giuliani backtracking was unusual and a universe from the awed reverence he inspires on Fox News Channel. It's intriguing to consider what might happen if you'd had his inquisitorial modus operandi at play in one of the three presidential debates. He can be very effective, if very jarring. (Hardball) Troy Aikman's still pissed Former Dallas Cowboys star Troy Aikman, now a longtime Fox NFL analyst, remains furious that sportswriter/TV pundit Skip Bayless flicked at intimations Aikman was gay in a long-ago Bayless book. He's unfettered in his view of Fox hiring Bayless away from ESPN for its cable sports channel. A few days ago he made clear, “To say I’m disappointed in the hiring of Skip Bayless would be an enormous understatement. Clearly, [Fox Sports president of national networks] Jamie Horowitz and I have a difference of opinion when it comes to building a successful organization. I believe success is achieved by acquiring and developing talented, respected and credible individuals, none of which applies to Skip Bayless.” (Sports Illustrated) Now Forbes contributor Alex Reimer chides Aikman for lingering on the long-debunked rumor, even as he concedes it was pretty sleazy on the part of Bayless. (Forbes) A media writer cut loose Longtime Chicago media observer Rob Feder disclosed “the company's decision not to renew their licensing and marketing agreement on his website, RobertFeder.com.” (Patch He was told it was for business reasons but business includes a pretty thin skin of a new corporate regime. Feder is no bomb-thrower and his coverage of the regime, and its obvious missteps, has been fairly mild. It didn't get much more incendiary that his assessment of the new boss Michael Ferro, the previous boss of The Chicago Sun-Times, changing the corporate name to Tronc from Tribune Publishing: “As corporate names go, it’s even worse than Wrapports, which Ferro inflicted on the Sun-Times before the self-styled tech entrepreneur began his five-year reign of failure there.” What to do with the press and Trump, Clinton The attacks on Matt Lauer for his performance in interviewing the two presidential candidates get to larger questions involving uninspired performances by the press at many events during the campaign year. They were briefly flicked at in tweets after the New York event by Glenn Thrush, a fine political reporter for Politico. I followed up and discussed the matter with him. One issue: What do you do when you ask good questions and politicians simply evade a straight answer? Do you bring out your inner Chris Matthews and doggedly hammer the guy? Here's Thrush: “Polite-but-firm pushback is a skill every serious interviewer needs. Just watch a few YouTubes of the late Tim Russert—or watch debate moderator Chris Wallace on FOX, a very tough interlocutor who—to my complete mystification—declared that his job wasn't to fact-check the candidates. That's bullshit. Fact-checking is job one for any reporter.” (Poynter) A good man Marv Gittler, a beloved Chicago union-side labor attorney and tough teddy bear of a guy, passed away yesterday. We were united by our New York backgrounds, involvement with the labor movement and preference for Jack Daniels. His link to the media largely resulted from representing newspaper productions unions, including workers who struck the Chicago Tribune in 1987 and were replaced. He was a good source of mine, and I was fortunate for his post-strike Solomonic decision to cancel his subscription to the paper but continue being a source. Our primary difference was I remained a Giants fan, while he morphed into a season ticket-holding, long-suffering Bears fan. As I told a son-in-law yesterday, it was thus not unusual in succeeding years to pick up the newsroom phone and hear a gravelly voice simply declare, “So I hear I was quoted in the scab paper today.” Yup. As he lay at rest with a Bears knit cap Thursday (his four daughters thought it only fitting), we toasted him with a shot of Jack. Have a good weekend. Corrections? Tips?

SUBSCRIBE The unexpected impact of Google automated ad extensions What are automated extensions in AdWords, and how can they impact your PPC analytics and ad performance? Columnist Michelle Cruz explains. Michelle Cruz on September 9, 2016 at 9:48 am More When was the last time you reviewed your Google Account settings? I mean really took a deep look under the hood? I know that it’s not something I check often. Recently while analyzing account performance, I noticed a discrepancy in the number of leads obtained at the campaign level and keyword level. This led me to investigate further, and I discovered some interesting things about automated ad extensions. Automated ad extensions Automated extensions use search terms to dynamically generate informational snippets and/or links to your website below your ad text. These snippets help searchers learn more about your business. For example, in this ad you see automated extensions for consumer ratings. Here is a list of all types of Google automated ad extensions: Consumer ratings. Shown in the image above, consumer ratings are industry-specific ratings that appear below your search ad. These ratings are based on survey data collected by Google and its trusted partners, and they usually highlight specific aspects of the business (such as customer service, selection, fees, etc.), which vary by industry. This extension includes a clickable “Ratings” link that allows searchers to see additional ratings. Previous visits. This automated extension lets searchers who are logged into Google know if they’ve visited your site before from search results. The text shows the number of times previously visited, as well as when the last visit occurred. This can help your existing customers and prospects more easily navigate their way back to your website. Dynamic structured snippets. This automated extension is based on your page content. When Google finds information on your website that falls into a particular search category, it may display that information as a dynamic structured snippet if it deems that information beneficial to your ad performance. Seller ratings. Displayed as a star rating from one to five, seller ratings let searchers know how your business is rated. These seller ratings are taken from reputable sources that aggregate business reviews (see a list here). Dynamic sitelinks. This automated ad extension creates links to additional pages on your website below the main link featured in your ad. The links chosen might be based on popular website pages or links to pages related to the search query. (Note that sitelink extensions can also be done manually for better control over the links displayed.) Dynamic callouts. Similar to dynamic structured snippets, this automated extension highlights useful details about your business, products and/or services. (Note that callout extensions can also be done manually, and manual callouts will override dynamically created ones.) Extension display criteria When are automated ad extensions displayed? According to Google, whenever they believe that an automated extension will aid the searcher and improve ad performance. The criteria for showing automated extensions is part of the Google algorithm, and it is currently not possible to know exactly what will enable the extension to show. Keep in mind that if you have manual extensions set up within the account, those extensions will trump the automated extension, preventing it from showing. Conversion reporting Conversions obtained through automated extensions are reported holistically at the campaign level and are included in the total number of conversions reported in AdWords. When drilling down further into the campaign performance, these conversions are noted in the keyword tab under the total account, but are not reported at a more granular keyword level. This causes a discrepancy between account-level and keyword-level conversions. This also means that marketers are not able to optimize account performance based upon the auto extension performance — at the keyword level. To view the conversion data associated with the auto extension you will need to view the performance data within the ad extension tab within your AdWords account. There you will see which extension generated the conversion for the account. The conversion data will be noted under the specific extension category but no other data will be available. Automatic opt-in It wasn’t until I talked with Google about this conversion discrepancy that I learned that accounts were automatically opted into Google’s Automated Extensions when the feature rolled out of beta in August 2015. I believe that many marketers don’t realize this and aren’t aware of the potential impact. You can turn off automated extensions, however, and Google provides instructions for how to do so in the AdWords Help documentation: “To disable an automated extension:  Sign into your AdWords account. Click the Ad extensions tab. Click the “View” dropdown and select Automated extensions report.  Click Automated extension options (advanced). Click Edit next to “Show all automated extensions for this account”. Click Exclude specific automated extensions for this account.  Check the box next to the automated extension you’d like to disable.  Click Save.” My recommendation Digital marketers should realize that AdWords accounts have been opted into this program, and automated extensions may show. In general, my experience with automated extensions has been positive. These extensions typically do increase the total number of conversions obtained. My main concern is that I am unable to optimize the account performance at a granular level. With automated extensions, marketers do not have control regarding what Google is selecting to show to the searcher. Although you can see how the automated extensions are performing within your account, you are unable to optimize the extensions to improve performance. I recommend that you review the available data for your automated extensions. If you see that performance is improving, leave them live and continuously monitor results. Remember, you always have the option to opt out of certain extensions if they are not improving your digital marketing results.

SUBSCRIBE Google has updated the AdWords ad preview tool for expanded text ads The view now includes sample ads and separate views for mobile and desktop. Ginny Marvin on September 9, 2016 at 10:22 am More With expanded text ads now generally available and the October 26 cut-off for being able to upload traditional ads into AdWords looming, Google has updated the ad preview in the AdWords web interface. The update also seems to provide a better indication of whether a headline might get truncated. Spotted by Steven Johns at Door4 in the UK Friday morning, the new preview appears to be rolling out. I can now see it live in accounts. Google Testing New Create an Ad Preview and Sample Ad Feature? #ppcchat #ppc @WordStream @sengineland @GinnyMarvin pic.twitter.com/MuZlM3lD9F — Steven Johns (@stevenjohns21) September 9, 2016 The new preview tool has separate views for desktop and mobile and also has a separate section to view sample ds. Clicking on the View more link brings up a window with several more examples of expanded text ads from various industry sectors like this: In addition to helping advertisers transition to expanded text ads, the new preview tool update is likely also in response to concerns about some ads being truncated. The old version didn’t always indicate when the second headline might be truncated. The new version seems to be much more attuned to this issue. Here’s an example of the preview tool indicating the second headline will potentially be cut off on desktop (it shows fine in the mobile preview): In the example above, the headlines use a lot of high pixel characters (i.e. wide characters) which make it more likely to cut off. Google continues to advise that most advertisers take advantage of all the characters available and says truncation is not common. For marketers in highly regulated sectors that need to ensure full copy is viewable, Google suggests limiting the combined character count of the headlines to 33 characters. For most, however, the focus can be on writing effective ads. If you’re not already testing expanded text ads, here’s a look at some early results and suggestions for getting started.

Although the ins and outs of a handset can vary between phone makers, these Android shortcuts should work no matter what model of phone you're using. Here are 12 gestures you can use on Android that you might not know about. 1) Two-finger swipe down You can access the handy Quick Settings pane in Android by dragging down from the top of the screen to show your notifications, and then dragging down again. But if you use a two-finger swipe from the top of the screen, then the panel appears immediately, giving you instant access to switches for wi-fi, Bluetooth, airplane mode and the like. 2) Press and hold on notifications Google has gradually improved the way Android handles notifications in recent versions, and now everything works pretty smoothly when it comes to alerts. You can swipe to dismiss notifications, and in Nougat , you can press and hold to set preferences for that app. You can do it in Marshmallow too, but the settings aren't shown inline. 3) Press and hold to select Selecting text in Android is a cinch. In most Google apps, press and hold (or sometimes double-tap) somewhere on the screen to select a word, then drag out the handles on either side to highlight additional words. Third-party apps will occasionally behave differently. In Twitter for Android the same action copies text straight to the clipboard. 4) Swipe down from the Chrome address bar Do you have a lot of tabs open in the Chrome browser for Android? Want to switch between them quickly? You can tap on the tab number icon, but you can also swipe down from Chrome's address bar to see your open tabs instead. Alternatively, swipe left or right on the address bar to jump from tab to tab without having to visit the overview screen in between. 5) Press and hold Power Off If you're running into persistent problems with your Android handset then there's a built-in Safe Mode you can use to disable (and troubleshoot) third-party apps. Press and hold the power button to bring up the Power Off pop-up, then press and hold the pop-up to find the Safe Mode option. To get out of Safe Mode, just reboot your phone again. 6) Tap and hold the spacebar Google Keyboard has all kinds of neat tricks up its sleeve, and one that we often find useful is for moving the cursor. Rather than stabbing at the screen to try and position it, just tap and hold the spacebar and then move your finger left and right. It should work in most apps as long as you're in text editing mode (the cursor is already in another word). 7) Triple-tap to zoom in You can triple-tap to zoom in on websites, images, and anything else in Android, but you need to enable the gesture shortcut in the OS settings first. From Settings, choose Accessibility, then tap Magnification gesture and turn the toggle switch at the top to on. Underneath the setting itself you get a helpful explanation of how to use the feature. 8) Tap and hold on menus It's not all that much of a time saver, but we're going to take it anyway. In a lot of Google apps for Android (including Gmail and Chrome), you don't have to tap to open a menu and then tap again. Just tap and hold on the menu button (usually three vertical dots), then drag down to the option you want, then release your finger or thumb to make the choice. 9) Tap and hold for one-handed mode Here's another handy shortcut for the Google Keyboard. Tap and hold on the comma key, then slide up to the icon on the right to activate the keyboard's new one-handed mode. If you don't have both of your hands free then it makes text input much easier. Note that it only works if you're in portrait mode. 10) Long-press on an app icon If you head to the Overview screen (tap the square nav button), then long-press on the icon for an app, you get a shortcut link straight to said app's diagnostics screen (where you can close or uninstall it). You may have to enable developer options for this one to work, which you can do by tapping seven times on Build number in About phone in Settings. 11) Double-tap and hold to zoom An older trick, but one that plenty of people still haven't come across, and it often proves useful on the move. If you're using your phone with one hand, you can double-tap and then hold and drag in the Google Maps app to zoom in and out (drag down to zoom in and up to zoom out). The same trick also works in Google Maps for iOS, by the way. 12) Configure your own gestures This being Android, you can install a few third-party apps to configure some gestures of your own if you're not fully satisfied with the ones that come built into the OS. Draw an S on the screen to launch Settings, and so on. There are a few apps to choose from for the job, including All In One Gestures, Gesture Shortcuts and Finger Gesture Launcher.

By Saurabh Mukherjea, Prashant Mittal Published: Sep 9, 2016 4061 4061 Image: Shutterstock At Ambit we spend a lot of time reading articles that are not directly relevant to Indian stocks. However, since the Indian economy is now umbilically linked to its global counterparts, the articles that we come across have relevance for Indian stocks and the Indian economy. In that context, this report contains the ten most interesting pieces that we read this week. 1) Why the cost of living is poised to plummet in the next 20 years [Source: SingularityHub] Bestselling author Peter Diamandis pulls together a counter-consensus piece. He says “People are concerned about how AI and robotics are taking jobs, destroying livelihoods, reducing our earning capacity, and subsequently destroying the economy…But what people aren't talking about, and what's getting my attention, is a forthcoming rapid demonetization of the cost of living.” As per Diamandis, this drop in the cost of living will come from seven categories which are central to our lives: Transportation (cars will become a ‘service’), Food (cost of food has dropped thirteenfold over the past century); Healthcare (reduced cost of diagnosing and surgery); Housing (people will move out of cities and either use technology to work from home or use autonomous cars for commuting); Energy; Education (most education is already available online); Entertainment. 2) Ram Guha’s proposal to improve governance in India [Source: The Hindustan Times] This piece in argues that “from the level of joint secretary upwards, all government jobs should be subject to open competition. At that level one can bring in professionals with expertise, and yet allow them to grow in the State system, before assuming larger responsibilities.” In the United Nations’ Human Development Report India is a low 130th. Guha says that if we want to reverse this decline we have to bring in professional expertise into the upper echelons of the civil service. This will bring in talent, energy, expertise and the courage to stand up for their views since “to the deference to netas that comes so naturally to the typical IAS officer.” 3) Robots likely to worsen shortage of good jobs [Source: The Times of India] Swami Aiyar points out that all of its vaunted GDP growth, India simply fails to generate jobs. As a result, “When Amroha municipality advertised job vacancies for 114 posts of “safai karmachari” or sweeper, applications came from 19,000 people including MBAs and engineers.” Whilst the fantasists on the Government’s payroll talk about India creating jobs China-style in labour-intensive sectors like garments and shoes, Aiyar points out that is this unlikely to happen due to two reasons: (1) Economies like Bangladesh and Cambodia are beating India hollow thanks to lower wages and duty-free access into many foreign market (which successive Indian governments have failed to negotiate). (2) Robotisation is coming even to labour intensive sectors. 4) The five keys to a successful Google team [Source: Google] Google’s HR team wanted to understand what make a team great. Over two years they conducted 200+ interviews with their employees and looked at more than 250 attributes of 180+ active Google teams. They found that the qualifications and the individual attributes of team members were NOT the key drivers of a team’s effectiveness. “Who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions.” Google HR’s discovered that there are five key dynamics that set successful teams apart from other teams at Google:  Psychological safety: Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed? Dependability: Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time? Structure & clarity: Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear? Meaning of work: Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us? Impact of work: Do we fundamentally believe that the work we're doing matters? 5) The three breakthroughs that finally unleashed AI on the world [Source: Wired] Kevin Kelly explains why AI is about to take off and he seems to have the causal factors nailed down perfectly. Cheap parallel computation: A new kind of chip called a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has been developed to deal with the parallel processing requirements of graphics rich videogames. By 2009 a team of engineers at Stanford were using GPU chips to run neural networks in parallel thus laying the foundation of AI. Big data: “Massive databases, self-tracking, web cookies, online footprints, terabytes of storage, decades of search results, Wikipedia, and the entire digital universe became the teachers making AI smart.” Better algorithms: In the 1950s, scientists realised they needed to “stack” neural networks into various hierarchical layers - to recognise a human face, to recognise the eyes, to go deeper into a specific part of the eye, etc. In 2006 came the second breakthrough. “Geoff Hinton, then at the University of Toronto, made a key tweak to this method, which he dubbed ‘deep learning.’ He was able to mathematically optimize results from each layer so that the learning accumulated faster as it proceeded up the stack of layers. Deep-learning algorithms accelerated enormously a few years later when they were ported to GPUs.” 6) Why the hottest investment trend in the world could have worse economic outcomes than Marxism [Source: Business Insider] Passive investing is by far the defining investment trend of our time. A group of analysts at Bernstein led by Inigo Fraser-Jenkins argue that this trend towards passive reduces the efficiency of capital allocation in the real world. Fraser-Jenkins says that a centrally planned economy will produce better outcomes than an economy with lots of passive investing because there is at least an attempt is being made to optimally allocate capital whereas in the passive investing world there is no such attempt. Jesse Livermore, the pseudonymous finance blogger writing at Philosophical Economics. Livermore says that “it takes merely one active participant to facilitate an efficient market. Passive investing gets rid of the active (and also expensive) investors that stink.” Hence, as per Livermore, rather than make markets less efficient, “passive investing actually makes them more efficient because the only active participants left are competent.” 7) Building a Lifestyle: How the Dubai-based Group became a retail Landmark in India [Source: Outlook Business] The Dubai headquartered Landmark Group has built a successful retailing business in India – a sector in which it is notoriously difficult to make a profit – by spotting fashion trends abroad and then adapting them to India using the help of locally employed designers. Three factors seem to have played a key role: Private labels: Lifestyle has steadily developed private labels as the margins are attractive. The strategy has not been to compete with brands but to complete the offering. Velocity and asset turns: Lifestyle’s rivals says that amongst the leading retailers in India, Lifestyle places orders last i.e. it waits until the latest possible moment before ordering next season’s supplies for its stores. In its value conscious fashion offering, Max, Lifestyle moves goods through the supply chain and through the store at rapid speed. Lean operations: Lifestyle seems to have a leaner organisational structure than any other retailer in India. For a typical store, the firm uses a team of barely 6-7 people. 8) Star Trek at 50: Still an idealistic Enterprise? [Source: Financial Times] Star Trek turns 50 next month and whilst the recent Star Trek movie is nothing to write home about, there is much to celebrate about the original TV series which dominated US airtime in the 1960s. For example, right at the height of the 1960s Civil Rights movement, Star Trek aired an episode showing the lead actor, William Shatner, kissing his African-American lieutenant Uhura, played by Nichelle Nichols. Even more impressive was creator Gene Roddenberry’s scripting. Roddenberry, a former air force pilot and LAPD policeman, injected his stories and characters with liberal values, championing toleration, religious scepticism and peace among diverse peoples. Imagine the possibilities if we had TV producers of this calibre in contemporary India. 9) Humans are the main obstacle to the driverless revolution [Source: Financial Times] John Thornhill highlights that “Conventional cars are inefficient, dangerous and dirty..” So what is the way forward? Autonomous cars of course. “The widespread adoption of fully autonomous and, still better, electric cars could therefore be a massive boon to mankind. McKinsey forecasts that 15 per cent of new cars could be fully autonomous by 2030.” The problems that will get in the way. (1) Such cars find it difficult to replicate humans’ sensory abilities; e.g. How does a car distinguish between a plastic bag blowing across the road and a runaway dog? (2) Even if manufacturers of such cars come to fully trust them, it could take decades for consumers and governments to fully trust them not least because of the host of tricky issues posed by such cars; e.g. Autonomous cars will have to programmed to make a calculation that could kill bystanders or passengers to minimise overall loss of life. 10) Poolside working is no longer a sign of importance [Source: Financial Times]  In this typically biting piece, Lucy Kellaway says that this year whilst on her summer holiday she disconnected herself from work altogether and thus came back to her desk feeling refreshed and sharp. She then noticed – thanks to the several “out of office” messages she received – that several other people had begun doing this. In fact, even after multiple emails prompting these holidaymakers to respond, she could not get them to respond. She concludes therefore that “Bragging about not working on holiday seems to be part of a wider trend…in which fashionable execs flaunt not their long hours, but their short ones. To be emailing from the pool does not prove you are powerful, it is starting to be seen for what it is — a sign of weakness, poor time management and an inability to delegate.” - Saurabh Mukherjea is CEO (Institutional Equities) and Prashant Mittal is Analyst (Strategy and Derivatives) at Ambit Capital Pvt Ltd.

Version 2.0, released this week, now gives users the ability to edit Live Photos and turn them into shareable GIFs and video clips, making the images more accessible to those not using iPhones. The feature debuted with the excellent Motion Stills app Google Research first introduced the ability to edit Live Photos earlier this summer with the excellent Motion Stills app. That app searched your Camera Roll for Live Photos and edited them down into GIFs or movies with minimal shake. It was fun and the value was obvious. After all, what’s the sense in having great little clips attached to your images if you can’t share them to, say, Instagram? That feature has been rolled right into Google Photos 2.0. In addition, 2.0 also lets you share video clips on YouTube. For more granular edits, you’ll still need to download Motion Still, but all this represents a welcome update to what’s already a highly competitive photo service on iOS.

Advertisement Description Technical Change Log Comments How To Browse Privately In Google Chrome Google’s game changing browser Chrome combines sophisticated technology with a simple UI, to create a faster, safer and easier browsing experience. Launched in 2008, Google Chrome quickly dominated the browser market to become the most used browser globally within 4 years of its public release. Google’s rapid and continuous development cycle ensures the browser continues to compete with the other most popular and advanced web browsers available. Speed Perhaps the area Google invested most of its development time to differentiate from other browsers. Google Chrome launches extremely quickly from your desktop, runs applications at speed thanks to a powerful JavaScript engine and loads pages rapidly using the WebKit open source rendering engine. Add to this quicker search and navigation options from the simplified UI and you have a browser that is pretty hard to beat on speed, especially if gaming is your thing. Clean, simple UI Google Chrome’s most striking feature and a substantial factor in its popularity - the simple UI hasn’t changed much since the beta launch in 2008. Google focused on trimming down unnecessary toolbar space to maximise browsing real estate. The browser is made up of 3 rows of tools, the top layer horizontally stacks automatically adjusting tabs, next to a simple new tabs icon and the standard minimize, expand & close windows controls. The middle row includes 3 navigation controls (Back, Forward & Stop/Refresh), a URL box which also allows direct Google web searching and a star bookmarking icon. Extensions and browser settings icons line up to the right of the URL box. The third row is made up of bookmark folders and installed apps. Easily overlooked now, this clean UI was a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded toolbars of popular browsers pre-2008. Privacy Another hugely popular feature, Incognito mode allows you to browse privately by disabling history recording, reducing traceable breadcrumbs and removing tracking cookies on shutdown. Chrome’s settings also allow you to customize regular browsing privacy preferences. Security Chrome’s Sandboxing prevents malware automatically installing on your computer or affecting other browser tabs. Chrome also has Safe Browsing technology built in with malware and phishing protection that warns you if you encounter a website suspected of containing malicious software/activity. Regular automatic updates ensure security features are up to date and effective. Customization A vast selection of apps, extensions, themes and settings make your browsing experience unique to you. Improve productivity, security, navigation speed, pretty much anything you can think of with apps and extensions from the Google Chrome Store. Install themes created by top artists or make your own using mychrometheme.com.

It will be updated by Mozilla as more information becomes available. Please do not edit this page yourself; if you have proposed changes, email Gerv. The issues are in chronological order, and have been re-numbered from the original announcement to use letters with gaps in between, for possible future expansion. Contents 1 Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) 1.1 WoSign Response 1.2 Further Comments 2 Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) 2.1 WoSign Response 3 Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) 3.1 WoSign Response 3.2 Further Comments 4 Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) 4.1 WoSign Response 4.2 Further Comments 5 Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) 5.1 WoSign Response 5.2 Further Comments 6 Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) 6.1 WoSign Response 6.1.1 Bug N1 6.1.2 Bug N2 6.2 Further Comments 7 Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) 7.1 WoSign Response 7.2 Further Comments 8 Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) 8.1 WoSign Response 9 Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) 9.1 WoSign Response 10 Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) 10.1 WoSign Response 11 Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) 11.1 WoSign Response 11.2 Further Comments 12 Cross Signing Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. Further Comments The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation, it speaks to their control over their issuance process. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers, across a handful of different serial numbers. Here is one example. This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. It has come up in the ensuing discussion in m.d.s.policy but no additional formal response has been made. It is possible that WoSign's upcoming report will cover this. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. WoSign discovered the github misissuances due to a post-issuance review the following day, triggered by "github" being on their list of high-value domains. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw. It is not clear whether it was possible to do this in the standard workflow or if it required hacking form parameters. Given the number of misissued certs, the former seems more likely. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots. Symantec was penalised for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which we believe violates section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. Furthermore, when this clause was brought to their attention, they denied that any changes fell under it, and they attempted to suppress further information about the ownership transfer when it was brought to the community's attention. Full details can be found in the post in mozilla.dev.security.policy. WoSign Response We have not yet had an official response from WoSign or StartCom about this issue. Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is probably 67, but may be a few more or less. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, around 12th May 2015, WoSign started using a new certificate template for some of their SHA-1 issuances. This has a fixed notAfter date of 2016-12-29T16:00:00Z (i.e. midnight on 29th/30th December, CST). This may have been a (sensible) move to prevent accidentally issuing SHA-1 certs which ran into 2017. We have found 939 SHA-1 certificates with this fixed notAfter date, including the above three. Certificates issued using this template almost exclusively have notBefore dates on working days in China, suggesting they are issued by explicit WoSign employee action. All of them have notBefores between Monday and Friday, except for 13 on a Saturday and 66 on a Sunday. Of those 66, 4 have notBefores on 2015-09-06, a Sunday which was, unusually, a working day in China. The other 62 all have notBefores on 2015-12-20, which was a Sunday, and not a working day in China. This suggests that, for these 62, the notBefore does not reflect the actual issuance date. For these 62, the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated, and this is cryptographically provable) but where the SCT date is nevertheless (just) before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating would not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which, it is claimed, was not requested by the owner of that domain. However, it has not yet been possible to confirm that this cert has been misissued because the owner of the private key has not been located. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response This issue has been raised with WoSign, who are investigating the issue with Alibaba (owner of the domain in question). This issuance used website control validation, which WoSign has since stopped doing. We await their fuller response. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the intermediate/root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. A security investigator used the value "1", and acquired two certificates which had notBefore dates (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which were signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. Cert 1, Cert 2. The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48, released on 1st August 2016. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. Further Comments This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Tag News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted Journalist Account PRNewswire Distribution Search Businesses Need Search Experience Optimization Search Experience Optimization or SXO is the practice savvy business site owners will emphasize to 'win' the search game and better serve their customers in 2016 and beyond.   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Search Engine Optimization * Search Experience Optimization * Business Customer Service By Industry: * TechnologyTAMPA, Fla. - Sept. 9, 2016 - PRLog -- "I believe that all brands will become storytellers, editors and publishers, all stores will become magazines, and all media companies will become stores. There will be too many of all of them. The strongest ones, the ones who offer the best customer experience, will survive," (Renowned Businesswoman & Journalist Dame Natalie Massenet, MBE, DBE) What is Search Experience Optimization? SXO a.k.a. Search Experience Optimization is the process of improving the ability of users to positively interact with and experience the elements within a website, such as its content and design elements. Many web-centric organizations leverage tools such as user personas, usability tests, UXA's a.k.a. user experience assessments, etc. in order to deepen their understanding of their target user's online expectations, preferences, and goals. In other words, it's all about building a better, more user-friendly world wide web for everyone. But how do you get millions of website owners and contributors to get on board this progress plane and commit to revamping and building websites with users in mind? Step one: You get search giants, like Google to prioritize and incentivize the process in order to get the ball rolling, worldwide. And Google is indeed beginning to encourage this by rewarding websites that put interaction and experience at the center of development, design, and content for the web with better ranking in their SERP's (i.e. Search Engine Results Pages). As a result, Search Experience Optimization will be an increasingly important focus for today's search and marketing specialists. What Matters in SXO? In order to measure and isolate areas for improvement through SXO, analysts will leverage information from the factors that are most likely to have a heavy influence on the willingness of a site's target customers to visit and interact (e.g. read content, play videos, click links, share data, etc.) within it. This includes the website's speed, navigation layout, mobile responsiveness, etc. Other influencing factors that have remained paramount are content, links, and metadata. All of these factors are taken into account by Google's search algorithm, which directly impact the ability of different websites to rank within SERP's, because they tell search engines (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, etc.) how well the website answers a question posed by a customer in a way that is user-friendly. Site owners can succeed in this venture (answer question and serve customers) by collaborating with experienced search and marketing specialists, to analyze, review, and implement the changes necessary to maximize traffic to and user experience within the site. What's the Future of Search & Marketing? Just as SEO (Search Engine Optimization) has matured and expanded over the years, marketing strategies will be continually adapted and revamped as we forge further into an increasingly digital future. So, you can continue to stay ahead of the curve and better serve your customers by readily seeking new and more effective methods to improve your website to meet customer needs. Collaborate with search and marketing specialists to discover the various qualitative and quantitative insights you'll need to implement responsive changes for your site's visitors, successfully.

Basically the question was does Google expect a site that sees more traffic to also see more links and if not, the rankings might decline? Here is the actual question: Would you say that the more traffic the site receives from google, the more links and recommendations should that site generate in order to stay ranking and move to a higher level? Here is John's answer: I don't know. Sometimes that happens naturally, sometimes that doesn't happen so naturally. I think that isn't necessarily related directly so it's not the case that we say. oh we send you this much traffic therefore we expect you to get more links over time because of that. That's usually not not the way that it works. Here is the video embed at the start time: Forum discussion at Google+.

WTF does that mean? whatsheorderfishfilet 09/09/2016 12:40 pm No one knows what it means, but it's provocative. It gets the people going! Donald 09/09/2016 12:44 pm The goofiness of some of those hangout questions is amazing. Why would anyone think that Google would expect more links as a result of more traffic, or even correlating to more traffic? It's not like Google sees a site with lots of traffic and says "Where is this coming from? Let's downgrade it!" LJ 09/09/2016 01:22 pm "I don't know" "Not usually" - hardly fills with confidence does it? Jim 09/09/2016 01:25 pm Double negatives result in a positive. Technically, what this quote means is: "That's usually the way that it works." snuffy 09/09/2016 01:25 pm I think that we hear "shoot from the hip" answers in these hangouts.

Billy Mays 09/09/2016 01:41 pm That might be the strangest question that I've ever heard.

I think I'd start yelling and break something. Adam 09/09/2016 03:38 pm Lol, did someone seriously ask this question? This post made my morning, I actually chuckled IRL. newyorker_1 09/09/2016 04:00 pm SEO is paranoid business.

Rashid Follow InfoWorld | Sep 8, 2016 3:00 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Java Security Java Android Developer Mobile Mobile Java Comments Google fixed more than 50 issues in multiple libraries, the Android kernel, Mediaserver, various hardware drivers, system applications, and networking components as part of its September Android Security Bulletin. The most noteworthy flaws addressed are the critical remote code execution bug in Mediaserver and a pair of critical elevation of privilege bugs that make up the QuadRooter flaw publicly disclosed in August. [ Android is now ready for real usage in the enterprise. Read InfoWorld's in-depth guide on how to make Android a serious part of your business. | Get the best office apps for your Android device. ] Mediaserver back in spotlight The remote code execution flaw in Mediaserver (CVE-2016-3862) was similar to the set of Stagefright vulnerabilities disclosed a year ago. While Stagefright and many of the later-disclosed Mediaserver flaws primarily focused on video files, this particular bug affected how Android's Mediaserver component processed EXIF (location) data in JPEG images, said Tim Strazzere, the SentinelOne researcher credited with finding and reporting the vulnerability to Google. Android apps typically use a Google-provided library to handle EXIF data, but the bug in the library was causing memory corruption during media file and data processing. "Just displaying a photo in Gmail or Gchat would crash the Android phone," Strazzere said. While Strazzere didn't test social media apps, he said they would also likely be affected by the bug because using that library is the correct way to handle images. Sharing images is common behavior and an easy attack vector. One of the initial workarounds for Stagefright was to turn off autoplay for video files, but there's no autoplay for images. All the attacker has to do is send an image and have the app display the image as a preview to exploit the flaw and remotely execute code on the user's device. Media codecs are notoriously difficult to write safely since they touch multiple low-level components and have to handle different input types, said Strazzere. Developers typically gravitate toward C when dealing with these kinds of operations, but doing so increases the chances of introducing memory-related vulnerabilities. Google could have fixed the bug with what Strazzere described as a "two-line fix." Instead, the company rewrote in Java an entirely new library to handle EXIF data. The Android team could have made the decision because it wanted a more straightforward method to handle the data or because it found more vulnerabilities in the library and decided starting over was best. Regardless of the reason, the decision was "appropriate," as it completely removed a whole class of potential vulnerabilities, Strazzere said. The Mediaserver flaw is fixed for all Android devices and Nexus models running Android 4.4.4 and later. While Nexus devices have received the patches in the bulletin, other Android devices have to wait for carriers and handset manufacturers to prepare the update. Depending on the OEM and carrier, some devices may never receive the update at all. There is no patch for older handsets running Android 4.3 and earlier. Quadrooter completely fixed Google also fixed the remaining two vulnerabilities that make up the Quadrooter flaw affecting multiple Qualcomm components. The privilege escalation bug in the kernel (CVE-2016-5340) and the privilege escalation flaw in the Qualcomm networking component (CVE-2016-2059) could be used to bypass existing mitigations in the Android kernel and give attackers root privileges. The flaws are in Qualcomm drivers controlling communication between different chip components. "An elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in the Qualcomm networking component could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This issue is rated as High because it first requires compromising a privileged process," Google wrote in the Android Security Bulletin. The other two Quadrooter bugs were patched in July and August. Combining all four Quadrooter bugs could result in complete compromise of Android devices. Quadrooter was publicly disclosed by researchers from Check Point Software at this year's Defcon in Las Vegas. It could potentially affect 900,000 Android handsets, many of them from popular manufacturers such as Samsung and Motorola, and all the attacker would need to do is trick the victim into downloading a malicious app. "An elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in the kernel shared memory subsystem could enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. This issue is rated as Critical due to the possibility of a local permanent device compromise, which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the device," Google wrote in the Android Security Bulletin. Nexus devices received the over-the-air update while other Android devices will have to wait for handset makers and carriers to roll out the update. Google published three different patch levels in this month's update: Sept. 1, Sept 5, and Sept. 6. Only devices that receive the Sept. 6 updates will receive fixes for Quadrooter. "Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to the latest version of Android where possible," Google said. This story, "Google squashes another Mediaserver bug in Android" was originally published by InfoWorld.

Photo: Pavan Trikutam/Unsplash It’s time we re-examine the user experience of calling an individual. Voice mail was labeled as the brain child entrepreneur, Gordon Matthew, back in 1979. Throughout the 1980s it gained in popularity, but required such complex systems that only large corporations could afford the technology at the time. Over 30yrs later, the “experience” of calling another person has yet to be re-examined. Visual Voicemail We saw a huge advancement to voice mail in 2007 with the release of Visual Voicemail on a new device called the iPhone. Apple’s Visual Voicemail on iPhone6 Screenshot: Author provided No longer would you have to call your phone and hit “*” or “#” to access voice mail. You could SEE it. It was right there. The person’s name or number When they called Length of the message The city & state the area code was based in This was incredible. What it failed to do was re-examine the purpose behind voice mail. To ask, “why” is someone calling someone in the midst of this text messaging generation. While Visual Voicemail did eliminate the awful process of calling in and listening to voice mails one at a time, the process itself remained unidimensional. The Missed Call Voice Mail From here we began to turn on voice mail. To get upset when people would leave voice mails that just said, “Hey, it’s Jen. Call me back!” Instead, we began to rely on missed calls as a means of saying, “hey, call me back” without actually saying, “hey, call me back.” Voice Mails to Text Google‘s’ transcribed voicemail service through the Google Voice App Photo: Author provided We saw a larger market adoption of this technology when Google added this functionality to the list of benefits included with its Google Voice service. Google Voice has still yet to receive the notoriety it deserves for detaching “phone numbers” from physical devices, but that’s a tale for another time. I’d expect Apple to adopt something similar to voice mail transcriptions in the next couple years. Video Voice Mail Believe it or not we have something extremely similar to Video Voice Mail already, it’s called Snapchat. I had expected Apple to be the first one on the scene with this as a part of FaceTime. The fact that you still can’t leave a FaceTime voice mail is already rather discouraging when you think about it. Though these systems certainly add value to the voice mail system, there’s still an underlying root factor — what is the reason for the call and how do we communicate it? Why Do We Call? Voice mail carries no level of priority with it. I mentioned voice mail being unidimensional because the girl in this photo only has 2 options when she reaches that person’s voice mail box. Why do we call? Photo: Gordon Matthew/Unsplash Leave a message Just hang up and don’t leave a message With the amount of communications performed per day, this method simply does not hold up. We have different needs when calling, different levels of priority. So, let’s break it down. Purpose of Calling: To speak with another individual at that moment Level of Importance: Varies Common Responses: Leaving a name and number with a message requesting you “call back” Priority Messaging What we need is a system in place that allows a user to specify the priority of the call, with the option to leave a voice mail. Currently, taking no action will lead a user directly into a voice mail system — leading to quick hangups, messages saying “call me back”, and the infamous “butt dial”. I propose an action-based system that allows a caller to choose a number, based on the priority of the message. For example: Caller pushes, or says, 1 — text message sent with contact information and a request to call back immediately. Caller pushes, or says, 2 — text message sent with contact information and a request to call back when available. Caller pushes, or says, 3 — text message sent with contact information and a notification that no call back is needed. Caller pushes, or says, 4 — connected to audio voicemail. We already have the ability to move between phone calls and text messages. I believe transcription services take it too far. If I wanted to leave a transcribed version of my message, I could just as easily text it to the person I’m trying to reach. To send a general call back request with a level of priority seems to be a much more valuable use of time and resources for something as simple as connecting with another individual. Do you have any fun tricks, or work arounds to using voice mail? I’d love to know how else you might be using voice mail to communicate with people—if at all.

Soon you’ll be able to do just that in Dana Point. For the past month, Orange County Parks has had hikers walk the trails along Dana Point to collect imagery for Google. This is the first time the county has teamed up with Google for the program, according to Marisa O’Neil, OC Parks public information officer. The program started in August and uses Google Street View Trekker, a wearable backpack with a camera system on top, to capture the images of the trails. It will create a 360-degree panorama that will be in Google Maps. O’Neil said the county is continuing the mapping process, but is still in the beginning stages.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple You can now install Chrome extensions remotely from an Android device Kyle Wiggers Digital TrendsSeptember 9, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share A new Chrome Web Store feature allows you to install games and apps to signed-in devices remotely, from an Android smartphone or tablet. It's rolling out in the coming weeks.More Ever find yourself browsing the Chrome Web Store while you’re out, and then you stumble upon a really awesome extension or app, and wish desperately that you could install it right that minute to your idling home computer? It may have once been the stuff of dreams and science fiction, but on Thursday, Google introduced a new Web Store feature that accomplishes exactly that: a button which installs extensions to the desktop or laptop Chrome installation of your choice. It’s simple, in theory. As Android Police uncovered, when you visit an extension’s Web Store page on your phone, you’re presented with two options: sharing it with a friend via e-mail or social media, or “adding it to your desktop.” If you opt for the latter option, an informative pop-up will alert you to the fact that the extension in question will be installed “[to] any computers where you are signed in to Chrome.” Dismiss it, and the extensions will automatically begin downloading on any Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, or Linux machine on which you’ve configured — and associated your account with — Chrome. Related: Google confirms: Chrome OS is getting Android apps and the Play Store The feature is not unlike Google’s remote app installation for Android. Users of Google’s mobile operating system have the ability to install apps and games from the Web to a signed-in Android smartphone or tablet. But remote Chrome app installations, unlike the Play Store feature, appear to lack any sort of management capabilities beyond simple installation. In 2012, Google introduced a “My Android Apps” software management section to the Play Store (which has since become outmoded), that allowed the remote uninstallation of apps on Android devices. Remote Chrome extension installations are relatively painless right now, but are also clunky. There’s no way to trigger remote installations to individual machines rather than to every instance of Chrome to which you’re signed in. And worse, there’s no way to browse the Chrome Web Store from a mobile device — as of publication time, you get an error message suggesting you use a “supported” operating system such as Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, or Linux. But it’s early days. Related: 25 extensions to super-charge your Chrome browser The new feature might be perceived as another step toward a long-rumored merger of Chrome OS and Android. Earlier this year, in May, Google rolled out the Play Store on Chrome OS devices — an addition which saw Chromebooks gain the ability to install and run Android apps. That’s no accident. Last year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai named Hiroshi Lockhimer senior vice president of Android, Chrome OS, and Chromecast. And in 2015, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google had been working for years to merge Chrome OS and Android, and that it planned to launch the result — a new, unified operating system that worked on PCs — in 2017.

The added feature means Google Photos can now freeze the background in Live Photos or create sweeping cinematic pans, and save the resulting creation as a looping video. In addition, the latest update to Google Photos includes the ability to sort photos in albums chronologically or by recently added. Google says it has also listened to feedback and users can now choose new thumbnails for faces in 'People' photo collections. Users can learn more about the technology behind Motion Stills stabilization here. Google Photos is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store.

Google's secretive research laboratory is trying to build a fleet of drones designed to bypass earthbound traffic so packages can be delivered to people more quickly. (AP / Google) Relaxnews Published Friday, September 9, 2016 7:05AM EDT Astro Teller, playfully referred to as the 'Captain of Moonshots' at an X lab created at Google to pursue big-vision projects such as drones and self-driving cars, said in a blog post that Project Wing team was ready to launch the test of a prototype drone delivery system. US officials announced last month that Alphabet is joining tests for drone deliveries, as the White House unveiled accelerated rule-making for commercial unmanned aircraft operations. Teller said that a Wing prototype is ready for testing and that the team will run hundreds of flights in Virginia over the course of several days to deliver lunches prepared in an on-site food truck by Mexican food chain Chipotle. "We want to learn how people feel when they're receiving a package by air, and taking someone's time and/or money changes things more than a little," Teller said. "And we want to feel the pressure of unexpected circumstances that show us how we can get better at loading and managing a fleet of planes." The Project Wing team opted to try out delivering food to create operating challenges including "a lunchtime rush of burrito orders" as well as having to get food to customers hot and in the right shape, according to Teller. "In future tests, we could add a broader range of items, like drinks, which will push us to handle more weight, keep packages carefully balanced, and manage combinations of items on a single flight," he added. He believes drones will be available within the next decade for important missions such as delivering medicine and other supplies to areas cut off by disasters and helping emergency responders battle wildfires. At a "White House Drone Day" event last month, officials announced steps toward expanding rules for drone operations, including for newsgathering and commercial flights over populated areas, after a first set of regulations unveiled in June. "We hope to propose a rule on unmanned aircraft operations over people by the end of this year," Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Huerta said. The government has registered more than 500,000 hobby drones in eight months, but sees a need for more rules for commercial operators, he added. The first set of rules stop short of allowing some long-sought applications, including delivery of goods by retailers like Amazon in populated areas. As the world's largest online retailer, Amazon raised eyebrows in late 2013 with its plan to airlift small parcels to customers by drone in select markets less than 30 minutes after orders are received. It has gone to other countries to test its evolving technology, and last month announced plans for test deliveries in Britain. "We're excited about Prime Air -- a future delivery system from Amazon designed to safely get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using small unmanned aerial vehicles," the online retail titan said in a message at its website. "Putting Prime Air into service will take some time, but we will deploy when we have the regulatory support needed to realize our vision."

A few weeks ago I was lucky enough to be asked to speak at the A4U Europe Conference in Barcelona. One of the panels was looking at the future of affiliate marketing, and the last question that we were posed was as follows: “What is the number one hint you could give an affiliate?” The answer given elicited a round of applause from the audience – which was made even stranger as my rebuttal was: “Stop being an affiliate, take control of the conversion funnel, and build something with substance and value.” Now that may have seemed a crazy thing to say, especially at an affiliate focused conference, but allow me to qualify my reasoning. Affiliates lack control Building a credible business which attracts converting traffic is neither an easy, nor a cheap matter for most businesses. Content production and marketing costs alone can run into the tens of thousands of dollars for even a reasonably basic site. If your investment hinges on the conversion abilities of another merchant, you are exposing yourself massively to that other brand. Apart from the lack of influence in the conversion funnel, as an affiliate you are also losing (most of the time) the ability to market and remarket directly to your qualified leads – the people that have purchased a product previously after being through your site; aka your customers. The last thing on a the topic of control is the ability to run specific campaigns that work for your customers – merchant websites generally have to cover as wide a set of demographics as possible, but you might operate within a very distinctive niche which may have specific needs. Affiliate websites are hated by Google This is a tough one, affiliate websites have for the past few years been one of Google’s main projects to make life difficult in the results. This may seem unfair, but if we switch things around and look at this from the search engine’s perspective, I think its perfectly reasonable. Let’s say you were looking for a hotel in Southern Spain for a family holiday, and you google something relevant, maybe “family hotels costa del sol”, and the first ten results are all pretty much carbon copies of each other, that’s hardly a good experience for the consumer. That’s why google have really cracked down in the last two years on affiliate sites built using database information as opposed to unique content. To break it down simply, its pretty easy to spot which sites have been created by some clever manipulation of data files (be it a list of hotels from Expedia, right through to a list of discount codes from an affiliate network), as opposed to a site which has been hand written with unique and interesting information. So what’s the solution? The perfect solution is to stop sending your valuable traffic to a merchant site to convert – vertical integration of the supply path. That’s simply not a practical proposition though for most affiliates in most industries. I spent many years working in the online gambling industry, where developing your own product can costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, and even white label solutions start in excess of $20,000 in set-up costs. Luckily travel doesn’t operate like that – there are plenty of fully white label solutions out there which are free to use and get setup on, from almost every main supplier of travel products. With these products you can offer a seamless experience to your visitors by allowing them to find your site, research the product on your site, and convert on your site. Crucially of course, you then keep the data, and they “purchased” the product from you, NOT from the merchant, therefore you are more likely to receive the added benefit of repeat orders. Another consideration here is one of branding – when you are looking to build a business with longevity online, the branding is one of the primary assets. After all, with an online (affiliate model) business physical location and stock etc. rarely come into play. An example from another vertical is moneysavingexpert.com – on the face of it, it is just a financial affiliate site – but as a brand it has become synonymous in the UK with financial products, which is why it managed to sell at a value in excess of $130 million. That valuation is based on the brand of the website, NOT the revenue. More examples (again from the finance industry) of the importance of the brand, is the extraordinary lengths major affiliates are going to these days even where it seems impossible to build something that is fun, on topic and resonates with consumers. UK financial services site CompareTheMarket realized this in the creation of its Meerkat campaigns; GoCompare likewise with the tenor campaign – and the list goes on. That’s the secret sauce that every merchant operates their affiliate program in the knowledge of. While the affiliates might refer good leads at an expensive cost (vertical dependant), merchants are fully aware that they get to keep the repeat business, and even if no sale is made they get qualified traffic for free – additionally helping the branding. Attracting the customers in the first place though is one of the toughest parts of the value chain. Don’t sacrifice any more of your marketing efforts – bring your sales funnel in house using white label solutions, and build additional value into your business!

Reply 2 months ago   Kevin May @michael – errr, obtaining a white label for your site would mean that you ARE an affiliate of another site 😉 Reply 2 months ago   Riyaz Yes, but doing a private label program, is as good as having your own site. Reply 2 months ago   Kevin May @riyaz – yes, but you are still commercially just an affiliate of another service. 2 months ago   Stephen Just how honest are OTAs? I was with Priceline with a white label affiliate incorporated into my travel site for several years and I can honestly say that OTAs are not, at least I know for a fact that Priceline is not honest at all. Whether Expedia is or not, I can’t say but given that every affiliate I’ve talked to and read about online in regard of lack of conversion, I don’t think Expedia is neither. Obliviously, there are hundreds of thousands of affiliates who have abandoned their sites around the world, realizing that they’re not making a dime yet their portals are still active online from every OTA, particularly travel agents who get them from their agencies. It’s now the norm that affiliates, even those attracting thousands of potential clients to their sites simply don’t convert and we’ve to talk the word of OTAs. However, it’s worth questioning who control the entire booking process and just how hard is it to manipulate? Not hard at all, it’s a simple matter of enabling/disabling the booking report with a click of the mouse and that’s it. Two incidents were enough for me to be convinced Priceline was intentionally manipulating my traffic and not reporting sales honestly. The first incident went on for 2 years unwillingly to my knowledge and without my consent, visitors were being redirected to Booking.com, which is a substitute of Priceline, to continue with the reservation process… I found that out by chance while working on my site and testing different options that whenever a visitor selected to book over 4 rooms, they were automatically transfer to Booking.com and I wouldn’t get credit for the reservation. Being upset about this cheating is probably a polite way to say it but I had to call my Priceline rep to have that feature disabled. Apparently, this feature is enabled by default to every Priceline white label and affiliates alike when you sign up. It took me 2 years to find out and I’m certain that there are thousands of serious affiliates out there who don’t know yet this is happening to them as well… If you were to look at the bigger picture, Priceline has between 200,000 to 500,000 affiliates including travel agents around the world. If this scheme is only happening to 10,000 active sites, that’s hundreds of thousands potentially reservations, worth several millions of dollars in revenue every year going directly to Priceline without affiliates getting a cent!!! The second incident was equally troubling, after contacting Priceline to complain about an ad campaign resulting in zero sales, attracting 40,000 visitors to my site within 3 months and NADA, I was pissed off. I never seen any crap like that in my years of online marketing. Shocking enough, the very next day after I talked to the president of Affiliate program, a reservation showed up and within two weeks, 3 sales were reported, then stopped. I really believe they waited to see what I’d do, trying to figure out if I knew something was going on or not but the fact was I didn’t have any proof to harass them with. Ok, I don’t believe in coincidences, much less miracles. I’m an IT guy, familiar with coding and the net. I know for a fact that people booking hotel rooms are not all that sophisticated with the internet. There’s no way anyone can convince me that the millions of visitors are all just shopping around when it comes to affiliates… This rational is just complete non sense, any intelligent person can attest to that. Period! There are millions of people out there who have the means and don’t have appetite to waste hours, looking for the perfect deal, that’s total BS. I think what OTAs are doing, especially with Priceline and Expedia since they own the rest, has become a policy to cheat for as long they can get away with it. What makes it even worst when reading the contract to realize you can’t sue these idiots. Rather, you’ve to go through some stupid arbitration which damages are capped to $100,000 maximum, if they’re found at fault. What’s 100K compare to the millions of dollar that they’re stealing? Nothing! That’s a very smart close for Priceline at least, every lawyer I talked to wouldn’t touch this case because of that F*** close. I guess we’d have to wait until someone rat them out about all these frauds to come out. And it would come out soon or later… If you think OTAs would cheat because they’re making billions, you need to wake up and smell the rose. Corporates cheat every day in America, until they’re caught they’ll keep doing it while making hundreds of millions of dollar in the process and affiliates are getting royally screwed, and they want you to like it… LOL Reply 6 months ago   Riyaz Lakhani Hi Stephen, I have been in the travel business for more than a decade and have worked with all these jokers (as you call them). One thing that I learnt was never to send the hard earned traffic that you get to your website away to them. You are not the only person I have heard who has been cheated by Priceline. I have therefore helped my clients build the end-to-end booking system that does not let the traffic go away to any other site.Not even the parent site. I have had many discussions with priceline to help us with the API, but as you have rightly said, they don’t want to give the API program as then, they would lose out on all the revenue. Thankfully, Expedia Affiliate Network, does not do that. They give the API for OTA’s to consume. You are welcome to try it out. It is built using the wordpress platform and comes with a onetime investment fee of $199 only. Reply 2 months ago   Sue Hi Martin, I promote travel insurance on my travel website, as a Globelink Affiliate. And have small success in it. I generate 5-10 sales each month. Not to many, but this is regular income. Reply 8 months ago   Claude Gelinas I’m done trying to promote travel deals, as an Expedia Affiliate. Tried for years to make a buck and ended up making a big, fat ZERO. Not a single cent. Maybe Expedia sold rooms and never told me but basically, this has been a waste of my time. To be fair, other revenue streams have gone dry, since 2009. May it be pay-per-click that’s bringing in dollars per day when it was hundreds of dollars before the 2008-2009 crash or even local advertisers who have turned overly skittish. So for revenue, it’s back to consulting because the entire advertising bandwagon isn’t what it used to be. Maybe it’ll come back but for now, affiliate-linking or white-labeling doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. Here’s an idea, build your own social network and bank on some sort of membership to make a decent living. Reply 12 months ago   Doug B Hi Martin I use EAN to direct our trade show users to your hotels in selected area. We get thousands of users check out the hotels we recommend but many move on to other sites to get a better deal and since we’re their first look they check around and book with some one else. Since all offer same price I had an idea to give the users a cash back ( points) like 3 percent on their credit card like the credit cards do when the stay is complete , of course the cost would be covered by us either from our commission or an account we set up. most of our customers are business travelers and would love this. Is this something EAN could do or any one else, I am a programmer and we do have a decent budget if we could this. thanks for your time Doug Reply 1 year ago   Riyaz Lakhani Hi Doug, If you are a programmer and have consumed the api, you can offer a cash back option. One of my clients has implemented a cash back of approx 5% on the booking. This is given to the buyers pay pal account 30 days after the stay. We have recently programmed the system to give cashbacks on hotels that are only $100 plus. Hope this helps. Reply 1 year ago   Jules Very true, I have had my blog for approx 5 months and I am finding it incredibly difficult to get visitors to spend on any of my Affilaite Banners or deep links. I am getting 5%-10% of my monthly unique visitors clicking on them, just not spending a cent! I don’t have a lot of money, but what I do have pays for Facebook promotions, and a little advertising here and there with other sites etc. I am not getting any return. With the thousands of blogs and websites starting each month and everyone trying to make it big, there is just to much competition. Googleads cost me $700 in one week just to try and get my blog noticed, I simply can’t afford that, and I converted none! Reply 2 years ago   Riyaz Lakhani Hi Jules, Affiliate banners is a kind of referral affiliate marketing and as your rightly said is going out of fashion. You now need to convert a shopper to buyer on your own website. By spending a little over $5 per day on facebook, you can get good amount of visitors to your site. And if you are writing about travel, you can include the deep links of your locations and hotels from your own site in the blogs to get the good inbound links. Reply 1 year ago   Shehab Hi Martin, Thanks for the useful topic. Would ypou list to us the Affiliate programs which allow us to use their content on our website for better SEO , content strategy management ? Reply 2 years ago   Blade Hi Martin, Is it safe to say the effort you put toward recruiting new affiliates, is the fact that the majority of affiliates in the travel industry in general simply don’t convert well? Furthermore, I’d adventure to say even major brand such as Expedia, Priceline, Travelocity, etc… are having hard time selling and retaining customers? The amusing thing’s while on Expedia you advertise hotwire’s ads as if it was a different company offering specials on your pages. Fools a lot of customers who don’t realize Expedia owns Hotwire:) I operate a 100% white label travel site, through one of your competitors for the last 3 years. My niche’s in luxury travel and I fair well in Google, even dominate major site like Expedia and other major OTA in some important keywords. To my dismay, after investing a lot on the site’s development and SEO, I came to realize that visitors are simply using my site for price comparison than leave. I blame this failure to my suppliers. As a matter of fact, I’m leaving my white label supplier because of late commissions payment up to 5 months and flat out lies. This is a major OTA that I’m talking about, simply lying to affiliates and not reporting sales accurately. As you rightfully mentioned, attracting visitors is the toughest part of the battle and failure to convert rest on white label suppliers such as Expedia and others. For the last 6 months, I have probably attracted around 50K visitors through Google searching for luxury hotels but if I were to tell anyone that I’ve only sold 6 rooms they will think that I was lying!:) My experience has thought me a lot about the travel industry, it’s a very tough and competitive market, unless you are properly funded (in the millions), you won’t succeed. I don’t know how Expedia’s affiliates perform sales volume wise but I surely can guess not very well either. Otherwise, you guys wouldn’t continuously be searching to recruit more and more affiliates. Fortunately for me, I have a great name and that helped develop other sectors of my site which’s paying off. Thus, I’m indeed becoming a service provider instead of a perpetual and unsuccessful travel affiliate:) I couldn’t agree more with this statement: “That valuation is based on the brand of the website, NOT the revenue.” Great article. Reply 3 years ago   Martin MacDonald Hi Blade, thanks for the comment (although the article is a year old I still firmly believe it all holds true). I do a lot of conversion rate analysis performing deep dives into the dropouts across the entire consumer journey throughout out affiliates websites, and you are absolutely right in thinking that having a higher than minimum price is a huge barrier to transacting – but its really just one of dozens of factors that people weigh up before making a purchase, even subconsciously. If your current supplier of hotel rooms isnt performing price wise, I suggest you look at alternates, a balanced view would be to look at ExpediaEAN inventory, alongside Priceline & Bed Banks. Having said that there is a lot of price elasticity in the market, and if your brand is strong, a minimal difference becomes utterly irrelevant. One thing I disagree with in your comment though is the need for a multi-million budget to compete – I work with dozens of affiliates that can only dream of budgets like that, yet have healthy companies on the strength of having a unique offering tailored to specific niche’s. If on the other hand your objective is to be a “general purpose” OTA, yeah, sure – you’re gonna need $$$$ to compete! 🙂 M Reply 3 years ago   Mike Crosoftsky I am so agree with you. I am tired of spending hours upon hours and dollars for making a API xml website as a Expedia hotels affiliate. And what have I earned? Nickles and dimes. If I was supposed to make a living of beeing an affiliate I would have been dead years ago. Who cares about visiting an affiliate site when the original is far more professional? Sorry, but it is a fuckin joke. Reply 3 years ago   Caleb Edwards Maybe one approach would be to do a hybrid model including both EAN inventory and more niche inventory that is negotiated directly with smaller suppliers. Does anyone know what range EAN typically pays in commissions? Is it even profitable when you truly analyze your cost-per-acquisition because even organic search traffic has a cost when you consider the cost to produce the content and build a social audience. Reply 4 years ago   Martin MacDonald Late reply sorry – but FYI plenty of people use EAN inventory alongside others, and we wouldnt have a multi billion dollar business if it wasnt profitable for affiliates 😉 regarding the range of commisions, you can check it out on the website! thanks Martin Reply 3 years ago   Don White labels for travel sites are one of the better white label options out there for affiliates. They key with any affiliate program is always traffic, and for travel it’s quality traffic, that will take action and create leads. Everyone is looking for the next best travel deal so a well defined site with seamless white label integration and good key words in the domain should be successful. Reply 4 years ago   Roger Price Don, you are right on some level. White-labels do create a good option for travelers looking for the best travel deals. However, that will work best for big publishers. For the small and medium publishers, a mechanism for sending leads is very important which must be very easy to incorporate. I have been working with Hello Travel Affiliate program for the past 1 year and they seem to fulfill that criteria. Their forms are java-script , easy to use and non-redirectable. Reply 4 years ago   Akhil Gupta Hi, I like this post and expressing true facts that Google is playing with affiliates. White labels are also a great solution to bring and retain traffic on affiliates websites. apart from that we in Hello Travel also give JS forms, where traveler fills the form and stays on the affiliates website. Therefore retaining the traffic on affiliates website. and guess what its not expensive as compared to white labels to integrate Hello Travel forms. Reply 4 years ago   Martin MacDonald Huh? How exactly is integrating your Hello Travel product cheaper than FREE white labels, provided by people like EAN (us), HotelsCombined etc.? Reply 4 years ago   Akhil Gupta I spoke with a perspective of individual affiliates, who have shortage of resources. And can’t hire tech guys on permanent basis to do complicated integrations. As in affiliate marketing, there few niche affiliates and there is a long tale of affiliates who are have a niche on specific keywords or lack of resources. You can correct me if I am wrong. Also traveller books a trip on OTA’S and in Hello Travel you just inquire, so that we send the best tour quotes and you choose the one with whom you want to book. Reply 4 years ago   Martin MacDonald Akhil – I think you are misunderstanding… White Labels are easy to integrate in a few mouse clicks, existing templates that you just add your logo or some styling if you wish. And free from almost every major online travel company. API integrations using XML/JSON etc. are more complex and require someone with development experience to integrate. One final thing in the subject, white labels are not a great way of bringing traffic to affiliate websites, if by “bring” you mean “get new traffic”. They are a great way of monetising existing traffic however. 4 years ago   M. Mr. Martin MacDonald, it’s very easy to promote EAN as the “… the perfect solution is to stop sending your valuable traffic to a merchant site to convert …” while you “convert” locally via an API. How many OTAs like Expedia have this? I can count them on my fingers. What is the quality and reliability of these APIs? What about niches ? What is the quality/reliability of the ‘tracking’ process? Cookies? Redirects? My point is this product’s culture needs to change rapidly! Ideally, ‘API first’ should be in every OTA mind targeting simple and rapid mashups, on both sides. What are all these half-baked products? On the other hand travel mashups, take pinterest-clones, don’t offer anything to OTAs to integrate and benefit from ‘unique & social’ content while trading the “conversion”. Everyone is building their own Ark while things should be much more simple! Reply 4 years ago   Martin Macdonald Hi M. Totally agree with your point, people should think API first as much as possible! Regarding the tracking, Im not entirely sure if you mean through referrals or a straight XML integration, so I will cover both: 1) straight XML integration: there is no way to book through our API currently and “lose” the transaction, the partner ID (cid) is passed with the details of the booking itself, so its 100% reliable – UNLESS the whole API system is unresponsive, and our uptime rate is something like 99.98% (dont quote me on that, Im not in the office). 2) referral type integration: (ie. you pass the visitor to a merchant site). There are multiple ways of tracking this, all of which have some flaws: a) JS redirect with cookie based tracking, benefits = easy to implement, drawbacks = not 100% accurate, ie. JS disabled on client.. b) referrer based tracking, benefits = SEO links, drawbacks = doesnt work if you are passing from http/https c) iframe tracking, easy to implement, doesnt track on some browsers with max security settings…. NOT EXPEDIA DATA (purely experience from other industries, where I was able to match up real bookings in the database to affiliate payments across a network, but I have typically seen from 97 to 98% success through referral tracking….. 100% in API tracking. Reply 4 years ago   Max Kraynov In a nutshell, the article reads “if you know how to attract quality traffic, become a service provider, not an affiliate”. It’s a questionable advice to say the least. Obviously since you represent Expedia, you have a muscle over your affiliates; that’s understandable. On the other hand, many affiliates have a muscle over their suppliers, believe it or not; they (affiliates) switch suppliers if they have poorly converting landing pages, are slow with payments, etc. Also, affiliates are more flexible and generally deliver better value to consumers when they can plug multiple suppliers and pick the most suitable for their customers – be it on the basis of price, geography, product or something else. What I fully agree with you on is that affiliates usually don’t retain any relationship with their customers, unless they build a brand. There are other ways of doing it, too. Reply 4 years ago   Martin Macdonald Hi Max, sorry – that’s not fundamentally what I’m saying, my point was more “if you know how to attract quality traffic, try and keep as much of the rest of the value chain that you can”. Pragmatically, there is zero chance that 99.999% of affiliate sites could start negotiating their own supply and so on, thats where deeper integration with affiliate platforms (yes, like EAN, but also like many other white label suppliers in a lot of verticals) can be a great value add. I don’t represent Expedia (brand sites), my position is here at Expedia Affiliate Networks which is a 100% whitelabel/full integration platform – and my core responsibility is ensuring that our partners maximise their profits. This in turn naturally has a positive impact on our business, but the point is I’m not here trying to drum up publicity for, or present a viewpoint from, Expedia’s branded businesses. The concept of delivering better value to consumers by presenting choice – totally agree! Aggregators or price comparison websites by their very nature do not lend themselves to white label solutions. To sum up: there are of course plenty of situations where it doesn’t make sense for an affiliate to have a white label solution, but right now I would hazard the guess that there are a large number of sites that would benefit from retaining control and information for the long term. Reply 4 years ago   Chris Johnson Nice article, Martin – although you do scare our userbase somewhat! 😉 I think you’ve made some valid points about the need to differentiate your affiliate offering. It’s not uncommon knowledge and a main reason why the many copywriting agencies are cropping up quite rapidly to service the need for unique content. In terms of getting hold of the conversion funnel, I think its important to note that there are many affiliates who are actually touching more points along the customer journey than ever before, on a multi-channel level too, and something we expect to continue as affiliates start digging deeper into their data, pinpointing their userbase and targeting them more specifically. As the start of the customer journey continues to increase through other platforms i.e social / mobile / video it will become more important to influence the customer journey to source traffic to affiliate websites than relying purely on the SERPS. Chris J 🙂 Reply 4 years ago   Martin Macdonald Hey Chris, thanks for the comment – and yes, I am a little prone to bouts of sensationalism! I of course agree – there are plenty of affiliates that are incredibly advanced, and understand the profiling of their customers is key. I know for instance that lots of major affiliates in gambling have gone down this route, but its not typical of the mass market. If everyone did this kind of stuff, I wouldn’t have any complaints though 🙂 Reply 4 years ago   Affiliate marketing in travel is dead [or should be] – Tnooz - Affiliate Marketing Philippines […] Tnooz […] Reply 4 years ago   dina akhmetzhanova Interesting article. It’s true affiliates need to take control. Product feeds / dynamic content can give affiliates control so they can target the products based on their visitor demographics. Agree that affiliates need to build a brand like moneysavingexpert and develop a community and not just a simple referral to the brand. Brand building is really expensive though and can take time. Smaller affiliates can do this via social marketing. Relevant and original content could help increase the organic traffic providing search engine friendly context to product information. But it would work best in combination with targeted and highly optimized ads and data feeds again could be used for that. You can find out more on our website: http://www.fusepump.com/our-services Reply 4 years ago   Oz Har Adir While your points are valid, I think there is some exaggeration in the main statements (and the title 🙂 I think that the logic for cooperation between travel brands and partners (whether they are OTA’s, Metas or anyone’s affiliates) has always been: you do the marketing, we do the servicing. Everything below this equation is details (the bigger you are the bigger your share is, the marketer (should) earn the larger share of the pie because it is increasing the pie etc) and above all: the better the product of the travel brand, the more likely an affiliate is to succeed. Better includes both commission + actual service provided to the customer. Having taken all of that of the table, Martin wants to tell us that Expedia has a new white label which is better than the competition. Thanks for the tip Martin, and more than that, thank you for innovating for affiliates, it helps improve the niche and makes our success chances better 🙂 Reply 4 years ago   Martin Macdonald Hi Oz, as for a sensationalist headline, guilty!! Its actually a bit of a meme from the SEO industry (where Ive worked for over a decade). 🙂 One thing though I must point out – I’m not really commenting on whether our whitelabel / templates / integration / conversion rates are any better than other companies. Its really a comment on the industry, where it is going, rather than a marketing piece to attract more partners to EAN. thanks for your comment! M Reply 4 years ago   Nick Vivion Great piece! For content creators like me, we truly are entering a golden age – our next hurdle is to convince more marketers to spend money on us rather than shiny new tools or slick ways to game the system. By supporting unique content creators who help fulfill a brand promise, not only will the websites be more useful to the user, but they will also be more appealing overall as an acquisition target. Reply 4 years ago   Martin Macdonald Content marketing is one of the key parts of organic search, which has to be one of the key parts of anyone’s marketing these days. I think its fairly safe to say that you guys should have a good few years coming up! Reply 4 years ago   Chicke Fitzgerald Lest we forget, the likes of American Express, AARP and AOL have long been “affiliates” of the majors and the affiliate business drives a significant amount of revenue to the OTAs (including Martin’s company). So the model is hardly dead or even drawing its last breath. There is clearly a difference between those that do nothing more than put a wrapper on the out of the box partner solutions from Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz and Priceline and those that invest in building out unique solutions utilizing the inventory and service capabilities of these companies. It would seem that Martin’s comments are about the former and not the latter. There is still a place for this collaborative approach to building out new capabilities for consumers, as it is simply not realistic for every individual travel web venture to connect to all of the various inventory sources on their own. Affiliate programs and the old fashioned approach of becoming a GDS powered travel agency remain the two primary models at play, but not the only option. The sheer availability (or lack thereof) of XML solutions by the OTAs for any product type beyond hotel is what is driving the need for new solutions, but what also drives the need for sophisticated systems integration This is where the bulk of the up front cost comes in for launching a new site. But Martin is right. Brand building, coming up with differentiated services and keeping your content fresh (and searchable) are not for the faint of heart. Reply 4 years ago   Martin Macdonald thanks Bobby! 🙂 Reply 4 years ago   Bobby Healy Great article Marin, wholeheartedly agree with your position on this. Reply 4 years ago   Chris White Label Solutions… I swear we left these back in the 90’s/early 2000’s in the box labelled ‘Never Converts’. No affiliate or content publisher in their right mind would rely on duplicated content from a white label to drive their business. Reply 4 years ago   Martin Macdonald Chris – a real “white label” solution is one where you have complete control over the conversion funnel. If its not converting its your fault 😉 If you are talking about templates used in “psuedo” white label sites (ie. ExpediaEAN’s Chameleon service) then things have moved on a bit in the last decade! Lets be honest though, those are to serve a purpose: easy integration. Nothing else. My preference would be to see everyone who is currently sending traffic to a brand, take control of the conversion by bringing it into their own site – NOT simply referring the traffic on. Reply 4 years ago   Martino Matijevic I agree with you Martin, we use a hotel white label page not because it’s got fantastic conversions but because it’s “easy integration”. Proper API/XML integration is a much more powerful solution, given the affiliate full control over the conversion process, but it takes time to implement and maintain. Btw, great article! Reply 4 years ago   Chris Bringing product conversion onto your own site for some affiliates like myself, would negate the strength of my brand and therefore the integrity of my site – some of us need to remain impartial. One size does not fit all. Conversion has never really been an issue, one of my former brands is now owned by Expedia. 😉 Reply 4 years ago   ADVERTISEMENT <a href="https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a2bfe3f0&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-widget', 'https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a2bfe3f0&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE', '');" target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=45&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a2bfe3f0' border='0' alt='' /></a> ADVERTISEMENT <a href="https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=aa0a2c91&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-widget', 'https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=aa0a2c91&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE', '');" target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=47&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=aa0a2c91' border='0' alt='' /></a> ADVERTISEMENT <a href="https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a365b2b5&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-widget', 'https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a365b2b5&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE', '');" target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=51&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a365b2b5' border='0' alt='' /></a> ADVERTISEMENT <a href="https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a9b3a1d3&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-widget', 'https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a9b3a1d3&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE', '');" target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=60&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a9b3a1d3' border='0' alt='' /></a>   <a href='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a3e1f225&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='https://www.tnooz-media.com/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=56&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a3e1f225' border='0' alt='' /></a>   Return to the top of page Articles Overview Devices Distribution Marketing Social Startups Systems Travel sectors Regions About Overview Our History Contact People Partners Advertise Overview Media pack Events Overview Calendar Thack Tnooz live Webinars   All rights reserved © 2016 tnooz Privacy Copyright Disclaimer Ethics statement Site Map   Design and development by Momentum Design Lab   Latest News Sabre lands federal board role, LeisureLink COO to drive NextPax US, and more...

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Nexus 7 2016 Edition Could Be Unveiled Next Month, Built by Huawei, Rumors Claim! Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: September 10, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» While Google’s fans expected to see news about the 2016 edition of the Nexus 7 tablet earlier this year during Google’s I/O keynote, the event went through without any such announcements. This obviously led to some disappointment, but it looks like Google are going to make up for that next month. Rumors indicate that the company is getting ready to reveal the tablet in October, and they could even make it immediately available for purchase if some of the bolder predictions turn out to be true. It’s worth keeping in mind that there is no news from Google themselves, so this could all be false in the end. But it would make sense for several reasons, the most notable one being that many experts seem to agree that Google should release a new tablet in their Nexus like during this year. The company has already missed some opportunities to solidify their presence on the tablet market, and now could be their best chance to compensate for that. Of course, that would also require a solid release. The tablet market has changed quite a bit over the last few years, and even though the original Nexus 7 and its successor were great devices, Google will have to put more effort now if they want to make the same impression. On that topic, we don’t really know what the company could be planning for the Nexus 7 2016, but we expect a top-of-the-line release with a large resolution screen, good connectivity options, and maybe even some extra innovation. VR technology has been getting more and more prominent lately, and its tie to mobile devices is interesting. Google themselves seem to have some interest in this area of the market, so maybe the company could release their tablet with some additional features in this direction, but that’s more wishful thinking rather than any analysis of the market. It seems like Asus won’t be responsible for the manufacturing of the new device this time, if some other rumors are to be believed. Rather, Google are now apparently working with Huawei, and this rumor is made even more plausible by the fact that the company reportedly has a trademark on the name “Huawei 7P”. However, it could be related to something entirely different, but we doubt Google would allow something like this to go by unnoticed and not make any comments about it. Many signs seem to point in the direction of Huawei right now, and it looks like Google’s own fans won’t mind if that’s the company behind the production of the new device. Huawei themselves seem to be hinting at a new Nexus device coming out by them this year, but it’s hard to decipher those claims more precisely right now. Plus, we would expect that Google have a tight grip on the release of information about this project, and they’re probably keeping things at a low profile if the device is real. If it is, and if the recent rumors are true, we’ll find out in just under one month when Google are rumored to make the big announcement. October could be a very interesting month for tablet lovers who’ve been looking to invest in a new device lately, as we’ve also been hearing rumors about some other noteworthy releases coming up during that time. There are only a few weeks left until we find out in any case.

This week we have a couple of potential upheavals to Google SERPs and the core algorithm, as well as updates to Knowledge Panel and a warning on spammy widgets. Google experiments with new desktop SERP layout As I reported earlier this week, in among Google’s 1,000s of minor experiments a few users were served with a rather fundamental change: a new desktop SERP layout featuring mobile-style cards. The number of results on the card-based SERP is exactly the same as the ’standard’ layout and the snippet width is significantly longer (roughly 20 extra characters). Google has experimented with this card-based layout before in 2013, and again earlier this year in May. The fact it keeps reappearing obviously means Google has seen positive use of the new layout. Google’s core algorithm saw a few minor changes Over the weekend it became clear to everyone tracking this sort of thing (SEOs mainly) that there was turbulence in Google’s algorithm. MozCast measured a ‘temperature’ on Thursday 2nd September as a sweltering 108 degrees and experts across the UK noted the following peaks in their own monitoring. I know we’re not supposed 2 trust SERP monitoring tools 4 updates but just in case I’ll just leave this here. #SEO pic.twitter.com/LcvrGZ5Cy7 — Dawn Anderson (@dawnieando) September 3, 2016 John Mueller stated in the video below (five minutes in) that the Google update was NOT Penguin 4.0, so you can “cross that one off your lists.” However there was a slightly more concrete change to the Local Pack with Google issuing a quality update which removed some spammy local results. Site reviews now appear in Google Knowledge Panels According to Google’s blog post, its new ‘Reviews from the web’ service brings aggregated user ratings of up to three review sites to Knowledge Panels for local businesses and attractions. All you have to do is implement the review snippet markup and meet Google’s criteria, and your site’s user-generated composite ratings will be eligible for inclusion.

Google would like to ‘strongly’ remind you about links contained in widgets Google does its best to penalise any sites caught manipulating PageRank with spammy links and yesterday it decided to remind webmasters about the danger of adding keyword-rich, hidden or low-quality links in widgets. Apparently some widgets (like you might add to your WordPress site) can add links to your webpages that you did not editorially place and contain anchor text that the webmaster does not control. Because they’re ‘unnatural’, they’re considered a violation of Google Webmaster Guidelines. Here are a couple of examples… Google’s webspam team may take manual actions on unnatural links. But can resolve or avoid this by making sure you add a rel=”nofollow” attribute on the widget links or remove the links/widgets entirely. Update to the layout of search ads in Google Play Google first introduced search ads to its Google Play store last year to improve app discovery and now its “fine-tuning the ads experience… to deliver even more growth for the developer community.” According to an Adwords blog post, these are the changes… For app-specific searches on Google Play, ads in their current form will not be shown at the top of the page. Instead, the organic result for the app will show at the top of the page, followed by additional organic results and possibly ads for other relevant apps. A relevant, additional ad will start to show on Google Play for some queries like “music streaming app” and “exercise app.” This new ad spot gives developers an additional opportunity to promote the apps you’ve worked so hard to build.

Chris Hall5 October 2016Phones Google Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google set the cat amongst the pigeons when it announced the Pixel C tablet in 2015. Launched alongside the two new Nexus handsets (Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P), this new tablet came Pixel branded, rather than Nexus branded.  The previous Pixel product we saw was the Chromebook Pixel, Google's high-resolution Chromebook, which has since been dropped, having reached the end of its life. Roll forward to 2016 and Google has announced the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, as it puts Nexus out to pasture. Surely these are all just Google products? What exactly is the difference between Nexus and Pixel? What is Google Pixel? The Pixel devices are those that are end-to-end designed by Google. In the Pixel C we got an Android platform device, so it's important not to assume that Pixel is going to be a Chrome OS device, which the original Chromebook Pixel was. The new Pixel C was described as a tablet that's been entirely built by Google, rather than one that's build by a partner. That was also the case with the Chromebook Pixel. So that's what Pixel is - it's a device that's completely Google. Put this into the context of the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, and Google was clear that this was all about being "Made By Google". Now, Google didn't just build a factory and start machining aluminium, this will have been done by someone else, but Pixel devices only carry Google branding, with a big G on the back of these phones. Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Release date, specs and everything you need to know What is Google Nexus? The Nexus programme is much more familiar as it gave rise to a number of smartphones and tablets over the past few years, the most recent being the 2015 launch of the Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5X, which may also mark the end of the Nexus line. The Nexus devices are built in collaboration with partners. They have partner design and input, where Pixel is purely Google's doing. We've previously seen Nexus devices from Samsung, Asus, HTC, LG and Huawei, and these devices carry the partner name as well as the Nexus branding. Pick up a Nexus 6P and you have the Huawei name on the rear. So that's what Nexus is (or was?): a device built for Google where someone else took some of the credit. RIP Nexus: A brief history of all the Nexus handsets Why does Google make Pixel products? The Chromebook Pixel set a benchmark for Chromebooks, aiming to be the best it could be - and it was fantastic. It was a premium devices, then followed by Chromebooks from other manufacturers that were affordable. In this case, the Chromebook Pixel was about being aspirational and creating a buzz around Chrome OS. The same applied to the Pixel C. This tablet was designed without compromise, and offers wonderful experiences with that keyboard, even if there were some shortcomings. Pixel C is still a showcase device for Android on a tablet with a focus on the workplace and being productive. The Pixel smartphones, however, are slightly different. These are designed as premium smartphones, but feel more like Google asserting itself and wanting a slice of the phone hardware pie that it's never really had.  Google Pixel preview: Arise my Pixel apprentice Google Pixel XL preview: A new, costly, Google overlord Sections Google Tablets Phones OnePlus 3T vs Google Pixel XL: What's the difference?

Now, a news report has revealed that the total downloads for the app has already surpassed 5 million.  This was revealed by Google CEO Sundar Pichai himself in a recent tweet. According to Indian Express, the popularity of Google Duo can be attributed to the efficiency and ease of use. Registering and signing in are a breeze, while the search giant also simplified the process of calling somebody in your contacts. There's also the fact that the app will work both on Android or iOS devices. According to the product manager for the app, the Google Duo works as well as the user's network. But there's a neat little trick in the app which automatically adjusts the video resolution if the signal is weak. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7.

By Liam Tung | September 9, 2016 -- 09:49 GMT (02:49 PDT) | Topic: Artificial Intelligence On a scale from 1 to 5, WaveNet's quality of voice outstrips Google's current best parametric and concatenative systems. Image: Google DeepMind Google's UK artificial intelligence lab, DeepMind, has developed a deep neural network that produces more human-like speech than Google's previous text-to-speech (TTS) systems. DeepMind has published a new paper describing WaveNet, a convolutional neural network it says has closed the gap between machine-generated and human speech by 50 percent in both US English and Mandarin Chinese. Not only this, but the network can also seamlessly switch between different voices and generate realistic music fragments. The researchers note that today's best TTS systems, generally considered to be powered by Google, are built on "speech fragments" recorded from a single speaker. Those fragments are then reconstructed to create utterances. While this approach, known as concatenative TTS, has produced natural-sounding speech, it is generally limited to a single voice unless a new database is provided. Another technique called parametric TTS, which relies on voice codec synthesizers, may be more flexible, but this hasn't achieved as natural-sounding speech. WaveNet differs by being trained on raw audio waveform from multiple speakers and then using the network to model these signals to generate synthetic utterances. Each sample it creates is fed back into the network to generate another sample. "As well as yielding more natural-sounding speech, using raw waveforms means that WaveNet can model any kind of audio, including music," DeepMind researchers note in a blogpost. WaveNet is also capable of learning the characteristics of multiple voices, from both male and female speakers, including breathing and mouth movements. The company provides samples in the post in which WaveNet can be heard saying the same thing in several different voices, both in English and Mandarin. "To make sure [WaveNet] knew which voice to use for any given utterance, we conditioned the network on the identity of the speaker. Interestingly, we found that training on many speakers made it better at modelling a single speaker than training on that speaker alone, suggesting a form of transfer learning," the researchers note. One factor that may limit WaveNet's application to Google's products is that the approach requires vast amounts of data and computing power. According to DeepMind, modelling raw audio typically requires the processing of at least 16,000 samples per second, but this approach was necessary to create realistic speech sounds. DeepMind also said WaveNet can easily be reapplied to music audio modelling and speech recognition.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Photos on iOS brings Motion Stills magic to Live Photos JC Torres - Sep 9, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Last June, Google introduced the (strangely) iOS-only Motion Stills app that brought some stability to the otherwise mostly shaky Live Photos feature on Apple’s platform. While it did create some fascinating GIFs, it had one major flaw. It was a different, somewhat obscure app that users had to first know about before they could install. Google has now addressed that issue, ironically killing Motion Stills in the process. Yes, Google Photos has been updated to bake that feature into the app itself. Presuming, of course, you also have it installed in the first place. Like many of Google’s more recent apps, Motion Stills started out more as a proof of concept. Or rather, boast of concept. It demonstrated Google’s computer imaging prowess in how it is able to analyze a Live Photo, determine which is the background, and then freeze that background while the foreground, usually people or moving objects, move as normal. The effect is almost like a timelapse near impossible to do normally with Live Photos. Google is now putting that technology right into its Google Photos app. Why bother when there’s already an app for that, you might ask. For one, “Google Photos” has a better chance of being discovered and installed compared to a very generic one like “Motion Stills”. For another, if users already have Google Photos installed, they won’t have to install yet another app just to get this feature. It would, of course, be even better if it integrated with the iOS Photos app itself, but that’s never going to happen. At least until Apple decides to implement a similar feature. Besides, it neatly ties into Google’s mission to have users store their photos on Google’s cloud instead. And for those a bit peeved that Google has once again prioritized a rival’s platform, worry not. Google promises that the feature will soon land on Google Photos everywhere, both on the web and on Android.

Image copyright: Swapnil Bhartiya Creative Commons Attribution Swapnil Bhartiya Engineer Marc Merlin has been working at Google since 2001 but has been involved with Linux since 1993, in its very early days. Since then, open source adoption has dramatically increased, but a new challenge is emerging: Not many companies care about the license side of open source, Merlin stated in his talk “How Google Uses and Contributes to Open Source” at LinuxCon and ContainerCon North America. “There are companies and people who just take the software and say, “I didn't have to pay for it. I can do anything I want. The license file is a big blob of text. I'm not going to read that," Merlin said. “If you get software that you didn't have to pay for and you get a license with it that gives you a few things that you should be doing, then you should be respecting the license,” Merlin said. Respect the license In some cases, companies aren’t aware that their products contain open source code, or they’re not informed about how to comply with open source licenses. Although some companies are well informed about the licenses, they choose not to care for many reasons: They move to the next product, they are too small to be sued, or they are in a country where they can do whatever they want. Regardless of the reasons companies don’t comply, license compliance is a complicated, but extremely important, issue. Google didn’t always get it right when it came to open source management, Merlin said, but their practices provide lessons that can benefit any company that needs to improve their open source compliance. Evolution of open source at Google Merlin said that he has moved many times within Google, because he gets bored. What he ends up doing is helping teams make sure that they do the right thing when it comes to using and contributing to open source. Back in its early days, around 1998, Google was a small company. It was using open source just like any other small company. While Google was abiding by licences, they were not giving back much due to several reasons. “Some of it was just run fast and make sure that we have money next month to pay everyone's salary,” said Merlin. Another fact was that Google was using very old versions of Linux. They had it frozen and whatever changes they were making were irrelevant to the current version of Linux, which was far ahead of what they were using. In 2004, Chris DiBona joined Google to run the Open Source Program Office. “The whole point of the office is to help the company do the right thing, help engineers with their questions, and to make sure everyone plays by the rules,” said Merlin. How you develop affects contributions Google was working on so many different projects back then that it was -- and still is -- iterating fast. “When you go fast, you just patch the source and move on to the next problem because things are on fire. It was difficult to get the patches part of it and contribute them,” said Merlin. There was no Git back then; those were CVS days, which made it even harder to keep track of source code. In addition to using really old code, another problem was that most of what Google was working on internally was not designed to be open source at that time. There are very large internal libraries on which other projects depend. That made it hard to open source new things because you can’t just take one piece of it and open source it. Go open source from the beginning Google changed that by writing a lot of things from the ground up as open source or to be open source ready. That was a good lesson that they learned, and that’s a problem many companies face when they want to open source their stuff but can’t because the code was not designed to be open source from the beginning. Even if Google can’t open source certain code, they found a way to bring that work to the public. “We wrote papers talking about the magic algorithm that we used. We can't give you the code for the reason I just explained, but we're giving you the way they work so you can rewrite them,” said Merlin. Google has published hundreds of such papers and people are using it to create projects based on those ideas. Due to all these efforts, Google is today among the top 10 contributors to the Linux kernel. Google has hired many kernel developers and open source leaders, such as Andrew Morton, Theodore T’so, and Jeremy Allison who don’t do any work for Google; they work directly on Linux or their own projects. In addition, Google also has a team of kernel developers who write code for Google’s own needs. Open source projects Chrome and Android may be the biggest open source projects at Google, but there are several more open source projects. Google also encourages people to contribute to open source on their own time. Although many employer agreements define ownership of code written by their employees when it is in the same line of business, even on their own time, Google has a process where employees can get for ownership of code they wrote on their own time and hardware. Merlin said that Google has set up a process whereby the company can disclaim that code and give it back to that employee, or Google can just approve and release that without having to go through the company. Google is also encouraging employees to use their Google email so that their contributions are more visible. Google has internal bonus programs for employees to encourage them when they do something good, and people thought the company should do something similar for open source. “We now have an internal program where we can nominate open source projects that may be one or two people -- not a huge group -- and could benefit from having a bit of extra hardware or extra money,” Merlin said. Open source licenses Licenses play a critical role when companies like Google choose to contribute to projects. Just because a project is open source doesn't mean Google employees can freely contribute to it. “There are open source licenses that are problematic,” said Merlin. “There are some licenses that are not probably not legal licenses at all, at least in some countries.” In such cases, employees are asked not to work on that as employees. “If they insist on working on that project, we give them the right. We disclaim all their work and say ‘that’s not Google work, this is you as a person’. And then they do what they want with that project.” There are cases where projects don’t have any licenses. “Sometimes we have to contact the project owners and tell them that their project doesn’t have a license. We'd like to contribute to it, but until you do, we can’t.” That helps those projects fix licenses and allows Google employees to contribute to such projects. Patch submission is a tricky area, too. If the code is on GitHub, then that’s easy, but patch submission through email needs extra work. “We like to know what’s the project. What license that project is, we have a quick look at it and we'll just tell them if it’s OK or not OK to contribute to that project,” said Merlin. Other ways Google gives back Code contribution is not the only way Google is giving back. The company sponsors many open source and Linux-related events. It also sponsors organizations like Free Software Foundation and Software Freedom Conservancy and projects like OpenSSL. At the same time, Google also gives back by creating platforms when needed; Code@Google is a good example. When Google saw that SourceForge was becoming questionable, they set up code.google.com to give a platform to developers until GitHub popped up and became the new de facto platform for open source development. Now virtually all of Google’s open source code is on GitHub, except for Android. “The Android distribution is so big and it gets released in big chunks. So, when it gets released, everyone wants to sync that,” Merlin said. “It’s so huge that if we put it on GitHub, it would completely kill GitHub. We use our own mirrors for that, to help out.” Google also runs programs that expose students to open source, they also try to encourage more women to get into the field. Then, there is Google Summer of Code for students. “Instead of going to work for McDonald's in the summer to make money, which would be a waste of their brain power, we basically take submissions for them to work on open source projects,” said Merlin. “They get a mentor. If they do well, they get a stipend to pay for their time and allow them to work and pay their college bills, whatever that summer job money was going to be for.” Dealing with licenses Companies have to be extremely careful when using open source. Different projects use different licenses, and you need to be in compliance with them. To ensure that people don’t make mistakes, “we have an internal policy that you cannot use any open source at Google, unless it goes in a separate, third party hierarchy, and each of them has directories with the license of each project,” Merlin said. So, when you include your library, you know what license it is and you can easily check that. You can’t use open source if you do not follow that process. You cannot take code and paste it.” Things become complicated when you have projects that you ship. In the case of open source, you need to list the projects that you use and their licenses. In the case of BSD and MIT, you need to list the name and the copyright of the person you got that project from. That can be a bit annoying, he said, as “you actually have to go and find every project, scan their license, find their name or the copyright line, and credit them. Otherwise, we're not compliant with the BSD or MIT license.” Google has to be extremely careful when they buy a company. They may not have their code in compliance. Merlin said sometimes Google actually passes on companies because they're totally not compliant, and to bring them into compliance is not going to be possible. What license does Google prefer? Google uses Apache 2 by default. “The main reason is that it offers a patent license to the user. If you get code from us, under Apache 2, that means you get a grant to any patent that applies to the code that you just got from us,” said Merlin. That’s not true of GPLv2, though GPLv3 now does add a patent grant. However,  GPLv3 has added a clause that prevents device manufacturers from restructuring reflashing devices, which is not an ideal solution for some companies. Merlin mentioned that they can’t contribute to WTFPL licenses, and sometimes projects don’t change the license but are willing to dual license and although it’s not ideal it’s good enough for contribution. But, he also warned that dual licenses also can be trouble and suggested avoiding them. “Once you receive a patch, it’s unclear under which license that patch is received or if it's under both licenses.” Talking about even freer licenses, Merlin said that while CC Zero is a proper license, it requires you to give up all your rights to the code to which you just contributed. What about CLAs? Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) themselves don’t mean anything; they are just legal agreements. There can be very bad legal agreements that you should never sign, or it may be completely safe. The problem is that you have to review CLAs on a case-by-case basis. Google uses the Apache foundation ICLA, without modifying it or putting anything special in it. CLAs ensure that companies like Google “can re-license your code under a different open source (license) if we need to. Sometimes we need to merge with other projects and that's what the CLA allows us to do,” said Merlin. Google employees are not allowed to sign a CLA for another company before it has been reviewed. Merlin said that most projects would be better off using Apache CLA. He shared an example of a project that he once contributed to and then the project decided to re-license it and they had to contact every single person who ever contributed a patch. Those people had to print a form, sign it, and fax it back within 10 days. It was a huge amount of wasted effort for them. Apache CLA takes care of it and makes your project future proof. Merlin also warned about not using AGPL, as no one knows where it stops; it’s just way too broad, he said. Conclusion Merlin’s description of Google’s open source story highlighted how meticulous is the process needs to be to get open source right.  The best part is that all these changes and motivations came from within the company. Through their efforts, they became one of the top contributors to Linux and created two dominant Linux-based operating systems in the consumer space. That’s a good open source story. Google it!

Their legacy mobile web apps have popups suggesting you install the Android app, even if you are using Ubuntu Phone for example, i.e. a Linux mobile device that is not their own Android one. Sure they contribute to opensource, on which their infrastructure depends. The open web made them rich, but now they are turning their back on the mobile web, to rather promote Android apps, which only run on Android - like Windows apps only run on Windows.

So how would a President Trump have handled the European Union's demand that Apple pay Ireland some $14.5 billion (plus interest!), ruling the company had received illegal state aid? You'd think Trump's reaction would be fierce, especially since the Apple spat is only the latest conflict between European officials and America's technology giants. Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft have all entered the EU's crosshairs on issues such as tax, privacy, regulation, and anti-trust. Now, we don't know exactly what Trump would do. But we do know at least one thing he wouldn't do: Launch retaliatory tax claims or tariffs against Europe's tech behemoths. Why not? Simple: There just isn't a bevy of European tech giants to go after. Forbes annually ranks the world's largest companies based on revenue, profit, assets, and market value. In its 2016 compilation, seven of the top 10 tech companies in the world were American. Europe has just just three companies in the top 20: Germany's SAP, Sweden's Ericsson, and Finland's Nokia. And there's a simply massive size difference between America's top tech firms and Europe's. For instance: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon each have a market cap of over $350 billion each. Europe's tech trio: about $50 billion a pop. There's a similarly huge disparity when it comes to fast-growing tech startups with high valuations. A 2015 study from a U.K. investment bank found that the cumulative value of all European unicorns (a startup valued at $1 billion or more) created since 2000 was around $120 billion. By comparison, Facebook has a market capitalization near $400 billion, while Uber and Airbnb, still private, are valued at $60 billion and $30 billion, respectively. America's startup success can also been seen in its ability to create many, many more entrepreneur billionaires than any other large, rich economy. Rather than attacking American tech, maybe Europe should focus more on understanding its secrets of success, as well as its own failures. Venture capitalist Michael Mortiz of Sequoia Capital likely spoke for many in Silicon Valley when he wrote in a recent op-ed: Over the past five years, the eight most valuable technology companies developed in Europe have assembled a combined market value of around $32 billion. That's not a figure to be sneezed at any more than the admirable young European technology entrepreneurs who, despite all odds, are more inclined to take a risk than members of their parents' generation. But EU legislators should be wondering why Europe's eight most valuable companies are only worth about 10 percent of Facebook or 6 percent of Google. [Financial Times] Europe is wealthy and well educated, certainly more so than China, which has the same number of tech firms on the Forbes list. So what's its problem? There are a few obvious answers: lack of access to venture capital, inflexible labor markets, and a heterogeneous home market of distinct language, cultures, and regulations. One French tech entrepreneur has described America's edge this way: "The confluence of a large pool of capital, world-class talent, vibrant support infrastructure, and a risk-loving culture has bred a self-fulfilling cycle of innovation and entrepreneurship." Don't skip over that bit about culture. A European Commission study found Europeans more skeptical of entrepreneurship than Americans, and possessing a higher level of uncertainty avoidance. The churn of American society — companies starting and dying, workers switching firms — is also key to America's innovative capacity. In a new analysis, San Francisco Federal Reserve economist John Fernald notes that America's "economic fluidity and dynamism" helps spread ideas throughout the private sector. It's why Europe invested a lot in computers in the 1990s but never got a tech boom that boosted productivity, Fernald explains. That's the real challenge for the next American president: Making sure policy is supportive of an ecology — taxes, trade, regulation, intellectual property — that promotes dynamism and churn. It must guarantee the U.S economy remains open to competition, whether from within or from abroad. That's a big part of what this election should be about.

Now the feature is available for Google Photos with the major version 2.0 update. The app got live photos support earlier this year. Google already said that new Motion Stills algorithm “uses linear programming to compute a virtual camera path that is optimized to recast videos and bursts as if they were filmed using stabilization equipment, yielding a still background or creating cinematic pans to remove shakiness.” Once created, you can easily save it as a looping video and share it with anyone.

Pocket-lint Sections Apps Cameras Cars Drones Fitness Trackers Gadgets Games Headphones Laptops Parenting Phones Smart Home Smartwatches Speakers Tablets TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards Android 7.1 Nougat review: Subtle but super-sweet OS update Cam Bunton8 November 2016Phones Pocket-lint 0.0 stars free update For Smoother and faster, better battery performance, more intelligent notifications, native split-screen Against Split-screen could offer inter-app controls Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Android 7.1 Nougat is the latest version of Google's mobile operating system. It makes its debut on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, the company’s first home-made phones, and will soon make its way to other devices. While the pre-Pixel version of Nougat was a fairly subtle update from Android Marshmallow, when it comes to noticeable user interface changes, Android 7.1 changes a lot. So, does version 7.1 turn Android into a sticky mess, or is it sweet refinement all the way? Android 7.1 Nougat review: Sweet tweaks New round icons Snappy quick-action shortcuts Notification redesign and quick reply Settings menu revamped Unlike Android 7.0 Nougat, 7.1 has introduced a notable visual change to the operating system, meaning there's definitely enough to please those who like new things. The most obvious change in design is in seen on the Pixel’s home screen, which is now littered with round icons, not square or freeform ones. This is about more than just changing for change’s sake. First and foremost, when developers follow suit, it’ll mean that all app icons have a uniform design and size. You won’t need to install something like Nova Launcher just to get all your app icons to be the same size. Secondly, it’s impossible to confuse with iOS, and differentiates it from all the third party Android skins out there. Unless you have a third party launcher and round icon packs installed on your device, this looks different. Another big change, at least in the Google Pixel's launcher, is that the app drawer is no longer accessed by tapping a dedicated icon on the screen. Instead, you pull it upwards from the app dock which - because the app drawer icon is no longer there - has space for a fifth app. Google Pixel exclusive features explored: A cut above the rest of Android? Google Pixel tips and tricks: Getting to grips with Google's phone It's also worth noting that some of these app icons have built in shortcuts, so you can tap and hold them and bring up various quick actions. Maps has the ability to quickly navigate home, messenger lets you get straight to your frequent conversation and camera lets you take a selfie. Of course, there are more than just those.  Pocket-lint A major change from Android 6.0 is also seen when notifications pop-up on screen. Where Marshmallow had cards on screen that sort-of floated on top of everything and had drop shadows, Nougat's cards spread across the entire screen. There's still a clear element of what Google calls "Material Design", but the cards feel more part of the existing screen, rather than being an attention-hogging card that just pops up awkwardly into an empty space. More importantly, all the animations in Nougat - like swiping away cards, or down from the top of the screen - feel more fluid and smooth. It's particularly noticeable when dropping down the Quick Settings options from the top, when the quick toggles all work their way in to position. On the subject of the Quick Settings drop-down menu, Nougat adds the ability to edit, rearrange and add to the visible tiles. While Marshmallow sort-of allowed this through some fiddly process and a downloadable app, Nougat has it built-in as standard. Pocket-lint We found it very helpful to only have the tiles we wanted to see in the drop-down screen, and in the order we wanted to see them. No more hunting around for an option that isn't there, or getting frustrated because it's full of settings and options that you never use. The Settings screen has had a bit of a makeover too. As a Google Pixel owner, your settings menu is split in two. The right side is a dedicated hub for device support. You can call or chat with a dedicated support team if you're needing help with your phone. With its smart suggestions at the top of the main settings menu list, it's easy to see when you have features like Do Not Disturb or Data Saver switched on. The space is also utilised to give you suggestions on any settings you may want to take a look at, but haven't yet. Google Pixel XL vs Pixel: Which should you choose? Apple iPhone to Google Pixel: How to transfer contacts, messages, calendars and media For the first time it also has a sidebar menu for when you've gone to a secondary settings screen but want to quickly jump to another main category. Dig into the settings and you'll find another new addition: the ability to adjust the size of content on the screen. The display size option in the display settings menu has a slider which adjusts the size of everything you see on screen. That means app icons, conversation bubbles in Messenger and even the settings menu itself change to allow more or less space. It's similar to adjusting a computer display's resolution and making things appear magnified. That, combined with the ability to change font size, ensures you have the setup that you like. You're no longer left with a one-size fits-all scenario. Android 7.1 Nougat review: Split-screen multitasking Have two apps running on the same screen Works in landscape and portrait While manufacturers including Samsung and LG have added split-screen multi-tasking into their re-skins of Android for a little while now, Google has never built the feature into Android itself. Nougat changes that. Android Nougat allows you run two windows side-by-side on the same screen. It's activated, and deactivated, simply by pressing-and-holding the recent apps button. We find it very useful, particularly on larger screens - although full-screen apps, such as games, are exempt, with only compatible apps part of this Nougat party. Pocket-lint However, using split-screen is something of a learning curve if you're not used to it. With years of switching between apps by simply heading to recent apps, picking one, and switching back and forth, it takes time to remember this new feature. Like anything, building that way of working in to a habitual pattern takes repetition, over days. Plus, Android N has also improved on the "old" method of switching between apps: you can switch instantly between your most recent apps just by double-tapping the recent apps key, which is great. Android 7.0 Nougat tips and tricks: Get your teeth into Google’s gooey goodness Android N Nougat: How to enable and use split-screen mode Once split-screen use becomes a habit, though, it's a very useful one. Whether you're reading something and want to share a phrase with a friend, or you want to quickly look up an address in Google Maps while keeping the written address on the screen in Notepad, it can be convenient. That said, it still feels a little cramped on smartphones, regardless of size. And unlike Samsung's Note devices, which offer sharing directly between some apps, Android N is restricted to viewing the apps individually without any direct interaction. It's clear split-screen is aimed predominantly at tablets, where multi-tasking is much more essential, especially if you're looking at buying a tablet to replace a laptop. Although many manufacturers that make Android-based laptop-like devices already add their own adjustments, such as taskbars and multi-screen options - the new Lenovo Yoga Book being one example. Android 7.1 Nougat review: Google Assistant Chat-like interface Can answer most questions and remembers context Adapts to you the more you use it In years gone by, Google has included its smart, intuitive assistant in Android. Called Google Now, it would filter your email and bring you up to date notifications for expected flights and parcels, tell you what calendar appointments you have coming up and keep you up to date on weather and anything else you're interested in. You could also ask it questions using your voice, and it could either tell you the answer directly, or point you towards a web search. Pocket-lint With 7.1 in the Pixel, Google Now has been replaced by Google Assistant. A smarter, learning version of Google Now in a chat interface. Pressing and holding the home button launches a chat with Assistant, and you can ask it much of what you asked Google Now. If you want to, you can play games with it, including a fun and pointless trivia game. Just say "Ok Google, I'm feeling lucky", and you're transported in to a glorious five-round quiz. It learns as you use it, and you can use it to book tables at restaurants, find specific photos from your gallery, set reminders, add calendar events, and so on. It's pretty smart, and undoubtedly one of the better digital assistants out there. Android 7.1 Nougat review: Notifications Set app notification priority Quick reply from any supported app Expand multiple threads from the same app We've touched on notifications already, but only from a design perspective. As well as changing visually, their functionality has been further improved too. Notifications from the same app now all group together in a cluster that can be opened up like a conversation thread. With so many apps demanding attention with constant ringing and pinging, it's about time we got more fine-tuned control over when they should alert, and which apps are the most important. Android N lets you set a priority level for any app's notifications. This requires a little digging in to settings, but it can be achieved. It's similar to the app permissions you'll find in Huawei's EMUI, again with a bit of digging. On a more basic level, when you press-and-hold a notification, you can silence all future alerts from that app. This can be particularly useful when you're sick of an game demanding that you come back and play, or any other app that continues to send endless streams of notifications through which you don't want. Android 7.1 Nougat review: Battery enhancements Doze mode now works when you're carrying the phone Battery saver keeps power consumption down in use Android Marshmallow introduced Doze in 2015, which helps devices conserve battery life when not in use and lying still on a surface of some kind for a given period of time. It's like letting the phone go to sleep, without needing to intervene - and it means exemplary standby battery performance. Pocket-lint In Android Nougat, that's been improved upon further with "Doze on the Go", which kicks the battery optimisations into gear even when the phone is moving around in a pocket. In short: if you're not using your phone, it's not going to use much of your battery - and certainly less than it did before. For devices like our Nexus 6 (which we've used to test out Nougat), that means it soon turns into a device which can last a full day on a single charge without breaking a sweat. And that's an improvement over where it used to be. Android 7.1 Nougat review: Pixel camera New slow motion feature Quickly change white balance Add a grid to the screen easily As well as some other features currently exclusive to the Pixel phones, there's the enhanced camera app. While it looks virtually identical to the app found in stock Android 7.0, it does have some added features. Running along the top of the screen are a number of different toggles that give you access to a few manual controls. You can add grid lines to help framing your photos, select a white balance preset, activate HDR+, change the flash option and set a timer. It may not be quite as granular or capable of fine-tuning as camera apps from the likes of Huawei, LG and Samsung, but it's a good selection of the basics. Within the camera settings menu you'll find the usual selection of shooting options, including panorama, photo sphere and lens blur. The one major difference this time is that there's a new slow motion option, which records in either 120 or 240 frames per second. Android 7.1 Nougat review: Software updates and Direct Boot "Optimising apps" screen is gone Software updates in the background One of the things that you may have noticed (and been excruciatingly frustrated with) in older versions of Android is that whenever your software receives an update, regardless of how small, you spend ages waiting for all the apps to be "optimised". With Android Nougat, that is no more. Software doesn't just download and update seamlessly in the background, it also boots up almost instantly when your phone restarts. There's no more "your apps are optimising" screen, just power up and go. Yay. Verdict Android 7.1 Nougat may not be the biggest operating system update we've ever seen, but a lot of the changes and improvements are greatly appreciated and improve upon key areas: battery life, notifications control and seamless updates. If we had to pick out any negatives, we would like to see more customisation options visually, reducing the need for third-party launchers. Even if just to allow you to choose the number of app rows and columns are in the app drawer or on the home screen, that would be a start. The return of a system-wide dark mode (which we saw in an early developer preview) would be great too. All in all, Nougat is a great update. But, arguably, the two biggest features are those we cannot yet see: firstly, Google opened it up super early to manufacturers to help them get updates out sooner; secondly, there's DaydreamVR which is built-in but - since no phones support it yet - we haven't been able to test it, nor see how good the results of the Vulkan API graphics rendering tool are. But just because you can't see all the goodness, doesn't mean there aren't plenty of sweet extras here. Nougat cleans up some of Marshmallow's underbaked gaps to make for the best and longest-lasting Android experience yet. The most painful point about it might be waiting for your handset to offer the update. Sections Phones OnePlus 3T vs Google Pixel XL: What's the difference?

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Social Google introduces ‘Reviews from the web’; will show it in search Google introduces ‘Reviews from the web’; will show it in search Google has announced 'Review from the web' feature for businesses, which will show user-generated reviews in results. By: Tech Desk | Published:September 9, 2016 2:15 pm Google Reviews from the Web will bring together user reviews from across websites into the search results. Google has announced ‘Review from the web’ feature for businesses, which will show user-generated reviews, along with reviews by critics directly in the search results. According to a blog post, Google will be adding this “Reviews from the web” to local Knowledge Panels, in addition to the “best-of lists and critic reviews features.” Google’s post says, “Whether your site publishes editorial critic reviews, best-of places lists, or aggregates user ratings, this content can be featured in local Knowledge Panels when users are looking for places to go.” The feature will go live on mobile and desktop across the world, and it will bring “aggregated user ratings of up to three review sites to Knowledge Panels.” This will apply to places like a restaurant, parks, amusement parks, shops, etc. According to Google, webmasters who allow the review snippet and meet their criteria, will see their site’s “user-generated composite ratings will be eligible for inclusion.” So any local business which is listed on Google and is reviewed on other websites, might see the ‘user generated reviews’ and aggregate ratings also show on the panel on the right in the search results card. For instance, if you search for a restaurant, which is reviewed on Facebook or Zomato by regular users, etc; now on Google, these user reviews will also show in the Google Search card, which gives details on the restaurant. In the US, Google says “qualifying publishers can participate in the critic review feature in local Knowledge Panels.” Critic’s reviews are those with an editorial tone, more opinionated, and usually coming from an expert, says Google. Google’s latest step will boost how people get results on the website, and with user reviews showing directly in the search page reduces the need to go to the actual website to find the average rating for a place. Google’s Knowledge Graph and panels on the right-hand side have become more information-rich over time, and the addition of user-reviews in another such step.

Image credit: Dave Keegan The secret media agency kickback scandal that rocked the US digital marketing industry in the last year is, in fact, commonplace among European media owners, including display networks, because it is not illegal here, Wolfgang Digital CEO Alan Coleman told Siliconrepublic.com. The murky practice of secret rebates or kickbacks, where agencies are motivated to spend online ad budgets in a way that derives the most profit for themselves rather than clients, was exposed as being on the rise in the US in the past year. In some cases in the US, media agencies would route $200,000 of a client’s $1m digital ad budget back to the agency’s corporate sibling in Europe, according to a report in AdAge last year. ‘The obvious issue with secret rebates is agencies are motivated to spend a client’s advertising budget with the most profitable channel for the agency rather than the most effective channel for the advertiser’ – ALAN COLEMAN, WOLFGANG DIGITAL A new study by Dublin-based Wolfgang Digital pointed to an over-indexing of display ads as a problem across the digital marketing and e-commerce industries, and to digital marketers faced by too much data focusing on irrelevant metrics like bounce rates. Coleman said that display accounts for a third of digital marketing budgets. And yet, he said, display doesn’t register as a top 10 traffic source. Kickbacks distort digital marketing in Europe He said that social networks and search engines don’t pay agencies “agency rates”, while display networks do, and warned that the secret agency rebates scandal raging in the US will be an issue very soon in Europe. Coleman told Siliconrepublic.com: “In the US, it is illegal for an agency to get a rebate from a media owner that is not disclosed to the advertiser it is buying media on behalf of. It has emerged that secret rebates are common practice in the US. “The obvious issue with secret rebates is that agencies are motivated to spend a client’s advertising budget with the most profitable channel for the agency rather than the most effective channel for the advertiser. “However, secret rebates are not illegal in Europe, nor are they illegal in Ireland. The internet media giants – Google, Facebook and Twitter etc. – simply don’t pay rebates. But they are commonplace among other media owners, display included. The study highlights a massive over-indexing on display advertising spend compared to measurable results in traffic and revenue from display.” Which online platforms deliver the best bang per buck? In Wolfgang Digital’s benchmark key performance indicator (KPI) report for e-commerce websites, which analysed 87m e-commerce website sessions and €230m online revenue among sites like Littlewoods, Harvey Norman, Lifestyle Sports and Guinness Storehouse, it was found that Google still makes the world go round. According to the study, Google delivers over two-thirds of website traffic (69pc) and website revenue (67pc). Despite this, 38pc of digital marketer’s budgets fail to display Google as a top 10 traffic source. The study found that bounce rates have zero correlation with conversion rates. “As an overall website metric, it’s a dud,” said Coleman. Wolfgang Digital CEO Alan Coleman. Image credit: Dave Keegan ‘The sturdy email is quietly kicking ass. It delivers more traffic than all the social channels combined and trebles them for revenue’ – ALAN COLEMAN, WOLFGANG DIGITAL The study revealed that Facebook web traffic quantity has risen rapidly from 1.3pc two years ago to 5pc today. Mobile is now the largest traffic source, but seriously underperforms for revenue. Its 42pc share of traffic becomes a miserly 21pc share of revenue, and it suffers the lowest average conversion rate and average order value (AOV). The Wolfgang Digital study also shows that site speed really matters. For every 0.2 seconds a website can shave off its server response time, it can expect an 8pc improvement in conversion rate. Asked about the most common mistakes European e-commerce companies are making, Coleman said that people are focusing on the wrong data. “If people start with the wrong KPIs in mind, they are setting themselves up for a fall. “Sometimes people get caught up optimising for vanity keywords that won’t deliver commercially. For example, ‘dresses’ when they could be high-end clothing retailers and those searching for dresses may not be in that market. This is often at the behest of a senior board member. “Another mistake is to focus on improving two metrics with an inverse relationship – it’s very hard to make both improve simultaneously. A good example highlighted in the study is AOV and conversion rate. Typically, one goes up when the other goes down. “Sometimes, we have conversations with people who are upset with a high bounce rate and they want to improve it. As the study shows, bounce rate is a dud metric. If you do improve it you will see no uplift in conversion.” Google is the winner, but Facebook is a rising star In terms of the platforms that deliver effective returns online, Coleman says that Google is still the clear winner. “If you win on Google, you win online. This cannot be overstated. Google delivers over two-thirds of traffic and revenue. The strongest correlation we found with high conversion rates is a high proportion of Google AdWords traffic. The strongest correlation we found with high average order value is a high proportion of Google organic traffic. “Facebook is the study’s rising star, quadrupling its share of traffic from 1.3pc in 2014 to 5pc today. There’s a lot more traffic available for canny marketers from Facebook than they might be aware of.” But the dark horse is, believe it or not, email. “The sturdy email is quietly kicking ass. It delivers more traffic than all the social channels combined and trebles them for revenue. Although we lust after shiny new things, digital marketers will be rewarded for paying attention to the old reliables. “Developing an extensive email list delivers value beyond the sending of emails itself. Both Facebook and Google now allow advertisers to upload email addresses and target those people with specific campaigns. We’ve seen plenty of success with imaginative email targeted campaigns,” Coleman said.

Daydream VR ready Manufacturer: Google Review Price: £599.99 What is the Google Pixel? The Google Pixel is a landmark device, signalling the first proper foray into phones by the search engine giant. And boy, has it done a good job. The Pixel is available in two sizes – the smaller one reviewed here and a larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL – and has one of the best cameras on any phone, along with a software experience that's better than any other Android device. You have to pay a premium for these features – this certainly isn’t a Nexus-priced device – but it’s far from the first phone to cost a pretty penny. And when it’s this good, it’s worth paying that bit extra. Related: Our review of Daydream View – the best mobile VR headset? Google Pixel – Design The least exciting part about the whole idea of the Google Pixel is its design. I know many people who dislike it completely, but I find it perfectly serviceable. It isn't as flashy as Samsung’s Galaxy S7, but it's much nicer than than the latest batch of iPhones. The body is made from metal and glass – pretty much a given these days – and it tapers down ever so slightly on the rear to help avoid any unnecessary camera bumps. A circular fingerprint sensor sits below the camera sensor, and both are encased in a divisive glass panel that runs about a third of the way down the back. Some in the TrustedReviews' office hate it, but I think it adds some flair, catching the light nicely. It is a fingerprint magnet and scratches very easily, however. Related: iPhone vs Pixel Google Pixel and Pixel XL video review Unlike Apple, Google includes a 3.5mm headphone jack – but I’d have preferred for it to have been placed at the bottom rather than the top of the phone. In addition, Google has used a wide bezel above and below the screen – just like the iPhone. It would have been good to see this space used for a pair of front-facing speakers – maybe this will come with the Pixel 2. The sides are heavily chamfered, and this helps the device to fit comfortably in your hand. This is one of the easiest phones to hold, helped by the fact it isn’t overly thin. It’s also completely usable in one hand, something that can’t be said for the larger Pixel XL. It’s roughly the same size as an iPhone 7, just a little taller and marginally thicker. Google Pixel – Display 5-inch displays are becoming a rarity in the Android space, but for many they provide the perfect mix of portability and size. However, the problem – aside from the dearth of choice – is that smaller phones tend to be hamstrung by weak components and a lack of features. Thankfully, this isn’t the case here. This is a 5-inch display phone with the innards of a larger device – and that’s great news. The Pixel's display is fantastic, comfortably one of the best at this size. It’s an AMOLED panel – the same tech Samsung uses on its Galaxy series – with a 1080p resolution. This isn't as high as the larger Pixel XL and its quad-HD panel, but due to its smaller size you really won’t notice the difference. It’s pin-sharp with zero jagged edges around icons when you’re looking at it from a normal distance. Get right up close, with your eye almost touching the screen, and you might notice a tiny bit of pixellation around the battery icons and on-screen buttons. Realistically, though, you won't be using the phone from such a distance. Buy Now: Google Pixel at Amazon.com from $880 Best Deals for Google Pixel Compare plans I only question Google's decision to use a 1080p panel here when it comes to VR. With the upcoming Daydream View headset using the phone display, the experience might be worse on the Pixel's lower-resolution screen as opposed to the Pixel XL. I haven’t had the opportunity to use them together yet, so will keep my thoughts open until I do. Related: What is Daydream View? Everything else about the screen is great. Since it's AMOLED, there’s a lovely kick to the colours, yet saturation looks accurate. Often these display types overblow reds and greens, but they look fine here. Blacks, too, are deep and inky – although there's a slight grey tinge to the Pixel when it's placed side-by-side with the Pixel XL or a Samsung Galaxy S7. Viewing angles are great, brightness is excellent, and the auto-brightness is easily the best I have used on Android.

Now, it’s looking to make it easier to shop for finds with an interesting new feature. The company describes its new Shop the Look experience as follows: When you search for an outfit with query like ‘cocktail attire’, Google will surface a photo of a fashion blogger wearing a cocktail dress and accessories to go with it; you can then check out those exact products, or similar looking ones through relevant Shopping ads. Watch Live Credit: Google Google says that the images it will feature in its Shop the Look experience will come from brands, bloggers and retailers that it’s partnered with, such as LIKEtoKNOW.it and Polyvore. It’s currently testing the feature on mobile devices in the US. It’s certainly an interesting approach: In addition to its powerful search capabilities, Google also has the ability to network extensively with bloggers and brands to cover just about every fashion query people can come up with. That negates the need for users to download apps from multiple stores and search through each of them separately, while also scoring big bucks for Google.

Alphabet Inc's Google is acquiring cloud software company Apigee Corp in a deal valued at about $625 million, the tech giant's latest effort to claim a greater share of the lucrative cloud business. San Jose-based Apigee's software helps companies' digital services interact with apps used by customers and partners. The service is critical for businesses transitioning to the cloud, Diane Greene, who runs Google's cloud computing division, said in an interview. "They are a leader in this application programming interface area," she said. ALSO READ: * Google reveals new products and services, taking aim at its biggest rivals * Cloud computing 'lifts small firms' firepower' * Google slashes cloud computing prices Cloud computing is the increasingly popular practice of using remote internet servers to store, manage and process data. Apigee specialises in managing so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, the channels through which digital services connect when a company logs a purchase for a customer or places an order with a supplier. Greene, a former VMware CEO, has pushed to raise Google's profile in corporate computing since she joined last year. During her tenure, Google has streamlined engineering efforts and appointed new leadership for its cloud efforts, improving traction with clients, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call. Greene predicted that the Apigee acquisition would redouble Google's momentum. "Our customer lists are extremely complimentary," she said. "There's some overlap and some areas where we are going to be able to help each other once [the deal] closes." Ad Feedback The Apigee deal comes a day after Google and online storage company Box Inc said they would partner to enable Box's corporate customers to integrate Google's suite of word processing, spreadsheets and other productivity tools, known as Google Docs. Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, IBM Corp and others are vying for a share of the fast-growing corporate cloud computing business. Apigee, with high-profile clients in a strategically important area, will help Google close in on the competition, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. "Google has fallen behind both Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services in enterprise cloud computing, and this move is intended to strengthen that position," he wrote in an email. Google will pay Apigee shareholders $17.40 for each share, a 6.5 percent premium to the stock's Wednesday close. Apigee's shares were slightly above the offer price at $17.43 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading on Thursday.  - Reuters Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Digital Living story: iOS 10, macOS Sierra, watchOS 3: what's new in Apple's latest operating systems Technology Homepage Comments technology headlines India top for selfie deaths Live: 7.8 New Zealand quake Prepare to be disrupted, futurists warn An optimist on the future of energy Facebook blocks fake news ads Bug sending phone data to China Google app digitises old photos Video calling comes to WhatsApp Facebook a careless media company Super Mario hits iOS on Dec 16 Apple eyeing smart glasses Twitter to thwart cyber-bullying Sleeping woman burnt by iPhone PS4 Pro: Hands on review Consumer drone market slumps Ad Feedback Most popular Viewed Shared Commented President-elect Donald Trump name-checks New Zealand in morning Twitter tirade Live: 7.8 New Zealand earthquake 'I'm buggered - I need a beer': first overland relief reaches Kaikoura OPINION: Brian Tamaki can go to hell, but his followers can still be saved Fears of rapid failure of new lake caused by quake near Kaikoura Quake evacuees from Kaikoura arrive in Christchurch on HMNZS Canterbury Over 100 rentals abandoned after the earthquake What Kaikoura looks like now, after the 7.5 earthquake - in pictures Bikies left stranded in Kaikoura at the local pub Weta 'IT geek' captures Wellington tsunami surge after earthquake rocks New Zealand Famous seal breeding ground destroyed by quake 'I'm buggered - I need a beer': first overland relief reaches Kaikoura Live: 7.8 New Zealand earthquake Quake evacuees from Kaikoura arrive in Christchurch on HMNZS Canterbury Post-quake freeze on new insurance cover catches out home buyers and sellers Hail stones the size of golf balls hit Ashburton during storm Pictures of rescued quake cows released Feature video: The quake - and everything that followed For info on toilets, take a seat and get bowled over Questions asked in capital but engineers say no such thing as 'earthquake-proof' special offers Ad Feedback National World Business Technology Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Stuff.co.nz About Us | Contact Us | View Mobile Site Subscribe Text | Follow us on Facebook and Twitter | Newspapers | Magazine subscriptions | RSS - Top Stories Services Stuff Fibre | Newspapers in Education | A-Z Directories | Online Advertising | Print Advertising | Careers Classifieds Death Notices | Celebrations | Trade Me | Jobs | Property | Motors | Accommodation | Personals | Newspaper Classifieds Newspapers Dominion Post | The Press | Waikato Times | Auckland Now | Sunday News | Sunday Star-Times   Marlborough Express | Manawatu Standard | Nelson Mail | Southland Times | Taranaki Daily News | Timaru Herald Other Sites Essential Mums | Cuisine | NZ House & Garden | NZ Fishing News | NZ Life & Leisure | NZ Gardener | Fairfax Archives Breaking news?

Android 7.0 Nougat OTA for Nexus 6P Starts Rolling Out The OTA has been delayed due to an issue Sep 9, 2016 07:23 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google released the stable version of its latest Android OS about a month ago, and many Nexus and Pixel device owners have been able to download the Android 7.0 Nougat for their smartphones and tablets. However, it seems that a specific group of users have been complaining about performance and battery issues. Owners of Nexus 6P smartphones who downloaded the factory image for their devices have been affected by some serious performance issues and battery draining. Google has pulled Nexus 6P factory images from its Google Nexus OTA page, but the issue hasn’t been resolved. Vodafone Australia has issued a short statement regarding the matter, saying that “An issue is affecting rollout of this software update and we are working with Huawei to resolve ASAP. We apologise for any inconvenience caused and will keep you posted as soon as we have an update.” It seems that the problem originated at Huawei and not Google.

Lyft and Gett Get Google Maps Integration Users will be able to get rides directly from Google Maps Sep 9, 2016 06:56 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google is constantly working on updates to its Google Maps application, seeing how it’s one of the most popular mapping services out there. In March of this year, the company added a new way for people to find and compare the fastest route to get around town. Google added a ride services tab when searching for directions in Google Maps, which allowed users to find rides offered by various services. It seems that the Mountain View-based giant has recently updated the tab and added two more services from the US, Lyft and Gett. This means that Google Maps will now display ride services from 9 partners in over 60 countries. Users will be able to compare the fastest and most affordable rides, and they won’t be required to download or open multiple apps in order to so. In order to access ride services, users simply need to add their current location and destination into Google Maps app and tap on the ride services tab. They can find fare estimates and pick-up times, depending on the driver’s availability. Lyft will also show options for a Lyft Line ride, which means that the new feature comes integrated with all services found inside ride apps. Ride options from Lyft will be available across the US, but Gett is only limited within New York City. The update has already started rolling out to Google Maps on Android devices. Another feature that Google has recently introduced in its Maps app is the option to catch Pokemon. #Google#Google Maps#Lyft#Gett#ride services reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Risks $7.4 Billion Fine for Violating Antitrust Regulations in the EU Google Maps Gets Updated with Catching Pokemon Option Google Adds Voice Commands and Lists to Maps Application Google Explains Why It Didn’t Label Palestine in Maps Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China - Update OnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: Is It Worth the Upgrade?

San Jose-based Apigee's software helps companies' digital services interact with apps used by customers and partners. The service is critical for businesses transitioning to the cloud, Diane Greene, who runs Google's cloud computing division, said in an interview. "They are a leader in this application programming interface area," she said. Cloud computing is the increasingly popular practice of using remote internet servers to store, manage and process data. Apigee specializes in managing so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, the channels through which digital services connect when a company logs a purchase for a customer or places an order with a supplier.Google will pay Apigee shareholders $17.40 for each share, a 6.5 percent premium to the stock's Wednesday close. Apigee's shares were slightly above the offer price at $17.43 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading on Thursday. The company, whose customers include AT&T, Burberry Group Plc, Vodafone Group Plc and the World Bank, went public in April last year at $17 per share. Greene, a former VMware CEO, has pushed to raise Google's profile in corporate computing since she joined last year. During her tenure, Google has streamlined engineering efforts and appointed new leadership for its cloud efforts, improving traction with clients, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call. Greene predicted that the Apigee acquisition would redouble Google's momentum. "Our customer lists are extremely complimentary," she said. "There's some overlap and some areas where we are going to be able to help each other once [the deal] closes." The Apigee deal comes a day after Google and online storage company Box Inc said they would partner to enable Box's corporate customers to integrate Google's suite of word processing, spreadsheets and other productivity tools, known as Google Docs. Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, IBM Corp and others are vying for a share of the fast-growing corporate cloud computing business. Apigee, with high-profile clients in a strategically important area, will help Google close in on the competition, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. "Google has fallen behind both Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services in enterprise cloud computing, and this move is intended to strengthen that position," he wrote in an email. © Thomson Reuters 2016 Tags: Google, Cloud, Cloud Computing, Amazon, Microsoft, Apps Facebook Says It Wants to Help Businesses Expand Internationally Google to Buy Cloud Software Company Apigee for $625 Million     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Lyf Wind 7i OnePlus 3T Gionee S9 Vivo V5 Huawei Mate 9 Pro HTC Bolt Hyve Pryme Panasonic P71 Zopo Color F2 Motorola Moto M Lyf F8 Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) General Mobile GM5 Xiaomi Redmi 4A Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime Xiaomi Redmi 4 Micromax Canvas Spark 4G Porsche Design Huawei Mate 9 Meizu Pro 6s Samsung W2017 Popular iPhone 7 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Moto G4 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Redmi Note 3 iPhone SE Sony Xperia Z5 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones From Gadgets 360 Shop » Panasonic Eluga Turbo In Mobiles Buy Now Rs. 13,999Rs. 7,999 Yu Yureka Plus In Mobiles Buy Now Rs. 12,500Rs. 6,389 Micromax Canvas Juice 4G ...

Pricing and it. I don't have a price needs a nickname. The spot and think about it I mean I cystic elect Chris price I mean we all know that he's very Smart he has on money. Estimates our guys no doubt on Thursday. Metro. I I don't limited time news minute but it it was that got a lot of K I do. A bullet yet he's he's a very like the deathly as the elbow patches on the tweed jacket. If you as a professor Arabia having office acted so secrets president. Of the beautiful and I got it right years you know W. i.s NFL guy featured guy scores for price. And Sunday. The news that question is what does it preppy price rat on a prep which you know that would feed. Of course she. Went to college which northeastern. Ago that's climate. That was blue collar votes in the northeastern to greet school courts it's a great school but I figured you for I was like. Princeton. Where Allah be able to right right handed him. A year. Ago. So do you get into the prep school to go with the audience daughters out the window we've Mayo no I I was always one. Always northeast instrument you look at it like it's. School because of work. Experience the whole program it's like in Steve and on the soap box here for a moment in preached about you the core program. For some reason not police the which college student in dollar. It appear as a lot of it acquired exactly. Working at the twenty neutral larger work it is northeastern port information. It. Jack Arnold Jack Google's legends eggs legend and all the Little League all legal expertise. Agree. Tracked an old mean the late great Dick Kelly acknowledged eighty carbonneau the best big guys that love their school. Orders school collars on their sleeves I mean. Fair test of just a well anyways so gonna go prep. Elected via Google were to prep for work at a at a pricey oil that's the right ms. Clinton and her friends called a totally different rights anyways. Christopher price noticed prep for now on NFL Sunday we have a lot of work to today. Cut down day yesterday as you heard as many view learned through social media W the Idec comment following Chris on Twitter. Aaron Dobson to shine a key shot Marten. Among those cut there on the gonna carry four wide receivers. I'd DJ Foster great story of the camp he has made to clog good for him despite fumbling in the game against the giants Tyler Gaffney he's done he's gonna go on I all art. But Garrett wants somebody thought that. He would be or some people thought he would be casualty he makes the club. And as Chris mentioned meters along weeks ago in his or other they're gonna make other changes it'd be made it. Think it was in 2013 to meet fifteen changes between the final cuts. And the start of the regular season and no it right it was a piece of now W yet icon that looks basically you know. They have the foundational elements in place. You know it they're no it does not mean huge surprise I mean it's you know breeding yodeling Gradkowski him all those guys. But there's going to be some roster tweaking if you wanna call it that between now weighs in September 11 there's inevitably there are guys we're gonna shake out today. Or gonna clear waivers were going to be available. There are guys who are on the market now. I was told yesterday that the patriots are going to. Look to. Add some depth at the wide receiver position malaria 40 yeah right yeah carried fort tight ends as of today yet and you need to add more yeah I think you need at BB one more body what your position are you intriguing names out there we get into a little bit later on but. Delta lead your point they're going to be moved reed. Between now would throw regular seat but 53 guys they have at this moment. Are not going to be missing 53 guys they're gonna take or what happens to AJ derby I think GG derby sticks. Do I think he Jeter so they keep four tight ends that need to recognize that a 34 tight end indeed they make some moves. Elsewhere and that's it. Yeah whether or tight ends endeavor and exactly and Devlin really look he's a full back in game but he works for the titans right towards the but it released back Alex and he knew he sits there so I think you can you can sympathy for half pregnant with the so. But you can add subtract the smothers may be take we defensive lineman BB. New YouTube cut a defensive lineman. Did you feel secure in saying you can get the practice squad because he got to expose those guys through waivers. And that's always a little bit but they cease to choice if you're gonna show today yet there it is convenient for guys were cut yesterday or going to circle back around this afternoon and be resigned to the practice squat so that a lot of moving parts when you're talking about roster building system. So who goes that you'd feel. Somebody's gonna have to go to pick up a wide receiver yeah they're more or doing I mean here's my point Chris when you talk about wide receivers and I've been in this debate what many people. I look at the tight ends and look at the wide receivers is one group looking to casket yes. You know Crocs a pass catcher Bennett's caskets of what we've seen AG derbies of basket so. I think you have six pass catchers if you include your full wide receivers. You two top tight end yet that that's when when people look at the wide receiver depth on this team that traditionally going back over many years. They always we if you look at it on paper you people honorable short here and it was tiger's sex you're your your point being you know you'd you don't feed uranium. But statins being as active as they are in the passing what they're good I mean it exciting group that the tool and should be good for 130 catches you that's when fifty what fifty fine when I Indy could still I still think they could push as a group but the thing is the 2011 team. With Hernandez and housekeepers at the record for best. Season intricate production at the tide in position right chargers to their cattle without charge resulted put it but it but you know the over under for that group. 150 catches sure and I think that's only about Ayers if you have two more wide receive yeah but did but then the other thing it you'll if you feel like you need to someone. You know became free yesterday a new braverman is a guy who I kept hearing on my Twitter feed a seventh round pick. He was cut loose. I believe Ohio State kid who who'd just appears to be that sort fee for two wings opened in terms of kind of a it was small shifty wide receiver who do you think may become Alito and Roberts. Rookie linebacker believe it's extra pick at Houston knew you could set you could subtracting beer. To add another wide receiver Matthew Slater can always catch a football you can yeah it the other thing too is you have guys again your point. You are so deep that the tide in position you'll are. Relatively. Not incredibly deep but it being relatively deep if you figuring you know Louis coming back Quincy midway through the year. When you talk about pass catching bad acts as well and so you don't you you you look you know fall Mexican capital general Dwight can catch what you heard what can catch a football ask not what he does best but the over the course of Missouri's economy and for what you know coming in what passes and you have America situation where you have nine pass catchers I mean that I just I hate to oversimplify it but. You know with the two tight ends in the four wide receivers and I'm not including Slater. You throw in blunt. White and DJ Foster those at nine pass catching players yet if fine. And if somebody becomes available fine but it's it's it's always does this. Hearkened back to Joseph before. This is always distributable her preaching premiere not to because the cuts to read yesterday. But because of the cuts that we're talking about now the often moves that it you know a guy tweets out I mean to me the fifty telling them in the NFL and cut at the ticked at the Britney are right in the end you know coach es you off so it's. Gonna cut loose because another player became available but it's such a dynamic situation this weekend. In having bills that a punitive at that. Over the course this week. Apart from the draft this is when 90% of the roster. You know that the big roster decisions made keeping guys on the roster cutting move into the practice squad putting them on him. Injured reserve all right Erica fashion as a national anyway so let's I wanna with the added we derby. Can they can do everything with no they can't now they're doing it and all kinds yeah I mean if you started at duke you could in theory if you did not practice start music but pop. Okay and now you can ID DB some flexibility with them but I think he has played well and outlook yet a setback and a third preaches and about the little low against Burleigh but I think. The real before preceding games it played well yeah over the course treating him when we saw him he played well I think he earned a spot in this 53 man roster he's going to be interesting guy for a couple of reasons. The least of which you only move to tight end a couple of years ago. If the quarterback can count but some time quarterback in college. His dad plea for that attack at least I believe trying to promote them. Was in Cleveland while the Chinese Communist connect it to get accurate and it joked about it you know he knows he's really old now because he's coaching you know sons of guys I expect in the ninety's but. Derbies an interesting guy anything he does a really nice job filling out that that that targeted group harbor was I was surprised because. I was so surprised he kept her because not only was he banged up. Throughout the summary B struggled to stay on the field consistently. When he didn't get on the field. What a whole lot in terms of production and now that's not his primary job. He is more be blocking tight and he's more of a kind of in dozed garden for a more from Marcel Reese each back fullback type guy so look don't look signal. God has blessed our don't look for for Clay Harbor WB for basically sooner or no he's at right what he is barely lost yet you've why don't I don't basically don't use that as a measuring stick. You don't want clean harbors abilities Clara respected BS attached to tell us the game but quite harbor is it would blocking president. Whipping is gonna bring back the table talk about it you don't expect. I mean he's going to be off a right tackle yet. Because Paul is heard yet if maybe that's why you know what. You go in it's it's like a domino thing where. BB that's one of the reasons why he decided to round even though he wasn't heated up a great summer. You look at this offensive line and you look at his blocking skills and say look there's value beer in tapping him as an end of the line tight games. In the three tied in situation because parents Toxics welders. In these. Harrell round all right so running yet terrible you have terrible on the right side and candidates whose nickname gonna call it terrible. I'm very rapid he's terror gate area okay don't just call it terrible and then on the left side. What is it act cameras sold at Bono he's her what's the deal that still sold there's still he's just yet -- -- it's more safe than sorry alliance stating at this point it would look you don't you don't need blowing a camera what's his face is analysts wondering OK if monetary fund ball on the left side. So I've terrible and fumbled as much bookends in Italy has later lot of late in is probably your number one swing tackle option at this point well but yet and that's what those areas. We talked about the wide receiver spot. That's one of those areas where they could go look for tackle between now the start of the year Detroit builds a depth to try not to trade. You know. Recoup whatever there's there's there's some teams that are route right battery trusting you could still go and get a guy. To help build up there or not you're not gonna get Jonathan Ogden at the owner would you do McNeal funny guy. 6177797937. Is there is the number if you haven't questions regarding the Ross who Chris price. As Chris pointed out some moves are going to be made today. It is not over with. Jeff how brought up some names in his column today and they Errol it just force and a runny Helmand from the Broncos. The BC today Andre Williams it seems to me that the patriots are also at the running back position I think you know a guy in bold and every year people say he's gonna get cut. But those who still like him in that role especially the special teams guy and the thing about Bolden. Is there are times during the year Winokur the football to get your first you know Armenians what he is never gonna breakthrough is never going to be. You're number one guy or even in number two guy but just when you've written him off ago. My guy got that's right I forgot credible on this exact regrettable that crossed it felt that we don't know at what time of year at least one time you're where you go right. Did you break I was process so you know I think Brandon Bolden is valuable in that bill knows what he has is that my fourth running back and he's a special team yet in they have those. Guys the built in people it's funny every single year at this time more often in non. People will match on Twitter Wednesday. I did you have so many of those special teams to what they have so many integrated teams in need of owners that. Because they're valuable gold than one of those guys I bolt is the five guys really. By BB six guys who wore. Course specialty numbers who could fill in as a potential guys. What you're not you know you're you know which are you you're you're not you'd of that and Slater they're probable to they're which we need guys like pat on the back into roster are going to be successful. I don't gate do we we're excited or emotional anymore rating in a coaches. Did he get to RH were cynical which are cynical here we are you know. You get abused enough on Twitter you go yelled at him up by players in getting it from both cents. So you become a cynic like myself. But I will say that I thought it was very cool. Bill Belichick were Nate and there's rogue features. I loved I loved that I loved that I loved it call me a hawk I'm sorry. I just thought it was. It just it was just to pay it it goes like people talk about like bill and stuff like he's his role. It is air. It was just very cool woman yet and is being it being struck in there with. And he'd like I think he's always like need to order you loves those guys you love those guys those are hitting those DJ Foster dad loves those guys those walkers those larger house those specialty murderers those back into the secrets to tell the col or while he's the greatest coach ever bill Belichick's a marker and a grinder yeah I mean he's not a fancy guy province of crisis in Volvo we had fifteen years ago. He dresses like crap he watches twenty hours of video a day. Me got his first Erica when he stated you know started dating Linda petty and mean it really ME Hillis a marker I know is a marker on a grinder has a great one. But I think he relates to the DJ fosters an innate Anders more than he relates to a Tom Brady I knew where he gets hurt. At that place in west and there's those barber is the walls. It's always a while ago it's only remotely close you know again my natural monopoly when metro west to stay what do rent control while the democratic is that regular I don't live I live in it's it's Whittier I live in this bowl as possible please Wellesley. It like this this little pin and drew the smaller policies have at least for thousands have put it. I got a second wells out yeah exactly a little you know little where were alien an outdoor pool not an outdoor and it indoor pool. It's slow but it wealth and you cannot win on this now I mean you've that you live in while I and I understand it it there's no coming back from now I mean I have president laws that it's a nice house and an event for the school system it's on aggregate I a schools but when you say you live in laws that you just cannot escape there is not say that on just a regular guy. You know live at Wellesley added I like it at all and pass and the people exactly man of the people. Against six foot seven have a civilized have a nightly through seven effort if you have any questions for Chris regarding the roster of people get off on the stuff. Amazing to me right now a big football is the Red Sox will get into that a twelve noon. Rob Bradford will join us one of the voices one of the radio voices of the Boston Red Sox. No one is that mall atlas that when rob Bradford he will be joining us. And he can it will that it protects in the and they need to try to defend John Ferrell for ruining Stephen writes season. Joke I got a question for yet forgo or record to record a question where did you see. The picture from Gillette Stadium. I didn't know where it's a buyers picture. Of may happen at the White House to be of a joint twelve to topple like now's. Maybe Johnny picture of them you mean like he's dead wealth. Particularly that in spite of lying in state exactly yet he's dead yet Tom Brady is dead yet -- to wonder what you what you thought of that is I think it's a little trip as a I think it's a little much yeah. But we are gonna that's something I do wanna get its wanted to get this out of the way and let people ball look what I gonna break down the Ross are all day. I think we covered the big gains I wanna get into Brady if people are you know make it nowhere on Sunday morning and would like is going to be like without Brady. On the fact that you know he cut his thumb I think obviously while trying to peel off the NFL sticker. I think that I'm I am running with that theory be all apple waited a bank it's hard not to be ire of it's it's it makes complete sense but. You know. We got a final vote by I know you generally don't like to work on the weekends like you just commit him punch buttons and you you know you beat. To sit on your Hasselbeck yeah I'm gonna actually do a little bit of work now. And it's the element the that's why it why wouldn't people have told me that they've asked battle open to be part tie up full time here a number of times why. The pace Sox it's like Katrina it's like a purpose sweetener correct. You know he makes a lot of it's you you're so Smart he makes real money during the week you have any of before I was on a sunny it's screw around and tell me to go screw. If you can't find it there's a Larry Bird company asking about Paul George is on for the season. And if we can fight because one of the members members of the meat yet in Indiana asks bird races you know now the polls done for the year are you gonna Wear his number. On on New Jersey and bird like just in this French look wait lecture content like gay dads. So whatever it's the Brady twelve in the picture he's not dead lying in Steve he is not dead this is not you know. He's not he's gone for four games. Again it's a bit much from me. I mean it's a little old atop the widgets and in years is doing like thirty days to appease America thirty for thirty. On their site where it's thirty things about Brady as he sits out. You know which is just so hypocritical considering me helps groom in the first. I mean they're totally agree that fast news we get an inordinate it is of the courts on fast as the other team responds. Without brow idea that we wanna see what I wanna see how the locality feel how to react. I got somebody come back at somebody and attacks solicited just sitting and and they're saying and that's not a good that is probably going to be the theme of the show by the ways without pre Coca I'd should've said that up the top but we you know these cuts people get off from the stuff so. You know it's it's brought to show if you have any questions on the cuts that it WEEI dot com. Summit at a sex lies and they wanna know what's going on with cuts just you know on your phone going WEEI dot com follow Chris on Twitter. Ryan Hannibal they have all focused on like a rundown arriving by. And you just have to know the DJ Foster made the team carrying four tight ends. And is there where ago and Aaron Dobson a keystone Martin's that guy Chris has a really good. Article up on WEEI dot com about what happened Dobson. And you with a solo cut the basically distilled release that are no longer divers down which you know I don't dozen you know with this yet to earn Donaldson's putrid career well as well as you write because he makes a great play for 38 yard pick up I think he's sitting as a giant but yet go. Crises he's debts and then he allows an interception. Senses there's no there's between and stretch and what I found amazing about chris' piece of insulation beaded. Beat you talk to was that TJ may get to Jimoh mob here for like a blink it was I was likely that is what I am I I have out of a podcast before he yeah he was here for. Like instantly. A couple of caught you have he's a good talk and he's a good talker he's part dude you went to misery. And he he's he thinks he hops in his it's Moody's he's got great hands and runs great routes he's got all that is confident. Which I never heard yeah I always heard injury prone yet but he's just I'd never heard not confident I wonder in what they're trying draw the line between. What I saw from Aaron Dobson in the way I saw his teammates react to in his teammates really worked hard to pompous tires. In I never saw his teammates react to. Someone making a play more than erected here doubts. They went over the top when a dump market action yet in yo we're geared what was his biggest pain you know loved him and talked about it all the time. The of this great this guys work hard you blueprints of the the table. In a think those two I think it's he's advocate connect while I mean. In apps I say this analysis Terry I'm not joking around is he should get a sports psychology. No there's no question I mean he should he should get it I've heard of I mean it this happens all the time he's kicker he's got the tools correct he has that two. Because then you know the heads of each negotiate sports psychologist. In the NFL because all of my years. There's if there's one thing I've learned. What makes great players great and even makes good plays good based on their ability is every play's the thing. Use the play after you make a bad play it's the same after the play you made good play every place senate too dissimilar. Brady throws a touchdown pass thanks place's name Brady throws an interception that next places. And that's what he asked learn ought to grab this call real quick we are gonna talk about. Brady against Tom Brady is is deceased I didn't know that I if you looked at the but did the tribute in Foxboro. They have his picture of Chris prices we have to re tweet that out and I am gonna put wouldn't wanna go we're going to posted the blog and every tweeted this morning through its very I mean there's a picture end of Brady and fox. Wrote light house and the number twelve and I don't even know Brady was jail you know I didn't know he was hell let's go to Michael in Brooklyn Michael Europe on W yeah. Michael. We appreciate. It is good how are you good review what I did and as a surge of art work are you a couple weeks old. Your IE yes I honestly don't remember he has no clue. Got twenty minute composition about why you shall Brandon. Childhood. To say yes I. Sure as read it carefully it anyway out I was. Go and I think ultimately an odd yes I do do light went off a light went on exactly exactly Michael. Anyway. I am slow probably to doubt you have as quick as quarterback rob I. Yes like Emma creature that. But all my car that. What are you gonna no problem because at that point brought. It on creating jobs will let nobody got suspended. Didn't even as well I. Listen Michael the team has to move on. The fans are not gonna move on because he's Tom Brady. And we really appreciate the phone call Chris will remember unit I do is and it's I do remember I've Cuba yet let's look at it was just what I was thinking I was thinking Hewitt was to reflect camera internal rodeo was you know and maybe it's just the Sunday morning fact Chris and maybe it's because in the views are very genteel compassionate man. And I'm not win you know when you know who you know Satan Lucifer is six to ten also noticed Kirk and Callahan. Com by. I I said I thought their ballots accordingly undershirt is cool. I also do have compassion for Brady and I don't have to pack I understand he's a millionaire in the standings analysts monies it girlfriend. But I have compassion for players when they leave the game and I've seen because they've seen it personally folks believe the enemy. I've seen this when guys leave to gain him a very hard time. You know when Johnny ballots and who was a great red sock. You know in in he was working as a broadcast with us in penalties in him I don't think of speaking at attorney but I could tell that you know John he's a great guy I was kind of he was media had all the money in the world and money was not an issue but he was struggling to find his place who's trying to be a broadcaster. He was working out with the double A team up in Manchester I think the GP maturities minor league club bees work as a hitting coach. I've seen it would guys for the economy and meaning to Troy Brown you know work for the sick Comcast's trial watch a return any you know under his breath of odd man. When I give just one more time to try to run when Barack meet so. On I have compassion for Brady a lot of guys when they leave the game they if they struggle with addiction they struggle with depression obviously the competitive aspect of credit and ask don't have anything -- -- right that emit competitive aspect you know if you look at your job like. If you love your job in in all the senate to stand in your home to put yourself in his shoes. And you know even even at my place like a context in a it's so much that people said you you know why do you love your job what he. Sports are the same the names don't change you know there's always a hold out there's always a disgruntled player it's always a guy that should be playing it isn't that doesn't change. But I loved them the ball Boston it goes on between the on air talent in the and then in the producers and and everybody that works there is it's a locker room atmosphere. And Brady's gonna miss him. For four weeks and I feel bad for him any time you take something away from someone who loves whatever it is they do. I think they have to find another route that they have to fines in this is why we were starting your stories no more and more. He's going to he's gonna cranky so busy he's going to be going to the Michigan game he's going to be doing this he's right doing this he's got the thing with Michael Strahan. You know the show whatever whatever it is going to be so assuming he's going to be able to trying to fill that void. The thing for him to remember is he can. But this is a guy who has in his weight room a countdown clock is horrible 51. In set he can just sit there and he sit their there's cross the days off the calendar. Answering look amity close remedy close from you know in in that I think that's going to be his approach he's going to try to busy himself. Between now and and as best as possible until you get back by feel worse for him to sell conceit is going to be a pain in the also the Brady controversy that's next on NFL's.

It has fought bitter court battles against Apple, Microsoft, Oracle and PayPal. It has faced a well-financed campaign by Oracle, TripAdvisor, Expedia, Nokia and others against its European operations, plus a similar action driven by Yelp. It’s been targeted in a lawsuit by AT&T over access to utility poles for Google Fiber. Now, in what appears to be a new tactic on the technology industry battleground, Google has come under attack by a mysterious group that keeps mum about its sponsors while issuing scathing reports about the Mountain View search giant’s influence on government. Among its recent revelations: High-ranking Google execs have had more than 20 “intimate” meetings with President Barack Obama, and the company has a revolving-door employment relationship with the federal government. While the backers of the “Google Transparency Project” may be hidden, its purpose is clear, observers say: To offer purportedly objective research and commentary that can be used to thwart Google’s burgeoning power in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere, much as similar “think tanks” have sought to undermine the environmental lobby or promote development projects. “When you’re successful, you’re on top of the hill. You become a target,” said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management who studies the technology industry. Google, with a market capitalization of $529 billion, is a Goliath among Bay Area tech giants. It is known for disrupting industries around the world, from travel to media to transportation, making it enemy No. 1 for many competitors and leaving a trail of lawsuits in its wake. Oracle is still fighting to renew a failed $9 billion lawsuit accusing Google of stealing Oracle code to cash in on the Android mobile operating system. Google and the Transparency Project both declined to comment. So far, only Redwood Shores-based Oracle has admitted to funding the Transparency Project, telling Fortune it wanted the public to know about its support for the initiative. Oracle declined to comment to this newspaper. Other companies that have tangled with Google have denied involvement with the project, including AT&T, Yelp and Microsoft. “This is an attempt to influence policy, essentially, to restrict the behavior of your competitor who you feel is either monopolistic or competing unfairly,” Cusumano said. American companies have long assailed competitors by sponsoring damaging research, but the Transparency Project’s approach — highly public attacks combined with profound secrecy about its backers — is a new tactic in Silicon Valley tech, said Steve Blank, a lecturer at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business and prominent Silicon Valley observer. “This is just a symptom of a much bigger game. What you want to do if you’re a corporation is you want to influence policy for your interest,” Blank said. “We’re just like any other industry now. This is what this game has gotten down to in Silicon Valley because the stakes are big enough.” Just as there’s nothing illegal about the activities that have put Google in the cross hairs of the Transparency Project — lobbying, sponsoring research, and building close ties with U.S. officials — the project’s secrecy-shrouded attack-dog work also appears not to cross any legal lines. “I don’t see any of this as nefarious,” said former U.S. Department of Justice chief economist Daniel Rubinfeld, an emeritus professor at the UC Berkeley School of Law. “It’s changing times. Companies are battling each other on many more fronts than they used to.” The Transparency Project commenced hostilities against Google in April, gaining national media attention with a report tracking the number of Googlers taking jobs in the White House and federal agencies, and the number of federal officials traveling in the other direction, into Google. Project researchers reported 113 “revolving door” moves between Google — plus itsassociated companies, law firms and lobbyists — and the White House and federal agencies. “Over the past decade, Google has transformed itself from the dominant internet search engine into a global business empire that touches on almost every facet of people’s lives — often without their knowledge or consent,” the group’s first report said. “It scans the content of people’s emails, tracks their activities online and their movements in the real world. It analyzes their search queries and behavior in ways many find troubling. At the same time, the company has assiduously courted Washington.” Another report, based on White House guest logs, cites 427 visits by employees of Google and “associated entities” to the White House since January 2009, with 21 “small, intimate” meetings between senior Google executives and Obama. “Google executives have had extraordinary access to the White House meetings at which policies are set … meetings encompassing a surprisingly wide range of topics including intellectual property, national security, government contracts, digital media strategy, antitrust, biotechnology, energy and climate change, broadband and telecommunications, foreign policy, health care, aerospace and aeronautics,” the report said. Another missive from the organization suggested that Google was influencing government policymakers on the sly by funding researchers who kept quiet about their ties to the company while promoting policies favorable to Google. “Google-funded academics are playing an outsize role in the debate over the U.S. government’s policy on internet privacy, a rapidly evolving area and an existential issue for Google,” the report said. “They are also often at the epicenter of policy research on antitrust issues in the age of digital platforms, another issue in which Google has a major stake.” Google declined to comment on the project’s critiques. But none of the corporate behaviors described in the critical reports surprised UC Berkeley’s Blank. “Businesses will spend what’s necessary to influence policy,” Blank said. “It raises the larger issue of whether any industry people should have that level of influence. We’ve built what I call a deep-pockets democracy. If you have deep pockets you have more access (to government officials) than a nonprofit or somebody who’s trying to represent Americans. “What’s not being represented by either Oracle or Google is the public interest.” However, Google’s competitors stand to gain from the Transparency Project’s spotlight on the firm’s aggressive efforts to mold policy, Cusumano of MIT said. Government officials might be less likely to make or promote policies benefiting Google if they felt the company’s influence was being monitored, Cusumano said. “They might re-evaluate what they’re doing or thinking of doing,” Cusumano said. For a group devoted to “transparency,” the Google project’s origins are obscure. It is run by the nonprofit Campaign for Accountability, a group that says it is dedicated to exposing government and corporate malfeasance and which started as an offshoot of the deep-pocketed New Venture Fund. The New Venture Fund is heavily supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. A Gates Foundation spokeswoman did not provide an answer when asked whether the foundation was aware of the venture fund’s work on the Google Transparency Project. The Hewlett Foundation said none of its donations went to the project. The Campaign for Accountability does not publicly reveal its connection to the venture fund — in fact its deputy director claimed to this newspaper in July that it was not a project of NVF, despite this newspaper having donated $1 to the campaign and received a tax receipt from the fund in return. However, the fund’s president later admitted it did run the Campaign, but said it was spinning it off into a new organization called Hopewell Fund. Among Hopewell’s three directors is Michael Slaby, who appears to be the same man who was an election-campaign-technology guru behind Obama’s two successful runs, and whose campaign-tech platform The Groundwork is being used by the Hillary Clinton campaign. In a bizarre and quite possibly coincidental twist, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is reportedly the main investor in The Groundwork, raising the puzzling specter of the influential and respected Googler funding the work of a man whose side project is attacking Google. Google declined to provide access to Schmidt, who is now executive chairman of Google parent Alphabet, and Slaby did not respond to interview requests. Contact Ethan Baron at 408-920-5011.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Google parent Alphabet to drop burritos by drone 2016-09-09 06:59 Post a comment 0 share: RELATED ARTICLES Google taking on Amazon with drone fleet Google buys solar-powered drone maker PHOTOS: Local robot set to disrupt global power industry San Francisco - A team at Google parent Alphabet working on unmanned aerial systems this month will try out delivering burritos by drone on a college campus in Virginia. Astro Teller, playfully referred to as the 'Captain of Moonshots' at an X lab created at Google to pursue big-vision projects such as drones and self-driving cars, said in a blog post that Project Wing team was ready to launch the test of a prototype drone delivery system. US officials announced last week that Alphabet is joining tests for drone deliveries, as the White House unveiled accelerated rulemaking for commercial unmanned aircraft operations. Teller said that a Wing prototype is ready for testing and that the team will run hundreds of flights in Virginia over the course of several days to deliver lunches prepared in an on-site food truck by Mexican food chain Chipotle. "We want to learn how people feel when they're receiving a package by air, and taking someone's time and/or money changes things more than a little," Teller said. "And we want to feel the pressure of unexpected circumstances that show us how we can get better at loading and managing a fleet of planes." The Project Wing team opted to try out delivering food to create operating challenges including "a lunchtime rush of burrito orders" as well as having to get food to customers hot and in the right shape, according to Teller. "In future tests, we could add a broader range of items, like drinks, which will push us to handle more weight, keep packages carefully balanced, and manage combinations of items on a single flight," he added. He believes drones will be available within the next decade for important missions such as delivering medicine and other supplies to areas cut off by disasters and helping emergency responders battle wildfires. At a "White House Drone Day" event last week, officials announced steps toward expanding rules for drone operations, including for newsgathering and commercial flights over populated areas, after a first set of regulations unveiled in June. "We hope to propose a rule on unmanned aircraft operations over people by the end of this year," Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Huerta said. The government has registered more than 500 000 hobby drones in eight months, but sees a need for more rules for commercial operators, he added. The first set of rules stop short of allowing some long-sought applications, including delivery of goods by retailers like Amazon in populated areas. As the world's largest online retailer, Amazon raised eyebrows in late 2013 with its plan to airlift small parcels to customers by drone in select markets less than 30 minutes after orders are received. It has gone to other countries to test its evolving technology, and last month announced plans for test deliveries in Britain.

Skip to content Best Apps on Google Play Menu Home Apps Tools Games Others HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE Posted on September 9, 2016 by Hannah Cannon The Google Play Store is a treasure trove of apps and content. It’s sometimes necessary to install the Play Store manually if you unintentionally uninstalled it or want to roll back to a previous version to avoid bugs. Here’s how to download and how to install the Play Store (currently version 6.9.15), along with details of the new features each update introduces. A note on Google Play Store version numbers The numbering system for Google Play Store versions may seem a little confusing at first, but it’s easy to get your head around. If the jumps between numbers seem odd, that’s simply because Google didn’t publicly release the versions in between. Note that new Play Store versions can delete old features as well as introduce new ones, so we’ve detailed what each new version brings in at the bottom of this article. Download Google Play Store APK Please note that the following guide is for owners of an Android device with a licensed version of the Play Store installed. We recognize that is sometimes necessary to re-install or roll back the Play Store. The latest version of Google Play is 6.9.15 and this version hints at several upcoming new features, including the ability to test apps without downloading them to your device. For more details, head to our what’s new in Google Play section and if you’re having problems, check out our guide to troubleshooting Google Play. How to install Google Play Store The simplest method for how to install the Play Store will already be quite familiar to you if you’re an avid follower of AndroidPIT: just install the Play Store APK manually. An APK is the Android equivalent to an .exe program on your computer. Instead of downloading an app from the Play Store, you simply install it yourself without the Play Store’s help (see our guide on installing apps outside of Google Play). This is extra useful when the app you want to install is the Play Store itself. There are two ways to get the Google Play APK installed on your device: directly on your phone or with your computer. We’ll do the easy option first. Install Google Play (phone method) Enable Unknown Sources by going to Settings > Security, then ticking the box next to Unknown sources. Don’t be alarmed, unknown sources are simply locations outside of the Play Store, which is critical if it’s the Play Store itself that you want. (Don’t forget to uncheck this option once you’re done) Using the browser on your device, go to XDA Developers forum or APK Mirror to download the APK for the latest version of the Play Store. You may get a message warning that “this type of file can harm your device.” Ignore it (trust us) and tap OK. Open the APK (you can tap the completed download in your notifications menu), read the new permissions (if any) that the new Play Store version requests, then tap Install. Install Google Play (computer method) If you don’t have a data or Wi-Fi connection on your device, you can download the APK to your computer instead. The same process applies: Enable Unknown sources on your device. Using the browser on your computer, go to XDA Developers forum or APK Mirror to download the APK for the latest version of the Play Store. Connect your device to your computer with a USB cable and copy the APK over to your Android device. Launch the APK, accept the permissions and tap Install. Google Play Store troubleshooting Google Services Framework is a crucial service that lets the Play Store communicate with apps on your device, allowing for automatic updates and so on. If these functions stop working, or you experience other problems, then there may be a problem with the service, and you should clear the cache on Google Play Store and Google Play Services. To do this: Go to Settings > Apps Scroll down to Google Play Store, tap it, then tap Clear cache. Do the same for Google Play services That should fix most problems you’ll experience with the Play Store Note: depending on what type of device you have, it may need to be rooted in order to manually install the Play Store, but that’s a tutorial for another day. What’s new in Google Play What’s new in Google Play 6.9.15 The latest version of the Google Play Store hints at several upcoming features. First and foremost, Google has implemented an ‘App Streaming’ function into searches so that you can test an app without downloading it onto your device. This was pointed out by Android Police, who claim that the apps load on a remote server and are then streamed to your device and that this is not the same as Google’s upcoming ‘Instant Apps’ feature. Though app streaming is currently only found in the ‘Apps’ tab when conducting an online Google search, it would appear that this will be rolled out to the Play Store at some point in the future. Additionally, version 6.9.15 indicates that a Play Store purchase interface specifically for VR could be in the works. Typically, making purchases in the Play Store requires the use of your smartphone to complete the process. Code in version 6.9.15 suggests this could soon change. What’s new in Google Play 6.2.10 – 6.5.08 Since February, Google has released what appears to be four different versions of the Play Store, designated by the ending letters A, B, C or D. This would suggest Google is conducting A/B testing on users. From what we can tell, these new features and changes include things like the removal of the scrolling window of featured apps on the Play Store homepage, icon changes, and other relatively minor things. One thing all the builds seem to share in common is that the Play Store now displays Download pending when an app is queued for download, rather than showing the animated downloading bar. What’s new in Google Play 6.0.5 In a helpful move for both developers and users, Google has added the ability for developers to generate promo codes, allowing paid apps and games, as well as in-app content, to be made available for free. Google also made a less substantial alteration to how reviews are judged by users. Now there is a small thumbs-up icon, just like on Facebook, that can be used to show agreement with a user review of an app. As part of this change, the spam button has been relegated to a side menu next to the thumb. It’s a subtle change that means it’s now easier to give positive feedback than negatively report reviews, which was likely abused by many. What’s new in Google Play 6.0.00 The biggest change in Google Play v6.0 is the long-awaited visual overhaul previewed by Googler Kirill Grouchnikov almost a month ago (shown below). The redesigned Google Play Store now divides content into two categories: apps and games, and entertainment. Previously, the front page showed six tabs. What’s new in Google Play 5.10.30 Google Play version 5.10.30 came quickly after version 5.10.29. There are only a few changes that we can see, the most notable of which the new Google Play font in the search bar, along with the ability to copy text from the Description and What’s New section. We still haven’t seen the new front page mentioned above, but that may well be Play Store version 6.0 or a server-side change. Other changes in the code that aren’t live yet reference books being grouped into series and app size information being displayed at installation time. What’s new in Google Play 5.9.11 The first thing you’ll notice in Google Play 5.9.11 is a new pop-up window letting you know about granular app permissions in apps compatible with Android 6.0. The team at Android Police revealed further documentation for fingerprint support, an uninstall manager (probably tied into Marshmallow’s RAM Manager), location-based recommendations and new visuals when refunding apps.

Dubbed 'Review from the Web,' the feature shows user-generated content from third-party websites in the mobile search results. The company will curate user reviews on places, TV shows, restaurants, movies and more from up to three websites and show them in the results directly. "Today, we're introducing Reviews from the web to local Knowledge Panels, to accompany our recently launched best-of lists and critic reviews features. Whether your site publishes editorial critic reviews, best-of places lists, or aggregates user ratings, this content can be featured in local Knowledge Panels when users are looking for places to go," reads a company blog post. Your search for Bollywood news on Google just got better India is a nation of movie buffs with 1 out of 10 mobile searches in the country being related to cinema, technology giant Google said today. The 'Review from the web' feature will arrive as an update to the Google app. The company has also provided guidelines as to how site owners can include the user rating from their sites for the feature. Last month, Google introduced 'In Apps' search mode for Android smartphones. The new feature enables users to quickly find content from the installed apps. To access the feature, users just have to go to the Google app on their Android device and find the 'In Apps' tab. The best part is that this feature works even when the user is not connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data. Using the 'In Apps' feature, users can find contacts and messages from inside the apps, search for any media, notes and more. Google Search now also provides users Bollywood-related answers through carousels powered by Knowledge Graph.

Chris Siebenmann :: CSpace » blog » spam » GoogleAccountNotificationSpam Welcome, guest. Someone's exploiting Google's account recovery system to send spam September 9, 2016 I've written before that spammers will eventually exploit any way of sending some user-supplied text to arbitrary email addresses. Today I got a beautiful example of this, where someone appears to be exploiting Google's process of managing account recovery options to send spam. Yes, really. (I can't be entirely sure of what's going on because the entire message is in Chinese and I'm feeding it through Google Translate in order to understand it.) The email was send to a pseudo-address that's never actually existed, so I can be confident there's nothing legitimate about the whole episode. However, it's a real Google message, about how '[the] recovery email address for your account was changed' (based on the translation). The account in question is xmbwauvikzwuqnwx@gmail.com, which seems very clearly to be just made up by the spammer for this purpose. Almost all of the text of the message is the boiler-plate Google notifications you get here (albeit in Chinese), but the spammer has managed to somehow get in one line of their own text (perhaps by setting it as the 'name' of this GMail account). I assume how this works is roughly that the spammer creates a bunch of random Google accounts, sets the 'name' or whatever appropriately, and then changes the recovery email address(es) to their targets. As you'd sort of want, Google automatically sends out a security notification, thereby transmitting the spammer's message for them. Apart from all of the work that's required to set this up, this seems rather neat and creative. (I'm merely guessing that the spammer is exploiting the account name to get their text in; it could be something else. I don't have any experience with the English version of this Google message to give me clues.) It also makes a good illustration of the lengths that spammers are prepared to go to and how hard it is to stop them, especially without impacting ordinary users. Stopping all user supplied text from leaking to email addresses under all circumstances is a very tall job; as with other security things, it's easy to add an innocent looking feature that opens up a hole or makes a previously harmless situation suddenly dangerous. And like other security issues, some of the obvious countermeasures are user-hostile. If Google doesn't include the user-supplied name in its security notification email, it forces people to try to remember what 'someaccount@gmail.com' is, as opposed to giving them a hint.

Google agreed to purchase the publicly traded company based in San Jose, Calif., a developer of tools and services for deploying and managing APIs, for $625 million. Apigee's software enables users to offer APIs to outside developers, collect analytics on their use, and secure the connections those software interfaces establish with outside applications. Those features integrated with other Google Cloud Platform tools will broaden the scope of solutions Google's channel can deploy for digital companies, partners told CRN. [Related: Here's Who Made Gartner's 2016 Magic Quadrant For Mobile App Development Platforms] "The addition of Apigee’s API solutions to Google cloud will accelerate our customers’ move to supporting their businesses with high-quality digital interactions. Apigee will make it much easier for the requisite APIs to be implemented and published with excellence," wrote Diane Greene, Google's senior vice president who runs all enterprise and cloud operations, in the company's blog. APIs are crucial to companies looking to extend the digital products they host on Google's cloud to more of their customers, according to the Mountain View, Calif.-based company's cloud chief. "They're the hubs through which companies, partners and customers interact, whether it's a small business applying online for a loan or a point-of-sale system sending your warranty information to the manufacturer," Greene said. Simon Margolis, director of cloud platform at SADA Systems, a Google cloud partner based in Los Angeles, told CRN that buying Apigee is an important move by Google, and a sort that partners were somewhat expecting. "More and more customers are looking to develop and deploy their own increasingly complex APIs via Google Cloud Platform," Margolis told CRN, "and this is the perfect fit to fill the gaps they still had remaining." With previous acquisitions, such as Firebase and Stackdriver, Google has merged those technologies with its existing tool sets in Google Cloud Platform. If that pattern holds with Apigee's features, Margolis said, "customers will be able to build custom-tailored API suites which leverage Google Cloud Platform's existing product set. " That will enable customers to do far more in customizing solutions built atop Google services like BigQuery and Pub/Sub, he said, and therefore drive more cloud business.

Cloud-managed WiFi eature integrates into Google for Education Mojo Networks, Inc. Many K-12 schools and districts have challenges in controlling what devices connect to their WiFi networks because of the limitations of current WiFi authentication techniques. With the continued growth of connected devices – iPads, Chromebooks, smartphones and tablets and more – in schools, there is a growing need for school IT administrators to control WiFi device connections. Mojo Networks, a leader in secure cloud managed WiFi for the K-12 educational market, announces Mojo Enforce. Enforce takes policies for network access and device management from third party systems and applies them to the WiFi network; the first integration for Enforce is with Google for Education. With Enforce, Mojo is the first cloud managed WiFi to integrate with Google for Education to ensure that only devices registered in the school’s Google domain are able to connect to the school WiFi network and enforce network access policies. This unique integration, coupled with Mojo Network’s robust cloud managed WiFi solution and high-performing access points, brings even more control, usability and ease-of-use to school districts. According to data from Google, more than 50 million students, teachers and administrators around the world rely on Google for Education to learn and work together. Managing the WiFi credentials for those 50-plus million and growing individuals is handled by the network administrator, but is not easily integrated. Currently, schools use two primary methods to authenticate devices on WiFi networks: PSK (Personal Shared Key) or 802.1x (the standard for port-based Network Access Control). But both have their limitations. PSK is easy to deploy but the passphrase is too easily shared with no real limitations, and 802.1x is costly as it typically requires on-premises appliances (AAA User Directory). In the case of Google for Education schools, there is a need to create a local copy of the user database from Google Apps. With both techniques, there is no real way for school network administrators to control which devices can connect to the network. Allowing unauthorized devices creates performance issues with too many devices; gives no visibility or control; and, creates IT management headaches. Mojo’s integration with Google adds an additional layer of authentication above PSK or 802.1x, providing administrators the control to define what devices connect to the network. Enforce is easy to setup with no additional licenses or on-prem appliances; it works on top of the existing school Mojo WiFi network without the need for any client or network re-configuration. “It’s great to see a WiFi infrastructure vendor like Mojo Networks develop a direct integration with Google for Education that solves a real challenge people in my position face daily,” said Vernon Young, Director of Information Technology at Oakland Catholic High School. “With this integration, I have real control over who connects to our network and am able to ensure secure access for every student and teacher throughout our high school.” “Mojo Networks looks to automate WiFi management for all our customers, whether it’s the large enterprise, higher education or K-12 school districts,” said Sriram Venkiteswaran, Director Product Management at Mojo Networks. “We look at technology and WiFi – and specifically the tools, automation and pricing of Mojo – as an enabler of education. With Mojo Enforce, we free up time for the network administrator, and secure WiFi for students and teachers alike with a low-cost, simple and functional process.” How Mojo Enforce Works Mojo Cloud fetches the enrolled devices (Chromebooks, iPads, etc.) from the school’s or district’s Google for Education account Mojo Cloud pushes out the allowed device list to all Mojo cloud managed access points The devices connect using either PSK or 802.1x authentication If authorized, access point assign role / network policy based on device OU membership If unauthorized, the access point denies the connection With the ease of set-up and use, what was a complicated process and a pain point for school districts has become a non-issue.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 9 September 2016 | MYT 10:10 AM Google to buy cloud software company Apigee for US$625mil Strategic investment: Google believes Apigee's service is critical for businesses transitioning to the cloud. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO:  Alphabet Inc's Google said it is acquiring cloud software company Apigee Corp in a deal valued at about US$625mil (RM2.5bil) , the tech giant’s latest effort to claim a greater share of the lucrative cloud business. San Jose-based Apigee's software helps companies' digital services interact with apps used by customers and partners. The service is critical for businesses transitioning to the cloud, Diane Greene, who runs Google's cloud computing division, said in an interview. "They are a leader in this application programming interface area," she said. Cloud computing is the increasingly popular practice of using remote Internet servers to store, manage and process data. Apigee specialises in managing so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, the channels through which digital services connect when a company logs a purchase for a customer or places an order with a supplier. Google will pay Apigee shareholders US$17.40 (RM70.75)  for each share, a 6.5% premium to the stock's Wednesday close. Apigee's shares were slightly above the offer price at US$17.43 (RM70.89)  on Nasdaq in afternoon trading on Thursday. The company, whose customers include AT&T, Burberry Group Plc, Vodafone Group Plc and the World Bank, went public in April last year at US$17 (RM69.13) per share. Greene, a former VMware CEO, has pushed to raise Google's profile in corporate computing since she joined last year. During her tenure, Google has streamlined engineering efforts and appointed new leadership for its cloud efforts, improving traction with clients, Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call. Greene predicted that the Apigee acquisition would redouble Google's momentum. "Our customer lists are extremely complimentary," she said. "There's some overlap and some areas where we are going to be able to help each other once [the deal] closes." The Apigee deal comes a day after Google and online storage company Box Inc said they would partner to enable Box's corporate customers to integrate Google's suite of word processing, spreadsheets and other productivity tools, known as Google Docs. Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, IBM Corp and others are vying for a share of the fast-growing corporate cloud computing business. Apigee, with high-profile clients in a strategically important area, will help Google close in on the competition, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. “Google has fallen behind both Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services in enterprise cloud computing, and this move is intended to strengthen that position,” he wrote in an e-mail. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Billionaire Ananda Krishnan exploring taking Astro private India bans Zakir Naik's NGO Maybank sells entire stake in Visa Inc for RM413mil Beware of Rove beetles Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Petronas’ net profit soars on lower impairment losses, other factors Malindo Air offering one million tickets to celebrate winning award Catch Doctor-X on the all-new dimsum.my! advertisement Latest News Rideshare service Lyft gets a flashy new look Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment Most Viewed in Tech Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Warning!

Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX David Swan Reporter @swan_legend Sydney-based online design firm Canva is looking to investors for a fresh round of capital according to reports. The Australian Financial Review is reporting Canva, which closed a $15m Series A round last October, is now seeking an additional round of more than $US10 million from existing investors including Blackbird Ventures. Other investors from the Series A round include Felicis Ventures, Matrix Partners, and Vayner Capital, the investment arm of Gary Vaynerchuk, while Hollywood actors Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson are also investors. Its CEO, 29-year-old Melanie Perkins, told The Australian earlier this year key investors and mentors including former Google executives Lars Rasmussen, who co-founded Google Maps, and Wesley Chan, who founded Google Analytics and Google Voice, have been invaluable as the start-up continues its transition from a small outfit to a global heavyweight. “We’ve been extremely fortunate. These guys have been incredibly helpful and supportive for us,” Ms Perkins said in an interview. “It’s an important aspect for us that we have the best of both worlds, a top-notch team here in Sydney but we’ve also been able to benefit from having investors in Silicon Valley who understand the vision and want to achieve the same thing as us, which is to have a massive impact.” Canva started life in 2007 when Ms Perkins founded the company as a student at the University of Western Australia and it now has almost 12 million users who have made over 85 million designs. The firm launched an iPhone app earlier this year that was seen onstage at this week’s iPhone 7 announcement. Canva was approached for comment.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Google buys cloud specialty firm Apigee for USD625 mn APIs "are vital for how business gets done today in the fast-growing digital and mobile marketplace," Google senior vice president Diane Greene said in a blog post about the acquisition. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Google today announced a deal to pay USD 625 million for Apigee, a firm specialising in managing the application programming interfaces, or APIs, that businesses use to connect with customers online. APIs "are vital for how business gets done today in the fast-growing digital and mobile marketplace," Google senior vice president Diane Greene said in a blog post about the acquisition. "They're the hubs through which companies, partners and customers interact, whether it's a small business applying online for a loan or a point-of-sale system sending your warranty information to the manufacturer," she added. For example, APIs can enable a business's computer networks to communicate with apps on smartphones or tablets. Apigee is used by hundreds of companies, including AT&T, Bechtel, Burberry, Live Nation and Walgreens, according to Google. Adding Apigee to its team promises to raise Google's game against major competitors Amazon and Microsoft in the market to provide businesses with services in the internet cloud. Forrester, the independent market-research company, last year predicted that annual global spending on API management would top USD 1 billion by 2020. "The transition toward cloud, mobile and digital interaction with customers and partners via APIs is happening, and fast," Greene said. The acquisition is subject to approval by regulators and Apigee shareholders but is expected to be completed this year. "We've entered a new era of cloud computing, where enterprises are increasingly running business-critical applications in the cloud," Apigee chief executive Chet Kapoor said in a release.

Electricity. The internal combustion engine. The internet. But if you ask a hungry Virginia Tech student, she might say that all those pale in comparison to what will be happening on that campus in the coming weeks: drone-delivered burritos. That's right -- Google is teaming up with Chipotle to deliver piping hot burritos by drone. It doesn't get much better than this, folks. In IT Blogwatch, we place an order. Let's get right to the important stuff. Where can we get a burrito? Stephanie Condon gives us the background: Google's Project Wing will test out delivering Chipotle burritos at Virginia Tech. ... The temporary, experimental service will begin this month...With a human pilot standing by...the self-guided, unmanned aircrafts will take food from a Chipotle food truck to volunteer customers and lower it down with a winch. So we just have to go to Virginia Tech and volunteer? No problem. But what is the motive behind this undertaking (besides getting tasty burritos into the hands of students)? Kurt Schlosser has the details: The FAA-approved venture...is aimed at convincing the FAA that delivery drones can safely navigate the skies...and avoid running into each other -- dropping your pizza or burrito or future Amazon order of hair gel onto unsuspecting heads below. ... Virginia Tech president Timothy Sands said...that the project is part of the school’s efforts to become a leader in new transportation technology. But why burritos? Google X's Astro Teller explains the reasoning behind it: Now, you might be wondering how we decided to deliver food...our goal is to maximize learning, and food delivery poses...operating challenges that few other testing scenarios have. A lunchtime rush of burrito orders will crank up the operational pressure of multiple orders coming in during a short period...We’ll...test how to package sensitive cargo and how well it endures the journey...In future tests, we could add a broader range of items, like drinks, which will push us to handle more weight, keep packages carefully balanced, and manage combinations of items on a single flight. So, what is really important with this whole burrito/drone thing? Hannah Kuchler knows it all boils down to one thing: You can get your burrito delivered by drone. But you still have to pay extra for guac. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Business Home LBoard Dr Mahathir won’t be attending Bersih 5 rally FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US EU copyright overhaul sparks cultural ‘apocalypse’ warnings AFP | September 9, 2016 Another change would force internet portals such as Google or Reddit to pay newspaper publishers a licence fee when using small extracts or snippets of news content -- most notably on Google News or Huffington Post. BRUSSELS: Is the EU, with Brexit and migration already in its cross-hairs, about to launch war on Europe’s digital start-ups and entertainers? The commission, the EU’s powerful executive arm, is preparing to unveil a radical overhaul of copyright law in Europe, a leaked draft of which has already attracted the fury of artists and investors who see it as a threat to European culture and innovation. Across the 28-nation European Union, production of books, music, newspapers and cinema is very much separated into national spheres and the commission, led by the federalist Jean-Claude Juncker, is driven to bring them closer. To do so, the EU will next week unveil a controversial revamp of copyright laws that will include several bold proposals to change the way content, including big ticket sports games, are both accessed and paid for in Europe, according to the draft seen by AFP. But film producers and sports leagues are dead set against the changes, arguing that entertainment on the continent should not become pan-European, but continue to be channelled through national markets. ‘Buy one, get 27 free’ One of the most divisive proposals is a push to make national broadcasters, such as Sky in the UK or RTL in Germany, to provide online content — including films or sports — Europe-wide, instead of just at home. “I can’t see how you can abolish geo-blocking and continue to protect copyright,” Martin Moszkowicz, of Germany’s Constantin Film told the Hollywood Reporter, referring to web users that are denied access to content from their home websites when outside their country. For broadcasters “it becomes a buy one (EU territory), get 27 for free. It would be catastrophic for all creative industries,” added Moszkowicz, a producer of the hugely popular Resident Alien films. Film producers also warn that geo-blocking is crucial to financing European cinema, which survives on national subsidies that are often financed by the success of Hollywood blockbusters. But consumer advocates dismiss the criticism as exaggerated. “This is not a choice between the current bad situation and the apocalypse the content providers describe,” said Agustin Reyna of BEUC, the European consumer organisation. Another change would force internet portals such as Google or Reddit to pay newspaper publishers a licence fee when using small extracts or snippets of news content — most notably on Google News or Huffington Post. Critics say this idea is highly ineffective, as proven when both Germany and Spain granted similar payments with neither case producing the badly needed life support to starved newspapers. “We believe ancillary copyright is bad, full stop, no matter how you look at it,” said Diana Cocoru, head of Policy at OpenForum Europe, a Google-backed lobby group that promotes an open internet. In addition, “the term of protection is incredibly long: 20 years,” she added. ‘Devastating effects’ In another highly criticised change, the commission is asking that video platforms, such as Youtube or even Facebook, use technology that can track violations of copyright and shut them down. “This law would have devastating effects on European startups,” said MEP Julia Reda, a key figure in European Parliament on digital matters. If the popular music site SoundCloud “had to comply with such onerous restrictions when they launched, they would have likely been overtaken by a non-EU-based competitor who didn’t,” she said on her blog. This law would also stop everyday citizens from posts that included copyrighted content, like a hit song played at a wedding or photos of the latest teen heart-throb. It comes “with no safeguards for citizens and at the expense of fundamental rights such as freedom of expression,” said OpenForum Europe’s Cocoru. But cracking down on Google-owned Youtube is a key demand of some the world’s biggest music artists — including Coldplay and Lady Gaga — who said in a letter to Juncker last June that Youtube was stealing value from streaming services, such as Spotify. The new copyright law “is a unique opportunity for Europe’s leaders to address the value gap,” the letter said. The package of proposals will prove to be highly contentious and is due to be released by the Commission on September 14. It would then go to the European Parliament and EU states for approval, which could take months, if not years, given the push back.

San Jose-based Apigee's software helps companies' digital services interact with apps used by customers and partners. The service is critical for businesses transitioning to the cloud, Diane Greene, who runs Google's cloud computing division, said in an interview. "They are a leader in this application programming interface area," she said. Cloud computing is the increasingly popular practice of using remote internet servers to store, manage and process data. Apigee specializes in managing so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, the channels through which digital services connect when a company logs a purchase for a customer or places an order with a supplier. Google will pay Apigee shareholders $17.40 for each share, a 6.5 percent premium to the stock's Wednesday close. Apigee's shares were slightly above the offer price at $17.43 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading on Thursday. The company, whose customers include AT&T, Burberry Group Plc, Vodafone Group Plc and the World Bank, went public in April last year at $17 per share. Greene, a former VMware CEO, has pushed to raise Google's profile in corporate computing since she joined last year. During her tenure, Google has streamlined engineering efforts and appointed new leadership for its cloud efforts, improving traction with clients, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call. Greene predicted that the Apigee acquisition would redouble Google's momentum. "Our customer lists are extremely complimentary," she said. "There's some overlap and some areas where we are going to be able to help each other once [the deal] closes." The Apigee deal comes a day after Google and online storage company Box Inc said they would partner to enable Box's corporate customers to integrate Google's suite of word processing, spreadsheets and other productivity tools, known as Google Docs. Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp, IBM Corp and others are vying for a share of the fast-growing corporate cloud computing business. Apigee, with high-profile clients in a strategically important area, will help Google close in on the competition, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. "Google has fallen behind both Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services in enterprise cloud computing, and this move is intended to strengthen that position," he wrote in an email.

France called on the United Nations Security Council to quickly face the issue, AP reports. The French presidency says “the international community must unite against this new provocation.” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault says Friday’s test is a “serious act which infringes the world’s peace and security.” He says “this escalation is unacceptable.” Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende also condemned Pyongyang’s nuclear test, saying in a tweet that “this unacceptable action causes deep concern & threatens peace.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.21am EDT 03:21 Nuclear test deeply troubling and regrettable - UN watchdog North Korea’s latest and fifth nuclear test, if confirmed, is “deeply troubling and regrettable”, the head of the UN atomic watchdog said. “This is in clear violation of numerous UN Security Council resolutions and in complete disregard of the repeated demands of the international community,” said Yukiya Amano, chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency. “It is a deeply troubling and regrettable act,” Amano said in a statement. “The Agency continues to closely follow the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear issue. We remain ready to contribute to its peaceful resolution by resuming our verification activities in the country once a political agreement is reached among countries concerned.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.07am EDT 03:07 South Korea’s intelligence agency is concerned that North Korea is advancing faster to miniaturize warheads on missiles, a lawmaker said after receiving an agency briefing on the North’s latest nuclear test. Kim Byung-kee, a member of the South Korean parliament’s intelligence committee, cited the spy agency as saying the North’s nuclear test was intended to project a strong image of its leader, Kim Jong Un, on the anniversary of the country’s 1948 foundation as a republic, as well as defy international sanctions.

First up, we have more from Reuters on the impact the nuclear test has had on Asian stock markets, and is likely to have on European markets. Asian shares extended losses after North Korea conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test on Friday, heightening geopolitical tensions in the region at a time when investors are grappling with slowing global growth. Stocks were already on the back foot when the North Korean news rattled markets, with uncertainty over the prospect of further easing from the European Central Bank pressuring global equities and bonds. European shares look set to follow Asia lower, with financial spreadbetters expecting Britain’s FTSE 100, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 to all open down 0.1 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.5 percent after touching a 13-month high on Thursday. The decline shrank gains for the week to 2.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei closed flat after pulling back earlier on reports of the North Korean nuclear test. It up 0.2 percent for the week. South Korea’s KOSPI also extended losses on its neighbour’s nuclear activity. After opening 0.7 percent lower, it was last trading down 1.3 percent from Thursday’s close. China’s CSI 300 index was 0.25 percent lower, and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.2 percent. They are set for gains of 0.7 percent and 1 percent, respectively, for the week.

North Koreans in Pyongyang watch a news report on Friday about the nuclear test. Photograph: Jon Chol Jin/AP The regime has conducted a lot more missile tests this year, the latest coming earlier this week as world leaders gathered in China for the G20. Combined with today’s nuclear warhead test, the statement claimed a technological advance enabling the explosive to be fitted to the missile. The test had: finally examined and confirmed the structure and specific features of movement of a nuclear warhead that has been standardized to be able to be mounted on strategic ballistic rockets. The standardization of the nuclear warhead will enable [North Korea] to produce at will and as many as it wants a variety of smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear warheads of higher strike power with a firm hold on the production of various fissile materials and technology for their use. This has definitely put on a higher level [the North’s] technology of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic rockets. South Koreans watch a North Korean TV report on Friday.

North Korea state television confirms nuclear test Updated at 2.32am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.55am EDT 01:55 Tom Phillips Adam Cathcart, a North Korea and China expert from Leeds University, says today’s test “arrives at a peculiar moment for the government in Beijing and presents both a political and propaganda challenge for how they respond”. Cathcart adds: Because Chinese state media has so heavily criticised South Korea’s plans for anti-missile deployment (THAAD), the temptation will be to say, ‘We told you so,’ arguing that South Korea effectively was the provocative actor that forced North Korea into a corner. Of course this would be to ignore the orgy of actual missile launches from North Korea. But since – according to the Chinese Communist party – Seoul has ‘opened Pandora’s box’ with the help of the USA, there exists plenty of rhetorical space for blame-shifting. Asked how China might respond, Cathcart added: After the well-worn phrases comes the bargaining at the UN – but I don’t see much appetite for sanctions that bite deeper in terms of China’s flow of trade along the shared border.

The foreign ministry in Beijing said on Friday that it was “resolutely opposed to North Korea’s latest nuclear test and strongly urges North Korea to stop taking any actions that will worsen the situation”.

Here are the key points: The test “examined and confirmed” specific features of a nuclear warhead designed to be mounted on ballistic missiles There was no radioactive leakage or adverse environmental impact caused by the test. The test elevated the country’s nuclear arsenal and was part of its response to the international sanctions following its earlier nuclear test and long-range rocket launch in January and February. It showed the country was ready to hit back if provoked by enemies including the United States, and that it would continue its efforts to strengthen the quantity and quality of its nuclear weapons.

State TV said the North was “now capable of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic rockets” South Korea said the explosion at 9am local time (1.30am BST) was the biggest of the North’s five tests so far with a yield of 10 kilotonnes.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.59am EDT 00:59 As promised, world affairs editor Julian Borger has filed his analysis of the situation. He says that today’s test could force the US back to the negotiating table with North Korea. The game-changer seems to be that the increasing number of tests shows the North could put a small warhead on a ballistic missile and therefore in theory attack another country. Here’s an excerpt from Julian’s piece: Until two years ago the conventional wisdom on the North’s nuclear programme was that it was largely a political symbol of the country’s potency and a bargaining chip for economic and diplomatic benefits. Since 2014 however the pace of nuclear and missile testing has accelerated, to the point where some experts now believe the country’s scientists have developed a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a missile. “It is likely now that North Korea could at this point put a nuclear warhead on a short or medium range missile which could reach South Korea, Japan and US military installations in the region,” said Kelsey Davenport, the director for non-proliferation policy at the Arms Control Association. However she thought it would be up to another decade before Pyongyang developed a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US. “All this activity is aimed at expanding the size of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and expanding its delivery options,” Davenport said. “It is taking steps to quality-improve its missiles, using solid fuel so they can be deployed more quickly, and extending their range. The trajectory points to a growing North Korean nuclear threat and the next US administration will have to prioritise that threat.” Read the full article here: North Korea's growing nuclear arsenal could force US back to negotiating table Read more Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.54am EDT 00:54 More on North Korea’s confirmation.

Astro Teller, playfully referred to as the 'Captain of Moonshots' at an X lab created at Google to pursue big-vision projects such as drones and self-driving cars, said in a blog post that Project Wing team was ready to launch the test of a prototype drone delivery system. US officials announced last week that Alphabet is joining tests for drone deliveries, as the White House unveiled accelerated rulemaking for commercial unmanned aircraft operations. The Project Wing team at Alphabet is to try out delivering burritos made by Mexican food chain Chipotle by drone on a college campus ©Jason Redmond (AFP/File) Teller said that a Wing prototype is ready for testing and that the team will run hundreds of flights in Virginia over the course of several days to deliver lunches prepared in an on-site food truck by Mexican food chain Chipotle. "We want to learn how people feel when they’re receiving a package by air, and taking someone’s time and/or money changes things more than a little," Teller said. "And we want to feel the pressure of unexpected circumstances that show us how we can get better at loading and managing a fleet of planes." The Project Wing team opted to try out delivering food to create operating challenges including "a lunchtime rush of burrito orders" as well as having to get food to customers hot and in the right shape, according to Teller. "In future tests, we could add a broader range of items, like drinks, which will push us to handle more weight, keep packages carefully balanced, and manage combinations of items on a single flight," he added. He believes drones will be available within the next decade for important missions such as delivering medicine and other supplies to areas cut off by disasters and helping emergency responders battle wildfires. At a "White House Drone Day" event last week, officials announced steps toward expanding rules for drone operations, including for newsgathering and commercial flights over populated areas, after a first set of regulations unveiled in June. "We hope to propose a rule on unmanned aircraft operations over people by the end of this year," Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Huerta said. The government has registered more than 500,000 hobby drones in eight months, but sees a need for more rules for commercial operators, he added. The first set of rules stop short of allowing some long-sought applications, including delivery of goods by retailers like Amazon in populated areas. As the world's largest online retailer, Amazon raised eyebrows in late 2013 with its plan to airlift small parcels to customers by drone in select markets less than 30 minutes after orders are received. It has gone to other countries to test its evolving technology, and last month announced plans for test deliveries in Britain.
