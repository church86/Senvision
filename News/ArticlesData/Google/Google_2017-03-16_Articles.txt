(Supplied photo) - + Google Thailand is boosting its influence in the burgeoning mobile advertising market by giving small and medium-sized companies their own mobile websites on its mobile ad platform as the internet giant strives to increase ad revenue. In exchange for receiving a mobile website for free, companies must first sign up with Google's mobile ad service platform. "There are 270,000 SMEs in Thailand that have their own company websites, representing only 10% of the 2.7 million SMEs in the country," said Saranee Boonritthongchai, head for business-to-business (B2B) marketing. Too often, the websites of those SMEs that do have them were designed for desktop computers only, precluding mobile users from logging on or otherwise having a mobile-friendly experience, she said. Thailand is a mobile-first country with 50 million smartphone users, representing 70% of the population. "Having a mobile website will be an essential marketing tool for SMEs to increase their presence in the large online community," said Ghislain Chatelier, Google's director for Southeast Asia. SMEs are the key engine for stimulating Thailand's economic growth, contributing 40% of the country's GDP. Ms Saranee said Google had selected Thailand as one of several countries to offer the subsidised mobile ad programme to help local SMEs capitalise on the fast-growing mobile ad market, as well as boost Google's mobile ad revenue. Based on a study from Google Research via webpagestest.org, which relied on a sample of 900,000 websites globally, it found that the average time it takes to fully load a mobile landing page in Thailand is 12 seconds, compared with 10 seconds in developed countries. In addition, 53% of mobile website visitors leave a page that takes longer than three seconds to load. Another internal survey found that nearly 50% of the 870 respondents dislike waiting for slow pages to load, 16% are unhappy when an interstitial ad is shown, and 14% get upset when a video is unplayable. Google is offering a free online tool, testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com website, which allows people to test how long their websites take to load on mobile devices. The site also provides Google Trends, a data analytic tool that provides deep understanding of consumer behaviour and preferences, to help SMEs.

The ad seems to pop up when users ask for a rundown of their day, which kicks off the Home’s “My Day” feature. That feature is supposed to offer users information about the weather, their calendars and relevant news. But at the end of the rundown, the Google Assistant offered the following unsolicited tidbit, according to a video posted to Twitter by Bryson Meunier : “By the way, Disney’s live action 'Beauty and The Beast' opens today,” it says. “In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer, if you ask me. For some more movie fun, ask me something about Belle.” After users started talking about the message, Google put out a statement saying it “isn’t an ad.” A few hours later on Thursday, the company put out a second statement saying that the movie promotion “wasn’t intended to be an ad.” It’s unclear how the content was different from an advertisement, considering that it was a message inserted into users’ briefings with the aim of getting them to go see a movie. A Google representative didn’t respond when asked if Disney or another of its partners paid for the message placement. The “Beauty and the Beast” message has since been removed. “We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case,” Google’s second statement concluded. This incident highlights one of the possible future revenue streams for virtual assistants, as Meunier noted in his tweet. For example, Google and other virtual assistant makers could take payments in exchange for promoting certain results in response to users’ queries, in the same way search advertising works today. Companies have already tried to use virtual assistant integrations as marketing tools. NBC recently released a skill for Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant that lets users ask Alexa for information about upcoming guests on “The Tonight Show” and listen to host Jimmy Fallon’s monologue. Warner Bros. released a game for Alexa that lets users try to find out who killed Bruce Wayne’s parents as part of its promotion work for “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.” The big difference between those Alexa integrations and the Google Home ad is that users have to opt into the former and then choose to engage with them. By contrast, Google Home users weren’t asked whether they wanted to hear about “Beauty and the Beast." Thursday was a banner day for virtual assistant updates. On the same day, Amazon announced that Alexa will be available to iPhone users through the online retailer’s app. Subscribe here for up-to-date channel news Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the New Zealand Reseller News newsletter!

Although rising in popularity and usefulness, Google’s smart home hub and speaker is also rising in notoriety. First was the admittedly comical and fortunately harmless incident with its Super Bowl ad triggering speakers everywhere. Then there was the rather embarrassing fake news issue. This time, it’s ads. Users have reported, and recorded, Google Home blurting out an add for the opening of the live action Beauty and the Beast film. Google insists, however, that it was just an honest mistake and not the start of ads on Google Home. No, the speaker doesn’t suddenly speak out when not asked. The “advertisement”, which informs the user that the film has opened, was almost randomly inserted into Google Home’s routine response to a “tell me about my day” query. At least one owner, Search Engine Land author Bryson Meunier, recorded how Home interrupted its usual flow of information to interject the following: “By the way, Disney’s live action Beauty and The Beast opens today. In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer if you ask me. For some more movie fun, ask me something about Belle.” New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO — brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 Users are up in arms about this for two main reasons. The first is that it extends the time it takes for Google Home to complete its summary of the day’s highlights, which users have specifically enabled or disabled to suit their preference. To add insult to injury, the interruption comes right in the middle, not at the end. It’s as if Google Home suddenly remembered a non-sequitur trivia and decided to let you know, right in between the weather and the news. More worrisome for others, however, is the advertorial nature of the information. Some of the users insist they have never even made a Google search for the film or anything related to it. And still some are peeved that Google would randomly insert unrelated information in a section that some users consider sacrosanct. For its part, Google claims there was no advertising involved. It was technically a part of that same “My Day” feature that aims to provide helpful information about the day. Sometimes, it pulls in timely content such as this, though it doesn’t explain why this specific piece of information was chosen. Google does admit that it could have done better in how it surfaced “unique” content to users. Just like how it could have done better to make sure users don’t end up with fake news or misleading information. These incidents, however, do highlight some of the inherent issues of these smart speakers, where users have less control over what goes in or out of the devices, compared to smartphones, for example.

Do you think Google should have ads read by the Assistant? Google’s main source of revenue as a company is from advertisements. One of the company’s latest projects, Google Assistant, is a machine learning artificial intelligence bot that runs on the Google Home, Android Wear, and soon, most Android Marshmallow and Nougat handsets. The biggest problem that the company could be having is finding a way to monetize its newest project. Again, Google has said that this specific instance was not a form of advertisement but some believe that money had to have been exchanged to make this happen. While you cannot listen to the Assistant’s Beauty and the Beast speech anymore on the Home or Pixel, the question remains if Google plans to continue including similar messages and if they will ever monetize them. Are you against Google Assistant playing content that could come off as an advertisement? Answer the poll below and let us know your thoughts in the comments!

By Rachel Middleton Updated March 17, 2017 06:14 GMT Google Doodle marks St PatRick's Day 2017 with a trip to Skellig Michael ... with two lucky cloversGoogle doodle Google celebrates St Patrick's Day 2017 by taking its readers to the mystical Skellig Michael, a remote island just off the coast of County Kerry in Ireland. The animation, in green of course, shows two clovers sharing a high five on top of the island. The World Heritage Site is home to many species of seabirds, including puffins, gannets and razorbills. Google say: "If you're brave enough to scale the 600 steps to the top of the rocky precipice, you'll see a magnificent view of the mainland and the Atlantic Ocean from 714 feet above sea level. "The Skelligs are part of the Kerry Gaeltacht, where locals speak Irish, and you may hear 'Cead mile failte' or 'a hundred thousand welcomes,' if you visit," it adds. Skellig Michael is the larger of the two Skellig islands. Where is St Patrick's Day celebrated? St Patrick's Day, which falls on 17 March, honours the patron saint of Ireland but is celebrated around the world. In fact, since 1961 St Patrick is also regarded as the patron saint of Nigeria, which has around 20 million Catholics. It is not, however, celebrated as a national holiday there as it is in Ireland and Northern Ireland. It is also a national holiday on the island of Montserrat in the Caribbean. In the Canadian province of Newfoundland, St Patrick's Day is a provincial holiday. So who is St Patrick? Born Maewyn Succat in Roman Britain around 385 AD, he changed his name to Patrick when he became a bishop. Whether he is actually Irish is not really known. The Telegraph claims St Patrick was captured by pirates and taken to Ireland, where he was made to work as a herdsman. However, he managed to escape after six years and it is assumed that he returned to Britain, where he became a Christian priest. St Patrick then returned to Ireland as a missionary in the fifth century where he spent the next three decades setting up schools, churches and monasteries. He took over as the bishop of Ireland, replacing St Palladius. He is believed to have died on 17 March in 461 AD. But did you know that St Patrick's is not the only patron saint of Ireland? It also boasts two others - St Bridget is remembered on 1 February and St Columba on 9 June.

Inside the vicious patent fight over self-driving technology. by Max Chafkin More stories by Max Chafkin and Mark Bergen @mhbergen More stories by Mark Bergen March 16, 2017, 4:00 AM EDT From Subscribe Reprints Travis Kalanick, the chief executive officer of Uber Technologies Inc., says he needs leadership help. He recently dispatched former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate sexual harassment claims against the company. His security team is reviewing a practice known as “Greyballing.” And he’s no longer planning to go to meetings with President Trump. These damage-control initiatives—in response, respectively, to a leaked video in which Kalanick was rude to an Uber driver, a blog post by a former engineer, an admission that the company had been deliberately misleading police, and a customer boycott—were the result of a month’s worth of public-relations disasters. Taken alone, any of these would have been enough to slow down the famously fast-moving ride-hailing company. Taken together, they’ve caused some to question Uber’s viability and Kalanick’s staying power. But none of these scandals has the potential financial impact of the one Uber has said the least about: a lawsuit from Alphabet Inc.—the parent of Google and Google’s self-driving car division, now called Waymo—over driverless cars. Waymo says Uber is in possession of, and is basing the future of its business on, technology that was stolen by a former employee. Self-driving technology has become a fixation for Kalanick. Developing a driverless car, he’s often said, is “existential” to Uber. If a competitor managed to get there first, it could easily replicate Uber’s core service (shuttling passengers) without its single largest cost (paying drivers). Over the course of a few weeks in 2015, Kalanick poached 40 researchers from the Carnegie Mellon University robotics lab, one of the country’s top autonomous vehicle research centers. Then, last summer, Uber became the first company to operate a fleet of autonomous taxis, in downtown Pittsburgh. On the day it announced that service, Uber also said it had acquired Otto, a self-driving truck startup founded in January 2016 by a former Google employee, Anthony Levandowski. The 37-year-old engineer was an original member of Google’s car team and a protégé of its creator, Sebastian Thrun. Featured in Bloomberg Businessweek, March 20-26, 2017. Subscribe now. Illustration: Kurt Woerpel At Google, Levandowski had been both a brilliant engineer and a divisive manager, with a reputation for flouting corporate norms and skirting rules to get cars on the road as quickly as possible. He was so controversial, according to several former and current employees, that when he was being considered to lead the car team, a group of engineers revolted, causing Alphabet CEO Larry Page to rethink the choice and install a different leader, Chris Urmson. According to the legal complaint filed on behalf of Google’s driverless car division—as almost everyone at Waymo still refers to it—the company began investigating Levandowski last summer after learning that Uber had paid about $700 million for his months-old company. Google’s suit, filed in a San Francisco federal court, says its investigators uncovered a trove of digital evidence that hint at an unprecedented theft. According to the suit, Levandowski used his company laptop to download 14,000 design files from Google’s car project. He plugged a memory card reader into the laptop and, shortly afterward, wiped all the data from the laptop. The suit also alleges that two other Otto employees took files on their way out the door. Google seemed content to sit on that information until Dec. 13, when a Google employee received an email from a supplier that was working on components for the lidar sensor in the company’s first production car. Lidar—a portmanteau of “light” and “radar”—is the key component that allows an autonomous vehicle to, essentially, see its surroundings. (It’s also used to build maps.) Off-the-shelf sensors cost up to $80,000 and contain several individual lenses. Under Levandowski, who’d led the lidar team, Google developed a much cheaper version that used a single lens. Strangely, though, the email’s subject line—“Otto Files”— made reference to Levandowski’s company. According to Google’s suit, the contents of the email, which seemed to have been intended for Uber rather than Google, included a machine drawing of a lidar circuit board that had Otto’s name on it but looked almost identical to Google’s. Two months later, Waymo sued Uber for trade secret theft and patent infringement, seeking damages and an injunction that could seriously impede Uber’s self-driving car program. At issue is a business that both companies believe will be worth hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars a year. And though both companies like to portray driverless cars as some near-term inevitability, this dispute shows just how messy the race to get there could prove to be. During new-hire orientation, engineers at Google are frequently told that the company will never sue a former employee for patent infringement. The implication is twofold: first, that Google doesn’t stoop to fighting over patents, though it may employ them to protect itself from people who aren’t in the business of changing the world. (“These patent wars are death,” Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said at an event in 2012, calling patent litigation “bad for innovation.”) And, as an extension of that, if Google sues you over a patent issue, you must have really pissed them off. After the lawsuit was filed, Uber released a statement characterizing it as “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.” At an all-hands meeting at the company’s Pittsburgh research center, Levandowski defended Uber’s lidar technology as “clean”—that is, not the product of stolen design documents—and told the company’s engineers that he’d downloaded the files to work from home. Some former colleagues seem to think that even if Levandowski did what Google alleges, he doesn’t deserve to be punished. “Whatever Google may say about him stealing lidar trade secrets, he was the lidar team at Google,” says someone who worked at the company’s driverless car program. “This is like the Swiss patent office suing Einstein for inventing the theory of relativity while he worked there.” The comparison to Einstein is obviously hyperbolic, but it also captures the foundational role Levandowski played in the development of self-driving cars. Levandowski, 6-foot-6 and relentlessly intense, is as much an entrepreneur as he is an engineer. At 16 he started a web design firm that a former colleague says made him a millionaire by the end of high school. (Levandowski didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.) As a University of California at Berkeley undergraduate, he won a national competition sponsored by Lego—he built a toy robot that could sort Monopoly money. Levandowski was 22 and working toward an MBA and an industrial engineering master’s at Berkeley when he first heard about the Darpa Grand Challenge. (His mother read about it and mentioned it to him.) The 2004 competition, organized by the U.S. Department of Defense, involved a race for robotic cars on a 150-mile course in the Mojave Desert. It drew teams from Carnegie Mellon, the California Institute of Technology, a number of defense contractors, and most of the other big names in robotics. Levandowski led a ragtag team of Berkeley graduate students and research assistants. Levandowski. At Otto, a running joke was “Safety third.” Illustration: Sally Thurer; Photographer: Tony Avelar/AP Images If there was hubris in entering, there was even more in his chosen design. Ghostrider, his self-balancing, self-driving motorcycle, was the only two-wheel vehicle in the contest. “I was assuming the driving part would be easy to solve,” he said last summer, speaking to Bloomberg Businessweek in a joint interview with Kalanick shortly before Uber announced its acquisition of Otto. “I wanted to make something actually difficult.” Although it failed to stay upright on race day—a grainy YouTube video documenting Ghostrider’s run is six seconds long—the bike was still seen as an achievement by Levandowski’s peers, partly because no team finished. (Ghostrider eventually became part of the Smithsonian’s permanent collection.) For the next competition, in 2005, Levandowski served as the team leader for Ghostrider while also working on lidar sensors for the winning team from Stanford, which was managed by Thrun. Levandowski and two Berkeley friends adapted the technology from Ghostrider, which had used GPS and cheap digital cameras, into a commercial product. Their company, 510 Systems LLC, sold camera systems, and eventually lidar, to mapping companies, including Nokia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. Levandowski also sold kits to automate agricultural and construction equipment. In 2007, Google hired Thrun’s team from Stanford to work on a new product, Street View, formally making Levandowski a full-time employee of the search company even as he continued to run 510. The initial plan was to supplement Google’s maps, which at the time used data licensed from the mapping giant Navteq Corp., with pictures of city streets. Levandowski suggested that Thrun’s mapping technology could allow Google to replace Navteq’s data altogether. His mapping initiative was seen as an enormous success, allowing Google to offer on phones turn-by-turn driving directions that were as good as those offered by standalone GPS device makers. In 2008, while doing double-duty at Google and 510, he took a call from a producer at the Discovery Channel who wanted to borrow Ghostrider for an episode of Prototype This!, a short-lived documentary series. Levandowski suggested instead that he use a different vehicle. He asked Google for permission to embark on the stunt using sensors similar to those on Google’s mapping cars. It was granted on the condition that Levandowski, and not Google, would be responsible if something went wrong. “The lawyers said, ‘Absolutely, but please don’t put Google on the side,’ ” Levandowski told Bloomberg Businessweek in the interview last summer. “So we started this thing called Anthony’s Robots to be very clear it wasn’t Google-related.” A few weeks later, under a police escort and with cameras rolling, the Pribot, as Levandowski named his converted Toyota Prius, successfully crossed the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Google’s self-driving car project began the following year with a modified Prius that used software created by Thrun at Stanford and hardware supplied by Anthony’s Robots. Like 510 Systems, Anthony’s Robots was operated as an independent company. The arrangement—whereby Levandowski was at once a founding member of the Google self-driving car team and a vendor who was also selling technology to other companies—was well-known to Google executives, though it was never publicly disclosed. “Anthony is a rogue force of nature,” says a former Google self-driving car executive. “Each phase of his Google career he had a separate company doing exactly the same work.” According to two former Google employees, founders Page and Sergey Brin tolerated Levandowski’s freelancing because they saw it as the fastest way to make progress. Google’s car team embraced Levandowski’s nature, too. The attitude, says a former colleague, was “he’s an asshole, but he’s our asshole.” As Google’s car project grew, a debate raged inside the company, reflecting a broader dispute about the direction of autonomous vehicles: Should the tech come gradually and be added to cars with drivers (through features like automatic parking and highway autopilot) or all at once (for instance, a fleet of fully autonomous cars operating in a city center)? Urmson, a former Carnegie Mellon professor, preferred the latter approach, arguing that incremental innovations might, paradoxically, make cars less safe. Levandowski believed otherwise and argued that Google should sell self-driving kits that could be retrofitted on cars, former colleagues say. Urmson won out, and according to two former employees, Levandowski sulked openly. After one dispute between the two, Levandowski stopped coming to work for months, devoting his time to his side projects. This didn’t stop Page and Brin from discreetly acquiring 510 Systems and Anthony’s Robots for roughly $50 million in 2011. As Google’s driverless car program matured, Levandowski seemed to become impatient. Creating a fully functioning driverless car means training a complicated hardware and software system to identify lane lines and red lights and to control the car’s movements. It also means writing software that anticipates thousands of unlikely “edge cases”—hairpin turns, drivers who use hand signals, covered bridges, recumbent bikes, and so on. That work seemed to bore Levandowski. He became increasingly frustrated at Google’s inability to operate its cars on city streets and decided to take matters into his own hands. “Engineers were like, ‘We are totally ready to go,’ and I’m like, ‘Let’s go then. Let’s see whether it’s real or a demo,’ ” Levandowski said in the summer interview. Without formally telling Google, which considered its cars not yet ready for open-road tests, he hired a lobbyist in Nevada and wrote a law that allowed companies to test autonomous cars with so-called safety drivers. (Self-driving car companies use the term to describe an engineer who sits in the driver’s seat with her hands on the wheel in case the car malfunctions.) The law passed at the end of 2011, though Google hasn’t conducted large-scale tests in the state. Google’s government relations department learned about Levandowski’s Nevada efforts when the lobbyist, David Goldwater, sent the company an invoice. Levandowski first met Kalanick in 2011 at a TED conference, but the two didn’t become close until early 2016, after Levandowski pitched Kalanick on an investment in Otto. Kalanick didn’t invest—but he did begin meeting with Levandowski in secret. In the interview with Bloomberg Businessweek at the time of the acquisition, Kalanick described these rendezvous in detail: The two would go to the San Francisco Ferry Building after sunset, entering separately and each picking up takeout food. They’d begin walking west toward the Golden Gate Bridge, where they’d eventually join up and begin talking. Kalanick recalled that he and Levandowski went on five or so of these walks, each one lasting several hours. Kalanick, now 40, was taken by the younger man’s hustle and sense of purpose, describing him as a “brother from another mother.” To get self-driving cars to production, Kalanick said in the interview, “it can’t just be about science. It has to be about engineering and entrepreneurialism that takes us into the real world. That’s where Anthony and I connect, right?” Levandowski, who was sitting next to him, nodded. “We think very similarly in terms of how do we get things out onto the world fastest,” he said. “How do we make a difference, how do we make impact, how do we get people using our technology.” Levandowski hinted that he’d decided to break with Google and start Otto in part out of frustration at the slow pace of innovation at Google. That might not have been the whole story. On March 10, Google, which is seeking a preliminary injunction to stop Uber from using its technology, filed written testimony from Pierre-Yves Droz, Levandowski’s co-founder at 510 Systems and the technical lead on Google’s lidar program. Droz wrote that in the summer of 2015 Levandowski said Uber might be interested in “buying the team” and that in January 2016 he told Droz he would “replicate” the company’s lidar. When Levandowski quit to start Otto, he was escorted out by Google security. A handful of Google employees soon followed him to the new company. Soon after, Levandowski began making trips to Uber’s self-driving car research center in Pittsburgh, where a staff that had grown to 500 was scrambling to launch the pilot taxi service. Levandowski wasn’t widely introduced; senior managers believed he was a consultant. “As far as the team knew,” says a former employee, Levandowski was “some guy who would come around and be annoying.” At Otto’s San Francisco headquarters, the startup, which had 90 or so employees, prepared for its product launch in May. Down a stretch of Nevada highway, the company ran a self-driving big-rig truck kitted out with sensors and computer controllers. Documents uncovered by the tech publication Backchannel showed that Levandowksi had sought the approval of state regulators to film the demo. When they denied his request to do the run, he went through with it anyway. (Goldwater, again serving as Levandowski’s lobbyist, argued in an email to the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles that it had no jurisdiction in the matter. A senior DMV administrator called the test “illegal” in an internal email but declined to rebuke Otto publicly.) In August, Uber acquired Otto for roughly $700 million in company stock. The plan, Kalanick said, was to continue building Otto’s trucking business and to use the startup’s homegrown lidar to beef up Uber’s own self-driving cars, all under Levandowski’s supervision. Uber’s Pittsburgh team learned of the acquisition, and the fact that they had a new boss, the day it was announced. “The team was super unhappy,” says a former employee. It turned out that Otto’s lidar was a work in progress—the company’s prototype trucks were still using sensors manufactured by Velodyne Lidar Inc. “We thought we were getting some supersecret sauce by joining them,” says the employee. “But they did smoke and mirrors and got a huge acquisition offer.” Over the next six months, about 15 of the original 40 Carnegie Mellon engineers left. At least three have subsequently founded competing self-driving car companies, one of which recently received a $1 billion investment over five years from Ford Motor Co. Levandowski seemed to struggle in other ways as well. In December, Uber dispatched 16 self-driving cars, with safety drivers, in San Francisco without seeking a permit from the California DMV. The test went poorly—on the first day, a self-driving car ran a red light, and the DMV ordered Uber to halt its program in the state. The company suffered further embarrassment when a New York Times article, citing leaked documents, suggested that Uber’s explanation for the traffic violation—that it had been caused by human error—wasn’t complete. The car malfunctioned, and the driver failed to stop it. The misdirection came as no surprise to the Uber employees who’d spent time at Otto’s San Francisco headquarters. Someone there had distributed stickers—in OSHA orange—with a tongue-in-cheek slogan: “Safety third.” In Silicon Valley, litigation is looked upon as the last refuge of the undisruptive Uber has yet to file a legal response to Google’s complaint—a spokeswoman says it plans to do so later this month—but the company essentially has two options: It can settle with Waymo and license its sensors, or it can fight. “What Waymo probably wants is to license its patents to Uber,” says Robert Gomulkiewicz, a former Microsoft intellectual-property lawyer who’s now a professor at the University of Washington School of Law. “In this kind of litigation, that’s the typical sequence of events.” That said, this isn’t a typical patent dispute, and Uber isn’t a typical company. If it fights, it could argue, as Levandowski did at the all-hands meeting in Pittsburgh, that the alleged document dump was simply part of an effort on his part to work from home. It could also cite how Google seemed to encourage Levandowski’s freelance excursions. And while many of his former colleagues assume that Google wouldn’t sue Levandowski if the forensic evidence wasn’t incontrovertible—that is, if it didn’t have him dead to rights—other former colleagues and some industry insiders see the lawsuit as evidence that Google is struggling to make up for its failure to bring a product to market quickly. “Google is the Xerox Parc of self-driving cars,” says George Hotz, the founder of Comma.ai, another autonomous car startup. It’s a backhanded compliment: Although Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center invented the modern computer operating system, it didn’t bring the invention to market; Apple Inc. did. “The real question is, why hasn’t Google shipped?” Hotz asks. He regards Google’s lawsuit as a deliberate conflation of two different beefs. The first—the accusation that Levandowski stole documents—is serious. The second, Hotz says, “just signals weakness on Google’s part.” In Silicon Valley, and at the Googleplex, litigation is looked upon as the last refuge of the undisruptive. Whatever Levandowski did with Google’s files, he’s not wrong that Google has struggled to commercialize technology that’s widely regarded as the best in the automotive industry. Before Google worked on its current prototype, a two-seater that has a top speed of 20 miles per hour and vaguely resembles a koala bear, the company pitched Elon Musk on outfitting his electric Tesla vehicles with Google tech, according to two people familiar with the deal. Musk passed and a few years later launched Tesla Inc.’s highway autopilot service on his own. A former Google executive says John Krafcik, who joined the car project as CEO in 2015, would sometimes appear rattled by the competitive moves of Tesla and Uber, wondering aloud if Google may have already been “leapfrogged.” He would grow particularly irritable “every time Elon would post something on Twitter,” the executive says. Levandowski hasn’t shown any sign of being rattled or contrite. Three days after the lawsuit hit, he appeared onstage in Barcelona as a marquee speaker at the Mobile World Congress. The lawsuit never came up. As a final question, the moderator, the chief marketing officer of a cell phone industry trade group, simply asked, “Do you drive?” Levandowski smiled. “Sometimes I drive, and sometimes I’m driven,” he said. “That’s the beauty of being able to work on this project—you get to see the technology evolve and get better over time.” “Absolutely fascinating stuff,” the moderator replied. “Please, everyone: a round of applause for Anthony.” The crowd, stacked with top executives from the world’s biggest companies, complied enthusiastically. —With Dana Hull and Ashlee Vance Watch This Next: Uber CEO Kalanick Caught on Video Arguing Over Fares Uber CEO Kalanick Caught on Video Arguing Over Fares     Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

Tech giants are responding with content and ads meant specifically for mobile devices. Eric Jhonsa Mar 16, 2017 4:38 PM EDT Over the last few years, we've seen Alphabet/Google (GOOGL) , Facebook (FB) and others put a lot of effort into creating text and photo-based ad formats optimized for smartphones. Recognizing that a 5-inch touchscreen device that's with a user at all times has different strengths and weaknesses as an advertising medium than desktops and notebooks, Google/Facebook launched things such as app install ads, search ads with expanded text, local business ads that are targeted based on a user's location and shopping ads featuring listings that a user can swipe through. In recent months, Internet giants have begun realizing that video content (including ads) needs to be optimized for mobile viewing as well. In many cases, there could be a sizable payoff as mobile video traffic continues swelling. On Wednesday, Netflix (NFLX) exec Neil Hunt said his company is thinking of providing mobile-specific cuts of its original movies and shows. According to The Verge, Netflix's goal would be to "create a version of [its] content with scenes or shots that are more easily visible or immersive on a mobile phone, since certain shots can be hard to see or can appear diminished on a relatively small phone screen." Hunt suggested Netflix's expansion into dozens of international markets, including Asian markets where a majority of its viewing takes place on mobile devices, is influencing its thinking. Likewise, Netflix's launches within markets where high-speed mobile connections can be limited and/or expensive contributed to its recent decision to start making some content available for download/offline viewing on its iOS and Android apps. Meanwhile, Google's YouTube, which is filled to the brim with mobile-friendly short-form videos, announced last month it's killing off its unskippable 30-second video ad format, which wasn't a good fit for the shorter attention spans many smartphone users have. Instead, YouTube will continue supporting shorter unskippable ads, including the 6-second Bumper ads (launched last spring) it has argued are ideal for improving an advertiser's mobile reach.

The ad seems to pop up when users ask for a rundown of their day, which kicks off the Home’s “My Day” feature. That feature is supposed to offer users information about the weather, their calendars and relevant news. But at the end of the rundown, the Google Assistant offered the following unsolicited tidbit, according to a video posted to Twitter by Bryson Meunier : “By the way, Disney’s live action 'Beauty and The Beast' opens today,” it says. “In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer, if you ask me. For some more movie fun, ask me something about Belle.” After users started talking about the message, Google put out a statement saying it “isn’t an ad.” A few hours later on Thursday, the company put out a second statement saying that the movie promotion “wasn’t intended to be an ad.” It’s unclear how the content was different from an advertisement, considering that it was a message inserted into users’ briefings with the aim of getting them to go see a movie. A Google representative didn’t respond when asked if Disney or another of its partners paid for the message placement. The “Beauty and the Beast” message has since been removed. “We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case,” Google’s second statement concluded. This incident highlights one of the possible future revenue streams for virtual assistants, as Meunier noted in his tweet. For example, Google and other virtual assistant makers could take payments in exchange for promoting certain results in response to users’ queries, in the same way search advertising works today. Companies have already tried to use virtual assistant integrations as marketing tools. NBC recently released a skill for Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant that lets users ask Alexa for information about upcoming guests on “The Tonight Show” and listen to host Jimmy Fallon’s monologue. Warner Bros. released a game for Alexa that lets users try to find out who killed Bruce Wayne’s parents as part of its promotion work for “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.” The big difference between those Alexa integrations and the Google Home ad is that users have to opt into the former and then choose to engage with them. By contrast, Google Home users weren’t asked whether they wanted to hear about “Beauty and the Beast." Thursday was a banner day for virtual assistant updates. On the same day, Amazon announced that Alexa will be available to iPhone users through the online retailer’s app. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Each week, we select the top stories and present them in our free weekly newsletter, BotBeat. We include news stories by VentureBeat staff, guest articles from leading figures in the bots community, and a good number of posts from a wide variety of other outlets. You can subscribe to our BotBeat newsletter to receive this information in your inbox every Thursday. Here’s this week’s newsletter: The enterprise chat wars are exploding. Last week, Google launched a beta version of Hangouts Chat and just two days ago, Microsoft released Teams in 181 countries and 19 languages. The moves by these 800 pound gorillas imperil companies like Slack, Yammer, and Hipchat — the very companies that pioneered the enterprise chat space. Yet the giants are taking different approaches. With its 85 million Office 365 users, Microsoft has aready-made market to sell its service. Companies wanting the chat and group collaboration functionality are going to have to pay. Google, as Ken Yeung writes, is taking a page from Slack’s playbook by “establishing a platform to not only be a place to hold discussions, but to quickly jump into video calling when needed.” Hangouts Chat is marketed as a free service, available as part of companies’ G-suite subscriptions. So, a different approach to the same goal of charging businesses. Google and Microsoft are not alone in their enterprise focus. For instance, Facebook offers Workplace and Cisco has Spark. These big tech companies are now pushing enterprise chat and group collaboration, with bots as a service. Sure it’s an old war for enterprise market share, but now group chat has been weaponized to be integrated into an operating system and a host of applications. If that’s what determines victory, then perhaps first movers like Slack never had achance. As always, please send news tips to Khari Johnson and guest post submissions to John Brandon.

By Blair Hanley Frank U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 17, 2017 4:55 AM PT Credit: Jon Phillips More like this Hey Alexa, what are your competitors doing? 9 must-know Amazon Echo tips and tricks Amazon Echo gains support for Outlook calendars Video Hands-on with Visa's NFC sunglasses Google Home users got a surprise on Thursday when their virtual assistants cheerily mentioned that the live-action remake of “Beauty and the Beast” is opening in theaters this weekend. The ad seems to pop up when users ask for a rundown of their day, which kicks off the Home’s “My Day” feature. That feature is supposed to offer users information about the weather, their calendars and relevant news. But at the end of the rundown, the Google Assistant offered the following unsolicited tidbit, according to a video posted to Twitter by Bryson Meunier. “By the way, Disney’s live action ‘Beauty and The Beast’ opens today,” it says. “In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer, if you ask me. For some more movie fun, ask me something about Belle.” After users started talking about the message, Google put out a statement saying it “isn’t an ad.” A few hours later on Thursday, the company put out a second statement saying that the movie promotion “wasn’t intended to be an ad.” It’s unclear how the content was different from an advertisement, considering that it was a message inserted into users’ briefings with the aim of getting them to go see a movie. A Google representative didn’t respond when asked if Disney or another of its partners paid for the message placement. The “Beauty and the Beast” message has since been removed. “We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case,” Google’s second statement concluded. This incident highlights one of the possible future revenue streams for virtual assistants, as Meunier noted in his tweet. For example, Google and other virtual assistant makers could take payments in exchange for promoting certain results in response to users’ queries, in the same way search advertising works today. Companies have already tried to use virtual assistant integrations as marketing tools. NBC recently released a skill for Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant that lets users ask Alexa for information about upcoming guests on “The Tonight Show” and listen to host Jimmy Fallon’s monologue. Warner Bros. released a game for Alexa that lets users try to find out who killed Bruce Wayne’s parents as part of its promotion work for “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.” The big difference between those Alexa integrations and the Google Home ad is that users have to opt into the former and then choose to engage with them. By contrast, Google Home users weren’t asked whether they wanted to hear about “Beauty and the Beast.” Thursday was a banner day for virtual assistant updates. On the same day, Amazon announced that Alexa will be available to iPhone users through the online retailer’s app. To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

A program called AlphaGo beat the reigning human world champion at go, an ancient Chinese board game considered to be one of the most complex pastimes man has ever devised. The game has remained an inviolably human pursuit for centuries, and one of the hardest challenges for artificial intelligence (AI) because of the vast number of possible moves — more than the number of atoms in the universe — and the need to employ creativity to win. In Seoul’s Four Seasons hotel, AlphaGo’s victory over five games was ruthless: Lee Sedol, the 33-year-old human go grandmaster, lost 4-1. At a press conference afterwards, he said with a trace of wonder: “Today, I am speechless.” Just two months earlier, AlphaGo had been featured on the cover of Nature, the premier peer-reviewed scientific journal, having defeated the human European go champion 5-0. That and its triumph over Lee cemented its position as a rare scientific breakthrough that came years ahead of scientists’ predictions. AlphaGo takes on and beats go grandmaster Lee Sedol © Getty “This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away,” the team behind it wrote. AlphaGo is the brainchild of DeepMind Technologies, a London-based AI company acquired by Google in 2014 for £400m. The AlphaGo feature was the second time in a year DeepMind had made the cover of Nature. Ten months later, last October, the team made a third appearance in the journal, making them singularly prolific among their academic peers. With its cadre of researchers, from Bayesian mathematicians to cognitive neuroscientists, statisticians and computer scientists, DeepMind has amassed arguably the most formidable community of world-leading academics specialising in machine intelligence anywhere in the world. “What we are trying to do is a unique cultural hybrid — the focus and energy you get from start-ups with the kind of blue-sky thinking you get from academia,” says Demis Hassabis, co-founder and chief executive. “We’ve hired 250 of the world’s best scientists, so obviously they’re here to let their creativity run riot, and we try and create an environment that’s perfect for that.” We learn about our algorithms by testing them on real-world, messy data sets Mustafa Suleyman DeepMind’s researchers have in common a clearly defined if lofty mission: to crack human intelligence and recreate it artificially. The undertaking is one that 40-year-old Hassabis has been pondering ever since he became a professional chess master at 13 and the world number two in his age group. “Playing chess at that young age got me thinking, how does the brain come up with moves and how do you make plans?” he says. “I got my first computer when I was eight. I bought it with winnings from chess competitions. One of the first big programs I wrote when I was 11 was an AI to play Othello. It wasn’t particularly good, but it could give someone a game.” Today, the goal is not just to create a powerful AI to play games better than a human professional, but to use that knowledge “for large-scale social impact”, says DeepMind’s other co-founder, Mustafa Suleyman, a former conflict-resolution negotiator at the UN. DeepMind chief executive Demis Hassabis © Charlie Bibby The line might sound insincere if it came from an executive in Silicon Valley, where practically every start-up believes it is about to change the world. DeepMind, however, might actually be understating the sea-changes it is driving: its scientific advances are already employed in complex real-world scenarios that require pattern recognition, long-term planning and decision-making. AlphaGo-like algorithms are, for example, being used to study protein-folding to speed up new drug discoveries at the UK’s Crick Institute; to analyse medical images to allow sharper cancer diagnoses and treatment plans at London’s University College Hospital; and to save enormous amounts of energy in power-hungry data centres at Google. In the last of these, DeepMind’s experiment resulted in energy savings of 15 per cent — or 40 per cent of cooling energy — translating to millions of dollars. The company now hopes to expand its range of clients to the UK’s National Grid and other utilities providers. “We learn so much about the strength and weaknesses of our algorithms by testing them on large-scale, real-world, noisy and messy data sets,” says Suleyman. “It’s a pretty unique way to make progress with our toughest social problems.” To solve seemingly intractable problems in healthcare, scientific research or energy, it is not enough just to assemble scores of scientists in a building; they have to be untethered from the mundanities of a regular job — funding, administration, short-term deadlines — and left to experiment freely and without fear. “If you look at how Google worked five or six years ago, [its research] was very product-related and relatively short-term, and it was considered to be a strength,” Hassabis says. “[But] if you’re interested in advancing the research as fast as possible, then you need to give [scientists] the space to make the decisions based on what they think is right for research, not for whatever kind of product demand has just come in.” DeepMind’s three appearances in quick succession in Nature, along with more than 120 papers published and presented at cutting-edge scientific conferences, are a mark of its prodigious scientific productivity. It is also an indication of its special status at Google. “Our research team today is insulated from any short-term pushes or pulls, whether it be internally at Google or externally. We want to have a big impact on the world, but our research has to be protected,” Hassabis says. “We showed that you can make a lot of advances using this kind of culture. I think Google took notice of that and they’re shifting more towards this kind of longer-term research.” DeepMind has six more early manuscripts that it hopes will be published by Nature, or by that other most highly regarded scientific journal, Science, within the next year. “We may publish better than most academic labs, but our aim is not to produce a Nature paper,” Hassabis says. “We concentrate on cracking very specific problems. What I tell people here is that it should be a natural side-effect of doing great science.” Structurally, DeepMind’s researchers are organised into four main groups with titles such as “Neuroscience” or “Frontiers” (a group comprising mostly physicists and mathematicians who test the most futuristic theories in AI). Beyond these are several smaller teams with deeper specialities. Many of the project managers are former video game producers who joined from Hassabis’s previous company, Elixir Studios, an independent games developer. Every eight weeks, scientists present what they have achieved to team leaders, including Hassabis and Shane Legg, head of research, who decide how to allocate resources to the dozens of projects. “It’s sort of a bubbling cauldron of ideas, and exploration, and testing things out, and finding out what seems to be working and why — or why not,” Legg says. Projects that are progressing rapidly are allocated more manpower and time, while others may be closed down, all in a matter of weeks. “In academia you’d have to wait for a couple of years for a new grant cycle, but we can be very quick about switching resources,” Hassabis says. We want to have a big impact on the world, but our research has to be protected Demis Hassabis At any point in time, the company also has two or three special forces-style units called “strike teams” that are formed temporarily to achieve a particular goal. “This is what we did with AlphaGo. Once it started showing promise in the first six months, we put a large team of 15 people with specialised skills on it, to push that to the end,” Hassabis says. “It allows us to pick exactly the right specialists to make the perfect complementary team without being beholden to traditional reporting lines. So, they’re like on secondment to that project, and then they go back to their original teams.” This organisational culture has been a magnet for some of the world’s brightest minds. Jane Wang, a cognitive neuroscientist at DeepMind, used to be a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University in Chicago, and says that she was attracted to DeepMind’s clear, social mission. “I have interviewed at other industry labs, but DeepMind is different in that there isn’t pressure to patent or come up with products — there is no issue with the bottom line. The mission here is about being curious,” she says. For Matt Botvinick, neuroscience team lead, joining DeepMind was not just a career choice but a lifestyle change too. The former professor who led Princeton University’s Neuroscience Institute continues to live in the US, where his wife is a practising physician, and commutes to DeepMind’s labs in London every other week. “At Princeton, I was surrounded by people I considered utterly brilliant and had no interest in working in an environment any less focused on primary scientific questions,” he says. “But I couldn’t resist the opportunity to come here because there is something qualitatively new going on, both with the scale and the spirit of ideas.” What sets DeepMind apart from academic labs, he says, is its culture of cross-disciplinary collaboration, reflected in the company’s hiring of experts, who can cut across different domains from psychology to deep learning, physics or computer programming. “In a lot of research institutions, things can become siloed. Two neighbouring labs could be working on similar topics but never exchange and pool information,” Botvinick says. “Unlike any place I’ve ever experienced before, all conversations are enhanced rather than undermined by differences in background.” Illustration by Scott Chambers Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

(Peter Nowak) Don’t look now, but Montreal is quickly becoming a cloud computing hotspot. Google has pegged the city to host a new data centre, making it the company’s first “Cloud Region” in Canada. The move follows a similar announcement by Amazon, which recently opened a cluster of data centres around Montreal. IBM and French cloud computing company OVH have also set up centres in Quebec, as have several Canadian companies including Bell and Cogeco. Tech Startups to Watch: Montreal Amazon cited Quebec’s lower electricity prices, compared to Ontario, as a major reason for its decision to location in the province. Google says its decision stems from Montreal’s large and growing pool of science and engineering talent. “There’s a groundswell in artificial intelligence and machine learning happening,”  says James Lambe, country manager for Google Cloud in Canada. The company did not specify how much it is investing or when the Cloud Region will be up and running, citing contract terms. Google has nearly 100 employees in Montreal already, as well as offices in Toronto and Ottawa and an engineering hub in Kitchener, Ont. The company has six other Cloud Regions currently operating around the world – Oregon, Iowa, South Carolina, Belgium, Taiwan and Tokyo – and plans to open at least another eight this year in addition to Montreal. Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard says the new data centre will help businesses in the province become more globally competitive. “With an ever-changing business environment, our economic plan aims to help our businesses adapt to the new technological reality and foster the competitiveness of Quebec to attract investment for leading players,” he said in a statement. “We are happy to welcome the addition of the Google Cloud Region in Montreal with which Quebec-based business and Canada will take another step into a 21st century economy.” Lambe says the new Montreal Cloud Region, which will provide traditional data centre information hosting and also offer Google’s various services and customer support, will deliver both technical and regulatory benefits to Canadian businesses. Customers who store their data in Google’s cloud will get faster access to it simply by virtue of being closer to it. Perhaps more importantly, a growing list of countries – including Canada – are considering enacting regulations that would prevent businesses and organizations from storing their data abroad for security and privacy reasons. Why Paytm, India's biggest fintech startup, opened its innovation lab in Canada By locating within Canada, Google says it can obviate such potential data sovereignty issues, especially for companies or organizations that are already prevented from hosting abroad because they deal with sensitive information. “It allows organizations that have traditionally not been able to play in this particular space to take advantage of the real value and innovation this can bring,” Lambe says. Some Canadian customers are fans of the move. Oakville, Ont.-based Geotab, which makes vehicle fleet-tracking systems, says that being able to house data in Cloud Regions outside the United States will help it expand to other countries, particularly in Europe. “Having options about where the data is resident is great for us,” says chief executive Neil Cawse. “It’s so simple for us to deploy the data in these other countries.” Google is facing an uphill battle in cloud services. The company only properly reorganized its various offerings, which include mapping, document collaboration, machine learning and artificial intelligence, into a proper cloud business last year after hiring VMWare co-founder Diane Greene in 2015. Amazon has so far been running away with the business, accounting for about 40 per cent of the market, according to Synergy Research Group. The next three competitors – Microsoft, IBM and Google – only account for a combined market share of about 25 per cent or so. Google Canada plans for growth with a new Kitchener HQ The search giant is pushing hard, however, and announced a number of high-profile customer wins at its Next developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday. Companies that have converted their IT systems to Google Cloud or are in the process of doing so include Disney, Colgate Palmolive, eBay and HSBC. U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon has also switched to Google’s productivity apps, a big defection from Microsoft’s Azure cloud services, according to Bloomberg. Geotab’s Cawse says his company is a similar defector, with Google’s services being considerably cheaper and easier to use than rivals’ offerings. “They feel a little hungrier to me and they’re innovating pretty fast,” he says. “We’ve never looked back.” Google chairman Eric Schmidt told conference attendees that he expects the company to be aggressive in trying to win new customers. “We’re here for real,” he said. “And now we have the references.” Why a new wave of tech startups might actually, finally, disrupt real estate MORE ABOUT BIG DATA: Why Paytm, India’s biggest fintech startup, opened its innovation lab in Canada Meet the economists trying to publish economic data faster than StatsCan Why a new wave of tech startups might actually, finally, disrupt real estate Hillary Clinton’s loss is a warning to marketers: big data won’t save you How big data and digital apps are going to transform farming The New Connected World Change Agents 2016: Shelby Walsh, Trend Hunter How MBA schools are pushing students to build up their data literacy skills Like Us Follow @cdnbiz Subscribe with Texture Get our daily briefing on innovation, leadership, technology & the economy.

Google serves ads to users of its Gmail service based on the contents of their e-mails, which has prompted questions from privacy and rights activists for years. However, while Gmail users may agree to agree to such usage of their data by Google, those who don't use Gmail clearly have not. That is the at the core of the class action lawsuit against Google that it is seeking to settle. Plaintiffs argue that Google's scanning of e-mails sent by non-Gmail users to Gmail users violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act and California Invasion of Privacy Act. Google presented a proposed settlement but it has been rejected by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California. It provided for up to $2.2 million in fees and expenses for the plaintiffs lawyers, but none for the plaintiffs. Judge Koh questioned whether the settlement would ensure Google's compliance with the law in the future. Koh also found proposed disclosure notices to be inadequate, comparing to a similar accord with Yahoo that requires more disclosures. "In sum, based on the parties' current filings, the court cannot conclude that the settlement is fundamentally fair, adequate, and reasonable," Koh wrote, reports Reuters.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Classroom can now be accessed through personal Google accounts By Ida Torres - March 16, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google Classroom has helped schools, teachers, and students learn beyond the four walls of an actual classroom. But previously, you needed to have a G Suite for Education account in order to be a part of this. Now the tech giant has decided to bring “technology to people who want to lear, no matter what the setting.” So their latest announcement is that you can join any of the virtual classrooms just by using your personal Google account. Previously, requiring people to have a G Suite for Education account for this educational collaboration tool was pretty limiting for both teachers and schools. For example, if you had guest lecturers or student teachers who needed to be part of the virtual classroom, they couldn’t just use this service. But now, as long as you have a functioning Google account, then administrators will be able to add you to specific classes that you are authorized to join. The G Suite for Education administrators will have updated settings so they have better control over who can join their classes, whether it’s with the said personal account or from other G Suite domains. This will open up collaboration with other schools and organizations as well. For now, using your personal account here will allow you to join existing classes. But later on, probably in upcoming updates, you will even be allowed to create your own classes. Google is still encouraging schools to sign up for G Suite for Education as there are still plenty of things that teachers and students can do there. They are also looking for stories on how Google Classrooms has helped foster both teaching and learning through technology.

That means many more of us will be able to take advantage of Google's latest and smartest AI. There are some things both the Google Assistant and Siri are excellent at — like pulling up emails or showing photos you've taken in the last week in a specific city (Apple really seems to be catching up to Google in the image analysis department). Image: David Nield/Gizmodo But there are some things Google just does better. So stop with the Apple envy and read about some of the key areas where Google Assistant has the edge over Apple's own digital AI. 1) Getting instant answers from the web Image: Screenshots Some of Google's instant answers might be on the dubious side but Google Assistant seems better at pulling nuggets of information from the web. It correctly responded to "who won the Best Director Oscar?" and "who wrote The Body In The Library?" with Damien Chazelle and Agatha Christie respectively. Siri, in contrast, gave us a list of movies (not including La La Land) for the answer to the first question, and listed the results of a Bing search for the second (which, to be fair, included Agatha Christie in the snippet previews). Obviously Siri gets a lot of questions right too, but Google Assistant seems to be ahead here. 2) Finding places nearby Image: Screenshots Both Siri and Google Assistant do a decent enough job of finding restaurants, bars, and other kind of businesses nearby, but Google's app came out on top in our tests, not just on the places it returned, but on the interface: results are presented in a simple carousel and you can quickly jump to a Google Maps view. Over on Siri the results list is more difficult to parse and appears to cast a wider net. Your mileage may vary depending on your location and the data these apps have to work with, but where we're from Google Assistant is currently more useful. 3) Remembering what you've already said Images: Screenshots Out of the gate Google Assistant promised smart, contextual responses, so if you asked follow-up questions it would respond sensibly. However it wasn't always as smart as we would have liked, and Siri is now just as good at dealing with those follow-up questions, so you can ask both apps for the weather in Sydney, then say "and New York?" and get the right answer. Where Google Assistant still has the edge is remembering stuff about you (predictably enough for a Google service). Tell the Google Assistant your favourite soccer team, and it remembers that information; Siri just lists soccer fixtures. It's not a huge feature, but now you don't have to out yourself as a Manchester United fan at the bar, and instead can just ask "how did my favourite team do?" 4) Speaking in foreign languages Images: Screenshots Google Assistant is just more loquacious than Siri full stop, but one area where this really comes in handy is with getting short phrases translated. Ask Google Assistant to say "how are you?" or "what's the time?" in Spanish and you get the answers read back to you with authentic accents. Siri simply searches Wolfram Alpha for a translation, so it doesn't really work for phrases and you don't get the added bonus of hearing the pronunciation. If you're a long way from home and need to find a bathroom, then Google Assistant is far more helpful (provided you have a decent data plan). 5) Going beyond being an assistant Images: Screenshots Google Assistant is much more than an assistant, despite the name: it will read you poetry, tell you a joke, or play a game with you. At the moment Siri can't do any of those things, and returns a rather evasive response (though to give it credit, it will direct you to the App Store if you ask to play a game). It's perhaps a sign of Google's ambition for its new Assistant app, as a whole new interface for the web and your phone rather than just an add-on. It's also fair to say it's still more rough around the edges than Siri is, but Apple's got its work cut out if it wants to keep pace with what Google's doing. Comments Ender Guest Mar 17, 2017, 10:37am Honestly, I like the Siri poetry response better... It's a nice tribute to Douglas Adams (as the third worst poetry in the universe is, of course, Vogon poetry :) Reply 0 Rodk Guest Mar 17, 2017, 10:40am 5) "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that..." Reply 0 grim @grim Mar 17, 2017, 10:46am Been long pressing my home button everyday on my Nexus 6P hoping to have assistant, still no dice. Is Australia part of the roll out? Reply 0 namarrgon @namarrgon Mar 17, 2017, 11:48am Yeah I have it on my Nexus 6P; you have to change the system language to English (US) then restart. It'll roll out to the UK & AU "soon", but if you can't wait, you'll have to put up with a US accent. Reply 1 colski @colski Mar 17, 2017, 11:18am Got the update on my Samsung s6 but had to change my language to English(US) and it install when I restarted my phone. Reply 0 Akex Guest Mar 18, 2017, 1:43am And it will disappear on you soon and you won't be able to get it back. This rollout is absolute shit. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

The company announced the new product on Wednesday May 18, 2016 at its annual I/O developer conference. By Jackie Wattles NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Google Home wasn't advertising the release of the new movie "Beauty and the Beast," but that's what many users thought. When some Google Home owners turned on their virtual assistants Thursday morning, the device delivered the usual weather forecast, calendar of events and other updates. And then they heard something else: "By the way, Disney's live action 'Beauty and the Beast' opens today." People soon took to social media sites to complain about what they thought was an advertisement. "Google is slipping adverts into users' daily summaries on Google Home. Just a phenomenally dumb and irritating move," one Twitter user wrote. Google, however, said in a statement that it wasn't an ad at all. By Thursday evening, it had removed the message from Google Home's lexicon. "This wasn't intended to be an ad. What's circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content," the statement said. "We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case." The Google team determines which extras are mentioned in the My Day feature, and the company occasionally works with partners -- such as StoryCorps or the Oscars -- on the content. However, a spokesperson did not specify whether Disney was included in its decision to call attention to the "Beauty and the Beast" premiere. Disney could not be immediately reached for comment.

Tech Apple Science Cars Geneva Motor Show Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Get Extremely Close To An Active Volcano With Google Street View Posted: Mar 16 2017, 3:27pm CDT | by Hira Bashir, Updated: Mar 16 2017, 3:41pm CDT, in News | Latest Science News   Credit: Google Street View   Google Street View technology shows the inside of an fiery active volcano located in Vanuatu Google Street View takes its users to a virtual journey inside a fiery active volcano in Vanuatu and makes you feel as you are actually walking on the rim of an active volcano. Don't Miss: Win a Free Nintendo NES Classic in our Giveaway The incredible 360 imagery of the Ambrym volcano was made possible by the efforts of two explorers Geoff Mackley and Chris Horsley. The pair travelled to the fairly isolated and unfamiliar country of Vanuatu, which is located more than 1,000 miles east of Australia. But the most challenging part of their journey was when they climbed 400 meters into the Marum crater with a Street View camera. They could see a boiling lava lake right in front of them. “Standing at the edge and feeling the heat lick your skin is phenomenal,” said Chris Horsley after returning from the volcano. “I hope that by putting this place on the map people will realize what a beautiful world we live in.” Launched in 2007, Google Street View has already provided panoramic views from many landmarks, natural wonders as well as museums and other buildings. But it is the first time Google have expanded its technology to an extreme location like active volcano Ambrym. Ambrym is one of the nine active volcanoes in the archipelago of Vanautu. The volcano has erupted several times in the past 100 years and it is still a danger because it can erupt at anytime. The 360 imagery of Ambrym volcano and Marum crater is now available on Google Street View and people can get up and close with this extreme location while staying at safe and comfortable environments of their homes.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) NEW YORK (AP) - Google is trying to improve the quality of its search results by directing review teams to flag content that might come across as upsetting or offensive. With the change, content with racial slurs could now get flagged under a new category called “upsetting-offensive.” So could content that promotes hate or violence against a specific group of people based on gender, race or other criteria. While flagging something doesn’t directly affect the search results themselves, it’s used to tweak the company’s software so that better content ranks higher. This approach might, for instance, push down content that is inaccurate or has other questionable attributes, thereby giving prominence to trustworthy sources. The review teams — comprised of contractors known as “quality raters” — already comb through websites and other content to flag questionable items. Google added “upsetting-offensive” in its latest guidelines for quality raters. Google declined to comment on the changes, which were reported in some blogs. The guidelines, which run 160 pages, are an interesting look into how Google ranks the quality of its search results. For instance, it gives examples of “high-quality” pages, such as the home page of a newspaper that has “won seven Pulitzer Prize awards,” and “low-quality” pages, such as an article that includes “many grammar and punctuation errors.” The guidelines cite an example of “Holocaust history” as a search query. A resulting website listing “Top 10 reasons why the holocaust didn’t happen” would get flagged. The new “upsetting-offensive” flag instructs quality raters to “flag to all web results that contain upsetting or offensive content from the perspective of users in your locale, even if the result satisfies the user intent.” So even if the results are what the person searched for, such as white supremacist websites, they could still get flagged. But it doesn’t mean the results won’t show up at all when someone searches for them.

Google’s fight with Uber over self-driving cars is heating up Posted Mar 16, 2017 by Kate Conger (@kateconger) 0 SHARES Next Story Utilis takes top water innovation prize at Imagine H2O for tech that finds leaks underground Google’s legal battle with Uber over the development of self-driving cars is already off to an ugly start. Lawyers for the two tech firms spent the last two days bickering over which attorneys should be allowed to view the trade secrets Google claims were stolen by their former employees who went to work at Uber, and a lawyer for Uber said today in court that the company has been unable to locate one of those engineers. Google’s self-driving car unit is taking Uber to court over allegations that a star figure in the development of automated vehicles, Anthony Levandowski, stole trade secrets from Google before he abruptly quit his job. Soon thereafter, he founded his own self-driving truck company, Otto, which was acquired by Uber for $680 million. Waymo, the self-driving wing of Google’s parent company Alphabet, claims that Levandowski downloaded 14,000 sensitive documents from a secure repository just before quitting without notice in January 2016. The company has also accused two other engineers, Radu Raduta and Sameet Kshirsagar, of swiping a handful of documents before they also accepted jobs at Uber. Raduta doesn’t work for Uber anymore, Uber’s attorney Arturo Gonzalez told the court, and Uber hasn’t been able to locate him. Waymo claims that Raduta, who worked as a mechanical engineer for the company, downloaded several documents related to the self-driving car project last July, just before going to work at Uber. Related Articles Waymo files for an injunction against Uber's use of its self-driving tech Here's what the head of Uber's self-driving program wasn't asked on stage today Waymo sues Uber and Otto for theft of trade secrets Gonzalez told reporters that Uber plans to argue in upcoming filings that the “whole matter” belongs in arbitration between Google and Levandowski, citing Levandowski’s contract with his former employer. Uber also pushed back against Waymo’s claims that none of Uber’s in-house lawyers should be allowed to see unredacted versions of court filings that contain Google trade secrets. The two companies eventually settled on an agreement that just one of Uber’s in-house lawyers, Nicole Bartow, would be allowed to view the documents. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Uber Founded 2009 Overview Uber, a [San Francisco](/location/san-francisco/528f5e3c90d111115d1c2e4ff979d58e)-based technology startup, is innovating at the intersection of lifestyle and logistics.

According to the search giant, these new apps will focus more on the enterprise users with its previous Hangout service. Hangouts Meet is a video-conferencing platform developed to make online meetings easy. It does not require any plugins or native applications, just a link is enough, to begin with, the meeting. This meeting can have up to 30 participants if you are a G Suite Enterprise user and it supports up to 25 people if you are a G Suite Basic and Business users. Also Read: Finally, Google Store lets you buy products from any other country Google says,"We've consistently heard from customers about ways we can improve Hangouts, like making it easier to work with external clients or reducing the 'time to start' a meeting to zero. That's why we've built Hangouts Meet to have a light, fast interface and smart participant management." in their official blog post. Hangout Chat is a text-based messaging service similar to Slack or Microsoft Teams. Like Slack, Hangout Chat will also support integrations with other services and bots. Google's first Hangouts bot @meet is used in this Chat app. It uses natural language processing and machine learning to automatically schedule meetings with Hangouts Meet and Google Calendar. This new chat app also facilitates multiple virtual rooms for different projects, threaded conversations, and a filterable search to find all your content from the initial stage of your project. Its integration with G Suite allows the user to share content from Drive and Docs, and also to view the photos and videos directly in conversations. The Hangouts Meet app is already available to download on App Store and Google Play Store wherein the Hangouts Chat can only be accessed by G Suite customers through Early Adopter Program. Hangouts Meet is also available as a web client for its G Suite customers.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Mar 16, 2017 at 7:32PM Analysts haven't been kind to Snap (NYSE:SNAP) since it made its IPO. Not one analyst has given Snap stock a buy rating, and shares have fallen considerably from its opening price at the beginning of the month. Most recently, market researcher eMarketer lowered its expectations for Snap's U.S. ad revenue from $800 million to $770 million. The reason behind the lower estimate is "higher-than-estimated revenue sharing with partners." Snapchat offers revenue sharing as an incentive for content publishers to use its Publisher Stories (formerly Discover) format. Snap is also partnering with various media companies to produce original shows, which may provide even more favorable revenue share for the content producer. Let's take a look at how revenue sharing affects Snap's financials. Image source: Snap/Author. Revenue sharing doesn't impact Snap's top line While eMarketer is lowering its expectations for Snapchat, the actual decline in net ad revenue won't show up in Snap's top line. Snap reports gross revenue similarly to how Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reports Google's revenue. Google lumps in revenue from its network partners with its search and YouTube revenue, and then accounts for revenue sharing as part of its traffic acquisition costs. The amount of revenue Snap shares with its publisher partners is then reported as an item in the company's cost of revenue. So, eMarketer may have well said it expects Snap's cost of revenue to come in $30 million higher than originally anticipated. Snap's Publisher Stories. Image source: Snap. Last year, Snap says revenue sharing payments increased $48.2 million from 2015, but it doesn't provide a specific amount it paid to partners. That does at least provide a floor, and it's nearly 12% of Snap's $404.5 million in total revenue last year. For comparison, Google paid out $10.9 billion in revenue sharing to its network partners (not including YouTube) in 2016. That's almost 14% of its total ad revenue for the year. Revenue sharing may increase even faster While most analysts expect Snap to grow its top line to around $1 billion this year, its path to that mark may mean less of that revenue makes it past the second line (cost of revenue) on its income statement. Snap has inked several high-profile deals with media companies over the last year. It already has deals in place with NBC, ABC, BBC, Turner, New York Time, Discovery, Time, A+E Networks, and VICE to produce original shows for Snapchat. Snap is still actively pursuing these high-profile deals. It's important to note that Snap says its revenue-sharing arrangements "generally do not contain minimum financial commitments to our publisher partners and are generally not tied to specific events or promotions." That seems to indicate Snap doesn't pay anything up front for these productions, but Snap may help out with the costs as "content creation costs" also show up in management's description of cost of revenue. Content creation costs include personnel-related costs, according to Snap's S-1. With the growth of the Publisher Stories platform, investors should expect a stark increase in cost of goods sold due to revenue-sharing and content-creation costs. Cost of revenue is already under scrutiny Snap posted a negative gross margin last year as its cost of revenue overshadowed its revenue. The biggest factor behind it is Snap's hosting expenses, for which it primarily relies on Google Cloud. It's already committed to spending $3 billion in total on cloud infrastructure over the next five years, which will continue to put pressure on Snap's gross margin as it tries to scale. Add to that the fact that one of its revenue drivers is growing content from publisher partners, which contributes to even more cost of revenue. While a few tens of millions of dollars is relatively small compared to the hundreds of millions Snap is spending with its cloud partners each year, Snap's margins are so thin that every dollar counts.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) faq, Google Google Data Center FAQ by Data Center Knowledge  on March 16, 2017 1 comment Tweet Google is the largest, most-used search engine in the world, with a global market share that has held steady at about 90 percent since Google Search launched in 1997 as Backrub. In 2017, Google became the most valuable brand in the world, topping Apple, according to the Brand Finance Global 500 report. Google’s position is due mainly to its core business as a search engine and its ability to transform users into payers via advertising. About 32 percent of Google visitors come from the US, where the company holds 63.9 percent of the search engine market, according to statista.com. Google had 247 million unique US users in November 2015. Globally, it boasts 1.5 billion search engine users and more than 1 billion users of Gmail. Google data centers process an average of 40 million searches per second, resulting in 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year, Internet Live Stats reports. That’s up from 795.2 million searcher per year in 1999, one year after Google was launched.

In a reorganization in October 2015, Google became a subsidiary of a new company it created called Alphabet. Since then, several projects have been canceled or scaled back, including the halt of further rollout of Google Fiber. Following the reorg, however, Google has placed a lot of focus (and dedicated a lot of resources) to selling cloud services to enterprises, going head-to-head against the market giant Amazon Web Services and the second-largest player in the space, Microsoft Azure. That has meant a major expansion of Google data centers specifically to support those cloud services. At the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco in March 2017, the company’s execs revealed that it spent nearly $30 billion on data centers over the preceding three years. While the company already has what is probably the world’s largest cloud, it was not built to support enterprise cloud services. To do that, the company needs to have data centers in more locations, and that’s what it has been doing, adding new locations to support cloud services and adding cloud data center capacity wherever it makes sense in existing locations. The largest of several murals illustrator Fuchsia MacAree painted on the walls of Google’s data center in Dublin (Photo: Google) Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about Google data centers and our best stab at answering them: Where are Google Data Centers Located? Google lists eight data center locations in the U.S., one in South America, four in Europe and two in Asia. Its cloud sites, however, are expanding, and Google’s cloud map shows many points of presence worldwide. The company also has many caching sites in colocation facilities throughout the world, whose locations it does not share. This far-flung network is necessary not only to support operations than run 24/7, but to meet specific regulations (like the EU’s privacy regulations) of certain regions and to ensure business continuity in the face of risks like natural disasters. Google data centers in the Dalles, Oregon, 2006 (Photo by Craig Mitchelldyer/Getty Images) In the works as of March 2017, are Google data centers for cloud services in California, Canada, The Netherlands, Northern Virginia, São Paulo, London, Finland, Frankfurt, Mumbai, Singapore, and Sydney. Here are the data center sites listed by Google: North America: Berkeley County, South Carolina Council Bluffs, Iowa Douglas County, Georgia Jackson County, Alabama Lenoir, North Carolina Mayes County, Oklahoma Montgomery County, Tennessee The Dalles, Oregon South America Quilicura, Chile Asia Changhua County, Taiwan Singapore Europe Dublin, Ireland Eemshaven, Netherlands Hamina, Finland St Ghislain, Belgium How Big are Google Data Centers? A paper presented during the IEEE 802.3bs Task Force in May 2014 estimates the size of five of Google’s US facilities as: Pryor Creek (Mayes County), Oklahoma , 980,000 square feet Lenoir, North Carolina, 337,000 square feet The Dalles, Oregon, 200,000 square feet (before the 2016, 164,000 square foot expansion) Council Bluff, Iowa, 200,000 square feet Berkely County, South Carolina, 200,000 square feet. Many of these sites have multiple data center buildings, as Google prefers to build additional structures as sites expand rather than containing operations in a single massive building. Google itself doesn’t disclose the size of its data centers. Instead, it mentions the cost of the sites or number of employees. Sometimes, facility size slips out. For example, the announcement about the opening of The Dalles in Oregon said the initial building was 164,000 square feet. The size of subsequent expansions, however, has been kept tightly under wraps. Reports discussing Google’s new data center in Emeshaven, Netherlands, which opened December 2016, didn’t mention size. Instead, they said the company has contracted for the entire 62 Megawatt output of a nearby windfarm and ran 9,941 miles of computer cable within the facility. The data center employs 150 people. How Many Servers Does Google Have? There’s no official data on how many servers there are in Google data centers, but Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers. This number, of course, is always changing as the company expands capacity and refreshes its hardware.   1 | 2 | 3 Previous Article Google Opens a New Front in Cloud Price Wars Next Article Everything You Wanted to Know about Google Data Centers Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

By Paul Krill Editor at Large, InfoWorld | Mar 16, 2017 3:00 AM PT Credit: C_osett More like this Android Studio for beginners, Part 4: Advanced tools and plugins InfoWorld's 2017 Technology of the Year Award winners Android's Jack and Jill compilers head uphill to developers Android's mobile application build system will natively support Java 8 features going forward, with Google deprecating the Jack toolchain. Jack has served as a toolchain to compile Java source code into Android dex byte code, with Java providing the basis of Android development. But now, Google wants to support Java 8 features directly in the current javax and dx set of tools. Existing tools and plugins dependent on the Java class file format still should work, said Google Product Manager James Lau. Google plans to launch the native support as part of its Android Studio IDE in coming weeks. Google had tested Java 8 support through Jack. "Over time, we realized the cost of switching to Jack was too high for our community when we considered the annotation processors, byte code analyzers, and rewriters impacted," said Lau. Developers can keep using Jack to build Java 8 code until the new support is available, and Lau predicted that the migration would mean little to no work. Java 8, which fitted the language with lambda capabilities, debuted in March 2014. Android has supported lambdas and other Java 8 capabilities, including type annotations, method references, and default and static interface methods. The mobile platform also has supported Java 7 language features. Next up is Java 9, due in late July and featuring modularity and a host of other features. In his bulletin, Lau made no mention of the upcoming Java upgrade. The Android build system compiles application resources and source code for packaging into Android Application Packages for testing and distribution. Android Studio uses the Gradle build toolkit to automate the build process. This story, "Android switches to native Java 8 support" was originally published by InfoWorld.

(AAP) Previous Next Show Grid Previous Next Hide Grid Image 1/ Video Audio Google could soon flag content with racial slurs under a new category called 'upsetting-offensive'. Source: AAP 17 Mar 2017 - 10:44 AM  UPDATED 17 Mar 2017 - 10:44 AM Tweet Google is trying to improve the quality of its search results by directing review teams to flag content that might come across as upsetting or offensive. With the change, content with racial slurs could get flagged under a new category called "upsetting-offensive". So could content that promotes hate or violence against a specific group of people based on gender, race or other criteria. While flagging something does not directly affect the search results themselves, it is used to tweak the company's software so better content ranks higher. This approach might, for instance, push down content that is inaccurate or has other questionable attributes, thereby giving prominence to trustworthy sources. The review teams - comprised of contractors known as "quality raters" - already comb through websites and other content to flag questionable items such as pornography. Google added "upsetting-offensive" in its latest guidelines for quality raters. Google declined to comment on the changes, which were reported in the blog Search Engine Land and elsewhere. The guidelines run 160 pages and reveal how Google ranks the quality of its search results. For instance, it gives examples of "high-quality" pages, such as the home page of a newspaper that has "won seven Pulitzer Prize awards," and "low-quality" pages, such as an article that includes "many grammar and punctuation errors". The new "upsetting-offensive" flag instructs quality raters to "flag to all web results that contain upsetting or offensive content from the perspective of users in your locale, even if the result satisfies the user intent". So even if the results are what the person searched for, such as white supremacist websites, they could still get flagged. But it does not mean the results will not show up at all when someone searches for them.

Many Reddit and Twitter users have reported hearing an 'advertisement' for the opening day of the film after using the configuration 'My Day' when speaking to the virtual assistant. Following information about the weather, commute and daily reminders, the AI seamless said 'By the way, Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast opens today'.  Scroll down for videos  WHAT CAN YOU HEAR WITH MY DAY?  Weather: Hear the day’s forecast. Commute: Hear an overview of traffic to work and an estimated travel time. Reminders: Hear a list of reminders that you have set for the day. Calendar: Hear details about your next meeting.  This calendar is linked to the Google Account that was used to set up Google Home. Flight status: Hear the status of your upcoming flights. Note: You can't turn off flight status There have been numerous cases shared on Reddit, with some users suggesting it could be a result of showing interest in movies that are similar or if the user previously searched for that one specifically – but those who have heard that ad said neither are the case. And some Twitter users recorded the incident as it unfolded.  'It wasn't intended to be an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales,' a Google spokesperson told DailyMail.com in an email. 'What's circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content.' 'We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case.' 'My Day' configurations are weather, commute, calendar, reminders, and news, and I definitely haven't searched for the film either,' one Redditor wrote.

'By the way, Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast opens today', Google Home said. 'In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer if you ask me.' After listing My Day information, the users stated that the Assistant went straight into a promo for Beauty and the Beast (pictured). 'By the way, Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast opens today', Google Home said GOOGLE'S VIRTUAL ASSISTANT   At the unveiling of Home in May, Google boss Sundar Pichai said: 'We think of the assistant as an ambient experience that goes across devices - this is more than just phones, it will be on devices they wear, in their car and in their living rooms.' The leading tech companies are all competing to assist consumers in their online activities such as shopping, since that gives the companies a better chance of selling advertising or other services. Home-based systems like the Echo are taking on more importance with the advent of improved voice technology, according to Julie Ask, an analyst at Forrester Research. The smart speaker, which costs $130, can do everything from play music to control your lights - and has the vast knowledge of Google's search engine as its 'brain'. Ask about your day, and the Home speaker will give you the time, weather, estimated commute, the news and upcoming calendar appointments. The speaker is a really lovely piece of design, and it's tough to fault the hardware. If you're not keen on the colour, you can simply swap the bottom part for another color or material.  'For some more movie fun, ask me something about Belle.'  Google's Assistant in the messaging app Allo was also found to share some unwanted information this week – other people's search content in the middle of text conversations with other users.  You may want to think twice about your next search query, as Google's mobile messaging app might not keep it a secret. Google noted that what users heard 'wasn't intended to be an ad' 'What's circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content,' a Google spokesperson told DailyMail.com in an email Allo, which includes Assistant, has been found to share people's search content in the middle of text conversations with other users. The flaw was discovered by Recode after a friend asked the bot a question, which answered using details from a previous search - but Google has since fixed the issue.  'We were notified about the Assistant in group chats not working as intended,' a Google spokesperson told DailyMail.com in an email. 'We've fixed the issue and appreciate the report.'  Google announced earlier this month that it was rolling its Assistant out to more Android smartphones and releasing other features as well.  Google's Assistant in the messaging app Allo was also found to share some unwanted information this week – other people's search content in the middle of text conversations with other users. A flaw discovered by Recode (pictured) And now Android users can access Assistant via Allo.  For example, if you're making plans to see a movie, you can ask the AI what times it is playing and both you and your friend will see the results. However, Tess Townsend with Recode has recently found that the AI isn't always perfect. 'In the middle of our conversation, my friend directed Assistant to identify itself,' Townsend wrote. 'Instead of offering a name or a pithy retort, it responded with a link from Harry Potter fan website Pottermore.' HOW DOES ALLO WORK?  Allo accesses Google's smart assistant, which uses the firms neural networks and search engine. It allows users to chat with friends and workers, and has a new feature called 'shout' allowing users to change the size messages appear depending on how important they are.  It also predicts responses to posts, and even pictures by analysing what's in them, and has Google's assistant built in. This allows the app to use Googe's search capabilities to access the assistant when booking restaurants, using OpenTable to make bookings, for instance.   'The link led to an extract from 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,' the fifth book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.' 'But the response was not merely a non sequitur. It was a result related to previous searches my friend said he had done a few days earlier.' She also noted that Harry Potter was not included in any of her previous searches, nor was there any mention of it during the conversation.  Although the glitch does raise a few flags regarding privacy issues, Assistant is designed to safeguard some information. If you ask for your own information while chatting with another users, the AI will first require permission. But Townsend had asked 'what is my job' in another conversation and Assistant pulled up Google Maps and pinpointed her location for the other users to see. A reporter with Recode said when their friend asked Assistant a question it answered with a link from one of their previous search queries - without being asked or instructed to do so Allo has been criticized in the past for its privacy issues, but this time was by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Snowden claimed that the 'smart' messaging app which integrates Google's virtual assistant does not feature important privacy measures that the tech firm said it would have. Speaking in a series of tweets, the security expert said that the app should be completely avoided.  Google has been criticized for not including the promised end-to-end encryption in the app when it first launched and reportedly storing messages indefinitely. Allo is 'A Google app that records every message you ever send and makes it available to police upon request,' said Snowden.

Home Opinion What differentiates humans from computers? Not much, Google reports What differentiates humans from computers? Not much, Google reports What really differentiates us from computers? Not much, if a new paper from Google is anything to go by. By: The Financial Express | Published: March 17, 2017 4:30 AM DeepMind now, much like humans, can remember how it completed a certain task in the past and solve problems. (Reuters) What really differentiates us from computers? Not much, if a new paper from Google is anything to go by. Although there is no doubt that computers are getting smarter, they are still behind humans in certain tasks. But new research from Google seems to have bridged that gap to some extent. Published on Tuesday, the Google paper unveils how the digital giant taught its DeepMind artificial intelligence (AI) system to initiate continual learning, so that the computer could learn like humans from past experiences. While humans use systems consolidation and synaptic consolidation—the process of imprinting on slow-learning parts and memorising—Google took the same process to create an algorithm called Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC). DeepMind now, much like humans, can remember how it completed a certain task in the past and solve problems. But what it cannot do is solve any new problems that humans still can. So, Google has been able to develop selective cognition. But given how technology is progressing, even that may not be far away. Although developing a smart AI is still some time away, we are reaching a stage where it can move beyond mundane tasks and do something more constructive. Whether it will be able to displace the human connect or how many human jobs it would make redundant is anybody’s guess. Please Wait while comments are loading...

A clever broadcast chap  who in 20 years at the BBC climbed to the top of the slippery pole, starting as a trainee and ending as editor of BBC2’s flagship Newsnight programme? PA:Press Association 9 Peter Barron defending his Google paymasters as a group of MPs probe hate speech on the tech giant’s social media platforms Or does he see the true Barron, a man who joined Google because the pay was so good, ditching his morality and being prepared to be humiliated in public to defend his paymasters? It is, of course, the latter. He finally hit rock-bottom in Parliament the other day when, as Google’s vice president of communications, he was wheeled in front of a committee of MPs looking at hate crimes on social media. Getty Images 9 Google owns YouTube which carried a video from David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, entitled: ‘Jews admit organising white genocide’ Google owns YouTube which carried a video from David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, entitled: “Jews admit organising white genocide”. Duke says in the film: “The Zionists have already ethnically cleansed the Palestinians. Why not do the same thing to the Europeans and Americans as well?” YouTube failed to remove two other videos posted by the proscribed neo-Nazi group National Action, which celebrated the murder of Jo Cox Since the Palestinian suggestion is wholly untrue and it was Europe which tried to ethnically cleanse the Jews, you would have thought Barron — with his journalistic sense of doing the right thing — would  have agreed it was disgusting and should be taken down. Oh no. Read this crap from him.  He told MPs the video was “anti-Semitic, deeply offensive and shocking” but did not constitute hate speech although he acknowledged it was “right on the borderline”. That’s good of him. PA:Press Association 9 YouTube failed to remove two other videos posted by the proscribed neo-Nazi group National Action, which celebrated the murder of Jo Cox Further, YouTube failed to remove two other videos posted by the proscribed neo-Nazi group National Action, which celebrated the murder of Jo Cox. Google gets away with it, both as a monopoly and a sophisticated global tech company, by claiming there is nothing it can do to stop vile things being uploaded.  That’s why it employs the likes of Barron to lie about hate speech on its behalf. Gay schoolboy dies weeks after making passionate anti-bullying YouTube video His descent from the heady heights of the editor’s chair to Google’s chief ­whopper-teller would surely make a ­seven-minute package for Newsnight any night of the week. Google used to boast “don’t be evil”. Not only do they do evil, they hire people like Barron to PR evil. I’D love to live in a country where there was free university tuition, free prescriptions, free care for the elderly. Oh, I’ve found one — it’s called Jockistan and it’s the mugs from down south who subsidise these freeloaders with money the Scots are incapable of creating themselves. The oil’s run out — so should they. Phil must pay for tax fiasco PHILIP HAMMOND is a Remainer but he can’t remain in his job. If No10 is to be believed (and there is a question mark on that) they warned Hammond on at least two occasions that his beloved self-employed tax would be a problem but he brushed aside their concerns as “financially illiterate”. Reuters 9 Philip Hammond is a Remainer but he can’t remain in his job, says Kelvin He was wrong and he will have to pay the price, as his error will be a problem for Mrs May long after the brickies and chippies  (and self-employed columnists!) have calmed down. This is the real issue: Rebel Tories now know that when they flex their muscles they can humiliate a Chancellor and will feel emboldened to threaten defeat on any one of a thousand Brexit issues. It’s a nightmare for Mrs May. She needs somebody at No11 who sings from her hymn sheet if she is to steer her way through the landmines of Brexit and Scotland over the next few years. Hammond’s lack of judgment has been exposed and, for the first time in his political life, he should be a Leaver – and leave  right now. Spirit of manifesto commitments not met says Philip Hammond Meanwhile, if Mrs May wants to find the alleged £2billion for social care now missing because of the Budget defeat, why not take it out of the £12billion overseas aid bill? Surely our old dears in Sunderland are as important as those from Somalia? Discuss. A waist of time for ladies I WAS astonished and quite pleased (as were manufacturers of king-sized beds) to see the way the shape of women has changed over the past six decades. According to official stats, back in the 1950s the average adult female weight was 9st 10lb (today it’s 11st), waist 27.5in (34in), bust 34B (36DD) and dress size 12 (16). These pictures of a young Joan Collins and Kim Kardashian  illustrate my point. Rex Features 9 A young Joan Collins... back in the 1950s the average adult female weight was 9st 10lb Rex Features 9 Kim Kardashian... today the average female weight is 11st, with a waist of 34in, bust at 36DD and a dress size of 16 However I’d be grateful if the ladies might stop their breakfast consumption of Krispy Kremes and a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, as I have done my own rather worrying research on what they might look like in another 60 years. At this rate, by 2077 their dress size (on the same mathematical basis) will have grown from size 16  to size 22, with waists going from 34in to 42in, which in turn will lead to legislative change. Cavendish Press/Bluebella 9 How the average female body has changed over the past 6 decades The first is that someone will be appointed to walk with a red flag in front of women and, second, burkas will become mandatory. Complaints about this article should not go to Ipso but to Fatso. Thank you. Five go back to the bookshop SO I was wrong. For years I have predicted the e-reader would see off the printed book. But look at this. Printed book sales are up seven per cent, driven by greater reading among youngsters, while e-book sales declined by four per cent. 9 The reason for the jump is that youngsters have been buying the very funny spoof Five books The reason for the jump is that youngsters have been buying the very funny spoof Five books (Five Go Gluten Free, Five On Brexit Island, etc) plus the Ladybird series How It Works: The Husband and The Ladybird Book Of The Hangover. And the reason e-readers  are on the decline is that bookworms are turning to  other devices such as tablets and mobiles. Who would have believed a decade ago that you would read War And Peace on your smartphone? A fascinating chapter. PAT ON THE BACK HAVE received a nice pat on the back from column reader Heather Maguire, who has an 18-year-old granddaughter, Talor, in West Lulworth, Dorset. She said in her email: “Thanks to you, my granddaughter has made a massive saving on her car insurance renewal. “At 18 we knew we would have to pay a bit more but Premium Choice wanted £6,500 – an increase of £5,000 on last year. “So we went on your A Spokesman Said price comparison site and got cover from Admiral for £1,028.” Incredible. There are shocking try-ons in the insurance world so do come to me, or anybody else, before renewing. I love your saving stories. Do send more to kelvin@the-sun.co.uk.

Brooks is a hero to the homeless I TIP my hat to my good friend Brooks Newmark, a former Conservative junior minister, for being the driving political force behind the Centre For Social Justice report revealing there are 35,000 people sleeping rough in England. Getty Images 9 Brooks Newmark, a former Conservative junior minister, the driving political force behind a report revealing there are 35,000 people sleeping rough in England The report urges the creation of housing for rough sleepers, saying that although it would cost £110million it would save double that with them not ending up in prison or hospital. Brutal moment homeless man is drenched in petrol and set alight Brooks told me: “Finding somewhere to live is the first step on the road to recovery.” I agree with him.

Gekko blame Australia not Google. Jason Berek-Lewis I’m not really sure what you mean by ‘blame Australia not Google.’ There are many Google and other internet services that are US exclusive. A key point of the Internet is to break down geographical barriers, but not in the case of Google Voice.. Gekko my point is – your country’s anti-capitalistic telecom laws are probably to blame. James_75 Are there actually countries out there that have pro-capitalistic telecom laws?? Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Somolia? tmmacara The crazy thing (or at least one of the crazy things) is that when you try to make a phone call from the desktop web interface, it only allows ringing the call on one of your linked numbers or web calling via Hangouts.

Ivan92116 still no update to the Chrome extension 🙁 Gekko yup. desperately needed. ddevito Web calling was already available…??? tmmacara I’m not sure if you are making a statement or asking a question. I will guess that you are asking, “Wasn’t web calling already available?” If I remember correctly, it was already available (and still is) on the legacy Google Voice desktop web interface but not the new desktop web interface. Now with this update, it is. And, more specifically, what Google is calling, “Calling on the web”, means initiate the call from the new desktop web interface and then actually complete the call on one of your linked numbers or Hangouts. ddevito I’m pretty sure it was already in the refreshed UI version already, I used it a few times.

Words to go: Containers in cloud computing by Kathleen Casey Assistant Site Editor It's hard to talk about cloud today without mentioning containers. Whether you're new to the technology or a seasoned pro, know these key terms related to containers in the cloud.

Containers have been around for a while, but Docker recently helped bring them into the spotlight for enterprise use. As the cloud evolves, more enterprises see the benefits of adopting hybrid and multicloud models, but it's a challenge to ensure software runs reliably when moved from one environment to another. Containers have come to the rescue by wrapping an application and all its components into a single, more portable package. And, with the growing popularity of containers in cloud computing, major providers, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure and Google, offer container services and orchestration tools to manage container creation and deployment. But before you start to box up your processes, get familiar with these key terms for containers: Application containerization: Containerization -- also known as container-based virtualization -- is a distributed application deployment model that offers an alternative to launching a VM for each application. Isolated environments, called containers, instead run on a single control host and share the same OS kernel. Compared to traditional virtualization, containerization allows for greater efficiency for memory, CPU and storage. Because organizations can create containers more quickly than they could hypervisor-based instances, containers also encourage a more agile environment, promoting continuous delivery methods as well as the use of microservices. Containers as a service (CaaS): Cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure and Google, offer container-based virtualization as a service, providing orchestration, management and compute resources for containerized applications. This model, known as CaaS, typically consists of a Linux-based OS, a container runtime, a container orchestration tool and a container registry. Docker: Docker is an open source platform that enables the deployment of Linux applications as containers. Docker containers can run in multiple locations including VMs, bare-metal servers, and public cloud instances. Major cloud providers, including AWS, Azure and Google, support Docker containers. Google Kubernetes: Kubernetes is Google's container management system for public, private and hybrid clouds. The open source system manages deployment and scaling for Docker and Rocket containers, and also has tools for orchestration and load balancing tools. Like they support Docker, AWS, Google and Azure support the Kubernetes system. Developers can move Kubernetes container workloads across cloud platforms without having to alter the code. Google Container Engine (GKE): GKE is an orchestration and cluster management system for Docker containers in cloud computing. The clusters consist of a group of Google Compute Engine instances that run Kubernetes. GKE provides access to the Google Container Registry to store and access private Docker images. Stackdriver Logging and Stackdriver Monitoring are also available to monitor the health of the applications. Microsoft Windows Containers: Microsoft Windows Containers are isolated container environments in Windows Server 2016. Two types of containers are supported: Windows Server Containers and Hyper-V Containers. Organizations can manage these containers with Docker, PowerShell or Azure, and integrate them with existing Windows technologies. Azure Container Service (ACS): ACS is an open source orchestration system based on Apache Mesos that can manage fleets of containers in cloud computing. The service supports DC/OS, Docker Swarm and Kubernetes to scale and orchestrate. Because of open source components in the orchestration layers, applications are fully portable. Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS): Amazon ECS is a container management service that supports Docker containers and runs applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. Users create and manage Docker containers through a set of APIs. The service evaluates and monitors CPU usage and supports its own open source scheduler, AWS Blox, as well as third-party schedulers. Users also have access to other Amazon EC2 features through API calls, such as Elastic Load Balancing, security groups and identity and access management roles. Amazon EC2 Container Registry is integrated with Amazon ECS to manage, store and deploy Docker container images. Open Container Initiative (OCI): OCI is a collaborative project to establish common standards for containers. The project is hosted under the Linux Foundation, and is independent from commercial organizations. Currently, OCI has two specifications: the Runtime Specification and the Image Specification. Members of the OCI include vendors such as AWS, Google, Microsoft and IBM.

Roston - Mar 16, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google has announced what it calls a ‘quality of life improvement’ for Gmail on desktop, one that enables users to view the contents of a video attachment without actually downloading the video itself. This is made possible using the same infrastructure behind Google Drive, YouTube, and some other products, according to Google. The feature is rolling out now. Google announced the feature today, saying it is only available when using Gmail on desktop. The feature aims to make it easier to check out the contents of a video attached to an email by bringing a streaming preview directly within the email. Users can view the attached video’s thumbnail and stream the preview directly. This is a welcomed feature for two reasons: it saves users time and enables them to decide whether the video attachment is worth downloading at all. Previously, the user had to download the attachment and then open it with a video player to see what it contained. With this feature, the video content can be played directly. The feature is being rolled out with scheduled and rapid release — it should make its way to all users within the next 15 days to all G Suite editions. This is the latest of multiple updates added to Gmail in recent weeks — find out about the others in the timeline below!

Copyright 2017 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next BASEHOR, Kan. - A four-legged counselor has made her way to Glenwood Ridge Elementary School in Basehor, Kansas.  Her name is Google and the two-year-old black lab is a facility dog. “Google and I see a lot of kids who are dealing with anxiety issues and so we teach coping skills to help get them through their day,” school counselor Wendy Cook said. Google who was trained by the Kansas Specialty Dog Service (KSDS), works with Cook, helping students with their social skills. "She helps me teach character lessons, she helps me in individual and group counseling. She just makes kids feel great about themselves. She offers unconditional love and acceptance. It just helps them get through the stress of their day,” Cook said. “Kids are under so much stress these days and Google and I see a lot of kids who are dealing with anxiety issues." To lower that anxiety, Google interacts with the students to help them be more confident in the classroom and take on the school day. “Google brings joy to everyone's faces,” fifth grader Cole Borders said. “She just makes everyone happy. If you're having a bad morning, she really cheers you up when you're ready to learn." “Say you’re in the car line, she’s out there with Ms. Cook, you’re dragging because it’s a Monday, but then you see Google and it just makes you happy,” fifth grader Nash McCarty said. From the classroom visits, to the counselor’s office, Google interacts with several students both at Glenwood Ridge Elementary and Linwood Elementary. “She’s like a bridge to reach children,” Cook said. “She really helps build report if kids feel uncomfortable coming to the counselor. So they're able to share their feelings a lot easier." It's estimated that it costs $25,000 to train facility dogs like Google. KSDS does not charge, and is a non profit organization that depends on donations. Cook says it’s something she and the district are very thankful for. And how did Google get her name? KSDS has themes each year for the litter. This year’s theme was the Internet. If you’d like to more about KSDS facility dogs, click here. ------   Rae Daniel can be reached at Rae.Daniel@KSHB.com.

Name: Subject: Message: You can delete conversations in Google Voice with latest update Newsby John Callaham2 days ago 2 322 15 In late January, Google released a major new update to its Google Voice app for Android, iOS and the web. The update was mainly to introduce a new user interface. Today, the app is getting yet another big update that actually adds a few new features, including a way to finally delete entire conversations. See also: Google Voice to add VoIP integration in the future January 26, 2017 Google Voice users have been able to delete individual messages for a while, but the ability to get rid of entire conversations should be a big time saver for many folks. The process is simple: just click on the conversation you want to get rid of, then click “More” and finally click “Delete”. Keep in mind that once this action is done, the conversation is gone forever; there’s no recycle bin feature. This is just for Android and the web apps for now; iOS Google Voice users will get this feature in the near future. Android users can also toggle “Do Not Disturb” on or off. When this feature is turned on, all calls and text message forwarding will be paused. Also, a banner will let users know that it’s been turned on. While you can set a timer to automatically turn Do Not Disturb on or off, you will still have to enable that small feature by going to the Legacy Google Voice site on the web. Two more features added to the Android app include the ability to disable app notifications for text messages and a way to long-press on a conversation in the messages list so it can be archived. The Google Voice app can now be used to search for Gif image files if you have the Gboard keyboard installed. Finally, the updated web version of Google Voice can now be used to make a call to any number or person on your contact list.

Several users on Reddit have noticed the audio ad and Bryson Meunier posted a clip to Twitter. Some Android users also reported hearing the ad through Google Assistant on mobile. And from the Total Bullshit Dpt., also known as Google PR: This wasn’t intended to be an ad. What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case. It was an ad, plain and simple. A corporate statement like this, which is clearly, utterly, 100% a lie, should be illegal, and punishable by massive fines. This kind of callous behaviour is a disgrace.

Just don’t call it an ad. On Thursday, Bryson Meunier, an online search executive at digital ticket seller Vivid Seats LLC, tweeted a video of his Google Home internet-connected speaker playing a Walt Disney Co. promotion for the new "Beauty and the Beast" movie.  Meunier says "Okay, Google, what’s my day like?" The AI-powered software talks about the weather and traffic, then says: "By the way, Disney’s live action ‘Beauty and the Beast’ opens today," followed by music and additional commentary on the movie. It’s a big moment in the history of computing -- and something Wall Street has been bugging Google parent Alphabet Inc. about lately. Google became one of the world’s most valuable companies by showing relevant text-based ads after people type text-based queries into PCs. But this ad model is ever changing as technology advances. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up When mobile phones first took off, Google created new ads suited to smaller screens. Now, it sees a future in which physical computers fade away and we speak to AI-powered software that gives us the right information at the right time. The Google Assistant, lurking inside the Google Home gadget, is an early version of this, but it presents the company with an even greater challenge without a screen for text ads. Hence the excitement on Thursday about the Disney movie promo. If Google’s Assistant is already broadcasting ads through this new medium, a new source of profit may begin flowing. That could help it keep up with Amazon.com Inc., which is already accepting potentially profitable online orders through its Echo speakers, powered by its Alexa assistant. Not so fast, according to (human) Google representatives. After Business Insider asked Google about the episode, a spokesperson said it wasn’t an ad, adding: "The beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales." Only a human could have come up with that. Fail as Old as Time When Bloomberg News asked about it, a Google spokeswoman said it wasn’t intended to be an ad, and provided a slightly different explanation. "What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content," she wrote in an email. "We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case.” So if Disney didn’t pay for the movie mention by the Google Assistant, is this the equivalent of an organic search result in Google’s new voice-based computing world? Either way, the Disney ad -- or promotion, or experience, or experiment -- has been pulled. Disney didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Google, an ad company (based on its main revenue stream), is serving up ads - phrased like that it doesn't seem like a big deal. But how many of you would have expected the much-lauded Google Assistant to start telling you ads? Well, that's exactly what it's doing. If you use the daily briefing feature that you can trigger by asking "What's my day like?" you'll hear something new today. In between the summary of your commute, reminders, calendar events, weather and the presentation of the most important news, this briefing has an ad. New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 The Assistant tells you that, "by the way", the new Beauty and the Beast remake is out today. One Google Home owner has recorded the ordeal and embedded that recording on Twitter, see above. People using the daily briefing functionality on phones with Google Assistant have also heard the ad, though it seems to be much more widespread on Google Home devices for whatever reason. At the moment there doesn't seem to be a way for you to opt out of being played ads. It's also unclear if these are going to be headed to the 'Feed' of cards on Google's launchers for Android and its eponymous app. Will there be a backlash? Let's wait and see.

The helpful AI made its debut in Google Allo and then lingered for a while as a Google Pixel exclusive. Thankfully, the online giant decided to give its partners some love and the Assistant in now part of a wide Android 6.0 and up roll-out. So, it is clearly being groomed to act as a successor to Google Now for most users. However, the original release notice only mentioned Android smartphones with no talk of tablets whatsoever. That was an easy detail to glance over, but now it's clear it was no accidental omission. A Google official clarified that tablets will not be covered by this initial Assistant release: The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play Services, this does not include tablets. This is kind of baffling and definitely a marketing decision above anything else, since there is not much difference on a software level between either class of device when equipped with Google Play Services. Still, this doesn't necessarily rule-out a tablet release at a later point in time. If you don't mind doing a bit of the work yourself you can always edit your Android build.prop file and have Assistant up and running in no time. After all, lying a little bit to an AI can't be all that bad.

Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images This post originally appeared in Business Insider. As Google moves toward screen-free computing powered by digital assistants and artificial intelligence, one of the big questions the company faces is how it'll translate its lucrative advertising to those platforms. Advertisement Now we're starting to get an idea. Some users of the new Google Home connected speaker have noticed audio ads for Disney's upcoming "Beauty and the Beast" remake. Here's a clip of the ad, taken by a Google Home user and posted to Twitter. The ad comes after the user gets an update on his day from the Google Assistant: New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO— brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 Now here's the rub. A Google spokesperson told Business Insider that the ad you just heard isn't an ad. Advertisement "This isn't an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales," the spokesperson said in a statement. We're as confused as you are by that one. The spokesperson did not respond when asked to clarify. Google CEO Sundar Pichai was asked multiple times by analysts on the company's last earnings call about how he plans to monetize voice-first products like Google Home. Pichai didn't have a clear answer, sticking to his common refrain that it's still "early days" for the technology. He also said voice is only "one mode" to control computers and "users will have many different ways by which they interact" with Google products.

Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Uber Is This the Beginning of the End for Uber? Google is accusing Uber of stealing trade secrets in a lawsuit that could destroy Uber’s future. by Maya KosoffMarch 16, 2017 5:57 pm Email Facebook Twitter By Eric Risberg/A.P./Rex/Shutterstock. The same take-no-prisoners, world-conquering mentality that fueled Uber’s rise, from a scrappy ride-hailing service to a $68 billion tech behemoth, suddenly seems like it could be the company’s undoing. Over the past several weeks, Uber has been rocked by a series of scandals, beginning with its clumsy response to Donald Trump’s travel ban—which led some 200,000 customers to delete their accounts—and culminating in reports that it had used proprietary software to evade government regulators. In between, the company was accused of turning a blind eye to allegations of sexual harassment and fostering a chauvinistic work environment. C.E.O. Travis Kalanick, who was recently captured on video berating an Uber driver, has since acknowledged that his company’s culture needs to change, and that he needs leadership help. Investors are confident that Uber can overcome its recent spate of bad press. But speculation is building in Silicon Valley that Uber may yet face a more existential threat: a lawsuit, filed in late February by Alphabet, that accuses Uber’s subsidiary, Otto, of stealing self-driving car technology from its own driverless car spin-off, Waymo. It’s a familiar sort of story in the tech industry, where gifted engineers have a habit of wandering off to start their own companies. According to the lawsuit, Anthony Levandowski, a former member of Google’s self-driving car team, stole Waymo’s proprietary LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor technology when he left in early 2016 to co-found Otto. That technology, the suit alleges, eventually found its way to Uber when Otto was suddenly acquired, just months after its launch, for an astounding $680 million. The smoking gun, according to Google, was an e-mail—intended for Uber but sent to Waymo in error—that included schematics bearing a “striking resemblance” to Waymo’s own LiDAR sensors. The e-mail confirmed Google’s suspicions that Levandowski had taken proprietary information with him, and the company filed suit a few weeks later. “We will have a chance to tell our side of the story in upcoming filings and look forward to that opportunity,” an Uber spokesperson told The Hive. While sources in Silicon Valley say Uber’s sexist “brogrammer” culture isn’t likely to hurt the company in the long term, an injunction from Google would be something else entirely. Driverless cars are the lynchpin of Uber’s path to profitability, which has thus far remained elusive. The reasoning behind acquiring Otto, Kalanick said in an interview last year, “starts with understanding that the world is going to go self-driving and autonomous.” If Uber can’t be among the first to market with a self-driving car, he conceded, “then the future passes us by, basically, in a very expeditious and efficient way.” If Alphabet were to succeed in its suit, it’s possible that it could force Uber to scuttle its self-driving car program and start from scratch. For a company losing well over a billion dollars a year, such a setback could prove devastating. Uber can afford to pay a hefty sum to Alphabet, according to people close to Uber. But a prolonged battle over intellectual property could drain morale and talent even before the LiDAR case reaches a conclusion. “While I think that the public’s attention span can be short, the continued number of Uber executives leaving is making the perception more of a reality for the company,” one investor told me. “Add in the reports of them losing money hand over first and they might end up being a bust, which is something I can’t believe. A couple of years ago I thought Uber had the potential to become the logistics company of the future.” Others were more sanguine. Uber “already had made it,” one Valley insider said, when asked whether Uber would pull through, while another said Uber would be a $100 billion company when it goes public in the future. “It will remain a force,” a separate source, a prominent venture capitalist, said. “There is no going back.” Still, he conceded, the Securities and Exchange Commission could be a problem if it turns out that Uber knew about potential conflicts before acquiring Otto. While Silicon Valley was closing ranks, Waymo was moving ahead with plans to stop Uber in its tracks, amending its lawsuit last week to ask for an injunction against Uber’s use of its self-driving technology. The case, as Google describes it, appears damning. According to a heavily redacted written declaration by Google engineer Pierre-Yves Droz—who, along with Levandowski and Andrew Schultz, founded the company that became the basis for Google’s own self-driving-car project—Levandowski was vocal about his plan to create his own company. “I distinctly remember taking a walk around our Mountain View office one-on-one with Mr. Levandowski on or around January 5, 2016,” he said. “During this walk, he told me specifically that he wanted his new company to have a long-range LiDAR, which is very useful for self-driving truck applications he was interested in,” Droz continued. “He also told me that he planned to ‘replicate’ this Waymo technology at his new company.” This followed a conversation Droz recalled having with Levandowski, in which Levandowski said he’d met with Uber executive Brian McClendon, who was overseeing Uber’s self-driving-car project. “Later in January 2016, a colleague told me that Mr. Levandowski had been seen at Uber’s headquarters in mid January,” Droz said. “I asked Mr. Levandowski about this, and he admitted he had met with Uber, and the reason he was there was that he was looking for investors for his new company.” If Levandowski had, in fact, been in talks with Uber as early as 2015, it would not have been out of character. Like Kalanick, Levandowski reportedly has a reputation for breaking the rules to turn his ideas into reality. He grew impatient when Google delayed putting its cars on the road, Bloomberg reports, and hired a lobbyist in Nevada to write a new law that would let companies like Google test-drive autonomous vehicles in the state. Google only found out about the lobbying efforts when the company received an invoice from his hired lobbyist, David Goldwater. Uber, too, has often found it easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. In 2014, the company was raked over the coals after one executive was revealed to have tracked a journalist’s ride using an internal God View tool, while another allegedly suggested that Uber should do opposition research on critical reporters. It didn’t help Uber’s reputation, but it didn’t stop Kalanick from going on to raise several billion dollars more in funding. Uber is also hardly the first Silicon Valley giant to be accused of stealing technology from a competitor. Earlier this year, Facebook was ordered to pay $500 million to a gaming company called ZeniMax, when Oculus, which C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg acquired several years earlier, was found guilty of nondisclosure agreement violation and copyright infringement. But Uber isn’t being sued by a smaller company: it’s going up against Alphabet, the world’s most valuable tech company with a market capitalization of nearly $600 billion. The financial ramifications are totally different now, too. Facebook would have survived if a court ruled that it had to shut down Oculus. Uber, if it was forced to restart its self-driving car program, might not. Additional reporting by Nick Bilton.

Google agreed to pay $2.2 million, which would have been awarded to the lawsuit attorneys. None of the settlement would have been made available to consumers. In addition, Judge Lucy Koh found the agreement failed to clearly inform consumers about Google's email scanning practices.  Read: Google Agrees To Change Email Scanning Process To Avoid Privacy Lawsuit "This notice is difficult to understand and does not clearly disclose the fact that Google intercepts, scans and analyzes the content of emails sent by non-Gmail users to Gmail users for the purpose of creating user profiles of the Gmail users to create targeted advertising for the Gmail users," Koh wrote as part of a six-page order. The case stems from an ongoing legal challenge to Google over its practice of scanning incoming emails sent to Gmail users. During the scan, a process that takes just fractions of a second to complete, the company gleans information from the contents of the message, which is used by the company's ad-targeting system. Critics of the practice have questioned the search giant, claiming that its scans are a form of illegal wiretapping and are in violation of California privacy laws. While Google's system is automated and doesn't allow employees to read emails, privacy advocates have argued the scans are equivalent to a phone company listening to phone calls to gather information about subscribers.  The practice is allowed for emails sent and received by Gmail users, as it is disclosed in the company's terms of service. However, senders communicating with Gmail users have not agreed to allow their messages to be scanned by the company. Read: Yahoo Spying On Emails: Edward Snowden Urges Users To Close Account After Reuters Intelligence Report Google agreed to voluntarily change its scanning practice as part of the legal settlement originally agreed to in December 2016. The company agreed to continue to pre-screen emails for virus protection and spam filtering purposes, but would postpone the advertising-related scan until after the email becomes accessible in a user's inbox. In her decision to reject the settlement, Judge Koh argued that Google does not clearly explain its workaround and said it was not clear if the change would be enough to bring Google into compliance with wiretapping laws.  The parties will have to renegotiate a settlement for the case—likely one that requires Google to further publicize its email scanning practices and provides compensation for users who may have been affected by the scans.

Alphabet Inc. filed a lawsuit against Uber in February, alleging the company’s autonomous vehicle systems are based on intellectual property stolen by Otto CEO Anthony Levandowski during his time at Google, according to Bloomberg. Google reportedly began investigating him during the summer when Otto, his self-driving truck company, was purchased by Uber for $700 million just a month after opening its doors. While heading the lidar team for Google’s driverless car program — now Waymo — the suit claims the investigation revealed Levandowski downloaded 14,000 design files from his work laptop to a memory card. After the suit was filed, Levandowski reportedly defended himself at an Uber company meeting, saying he downloaded the files in question to work from home. However, Google noted he wiped the data from his laptop shortly after downloading them. The most potentially damning bit of evidence, though, comes from an email Google reportedly received from one of its suppliers Dec. 13. The email, which had the subject line”Otto Files,” included drawings of a lidar circuit board that was nearly itentical to Google’s. These allegations add to what’s already been a fairly rough year for Uber. It is being sued for alleged sexual discrimination, admitted to using a software program to avoid law enforcement and its CEO Travis Kalanick was caught on video arguing with one of its drivers. Mounting frustration with Kalanick’s company also caused many to boycott Uber in response to his participation in a forum that’s advising President Donald Trump on economic policies. Other major CEOs such as Tesla’s Elon Musk, General Motors’ Mary Barra, Ford’s Mark Fields and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ Sergio Marchionne are also members of the forum, and their companies haven’t faced nearly as much sustained backlash.

Google launches location extension display ads for local businesses Some other display ads may be converted automatically to the new format when users are nearby. Ginny Marvin on March 16, 2017 at 12:56 pm More Google debuted a new display ad format on the Google Display Network this week to showcase local business information. The new location extension ad format rolled out in AdWords on Tuesday. The new ad format shows photos, store location and business hours, as well as an ad headline and copy as shown in the ad below.  The ad for a local bakery may show to a nearby user reading a cooking blog, for example. Google says that in testing, 60 percent of clicks on the extension info were to get directions or more information about a store location. Location extension data can now show on the Google Display Network. Creating Location extension ads The new format is an option in the ad gallery in AdWords under general purpose ads, where advertisers can upload up to three images, a logo and an ad headline and description. To set up new display campaigns with location extensions: Check “Extend my ads with location information.” To show location extension ads only to people who are physically located around your stores — not people who are interested in your local area — click Location options (advanced) and select “People in my target location.” Ads may be converted automatically Text, responsive and 300×250 image ads, in particular, can be dynamically converted to the new location extension format when users are nearby, unless advertisers opt out. To opt out of location extensions in a display campaign or ad groups, select Location extensions on the Extensions tab in AdWords: Click + Extension. Select “Select campaigns” (or “Select ad groups”). Select one or more campaigns (or ad groups) — the ones you’d like to turn off location extensions for. Select “Use campaign location extension,” then select “Disable location extensions.

Unfortunately, if what seems like an ad discovered today on the device is any indication, the magic may very quickly fade as your personal assistant takes detours from your daily calendar to promote products. The “ad” in question (which Google claims is not an ad, hence the quotes) is for Beauty and the Beast, and a Google Home owner posted this clip of it interrupting a daily briefing: New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO — brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 The “ad” says, “By the way, Disney’s live action Beauty and The Beast opens today. In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer if you ask me. For some more movie fun, ask me something about Belle.” Others have noticed the “ad,” which doesn’t seem to simply be a spontaneous conversation topic plucked from something like search history, as you might expect from Google—although even if it were, it might still be a paid ad, as well. Google’s response doesn’t exactly inspire confidence, either, as they reportedly told The Verge simply, “This isn’t an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales.” Anyone who knows anything about Beauty and the Beast will easily pick up on the references in the statement, and saying it’s not an “ad” but instead mentioning “partners” seems like a bit of PR doublespeak. Of course, Google is well known for making money through ads, and it’s likely they need to find a way to keep the Home’s capabilities funded after the initial purchase, so I can’t really fault them. Still, audio ads interrupting the device’s basic functions could be a deterrent to potential buyers, and existing Home owners may not be too happy about this new development. If enough people decide they don’t want to sit around waiting through audio ads in the middle of using a device meant to be convenient, that could be trouble for the Google Home’s future.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 SEARCH Security Yahoo Hacking Case Won't Help Divide Between Tech, Government Department of Justice officials announced they had charged four people — two officers of the Russian Federal Security Service and two hackers the Russian government employed — in connection with the 2014 Yahoo security breach. by Marissa Lang and Wendy Lee, San Francisco Chronicle / March 16, 2017 0 Flickr/Eric Miraglia (TNS) -- Implicit in federal agents’ expression of gratitude to tech giants Yahoo and Google for helping them tie two Russian spies and a pair of hackers to a massive email breach in 2014 was an overture to the rest of Silicon Valley: If you work with us, federal agents seemed to say, we can better defend against foreign attacks. But those niceties, which accompanied the indictments of four alleged cyberspies Wednesday, may fall on deaf ears. The long-standing tension between the federal government and American technology companies has reached new heights in recent months, security experts said, and it will take more than one successful investigation to mend it. Bay Area tech firms are still reeling from several revelations that show Russia may not be the only government hacking into their products. Just last week, a cache of stolen CIA documents leaked by activist group WikiLeaks revealed espionage tactics that U.S. agents may have used to hack into numerous Silicon Valley consumer products, including the iPhone and Google’s Android software. RELATEDThe 'Poetic' Ending for Yahoo500 Million Yahoo Accounts HackedNSA Director Denies Mass Scanning of Yahoo Emails Companies from small startups to multimillion-dollar venture capital firms have denounced several policies put forth by the Trump administration. President Trump himself has been a vocal critic of the Bay Area tech scene, calling for heightened pressure on tech firms to comply with government investigations and build back doors to allow agents to crack into personal devices protected by passwords. Meanwhile the threat from other nations and hackers continues to mount. Russia’s involvement in the Yahoo hack that affected at least 500 million accounts was not terribly surprising to many cybersecurity experts, who noted that nation states increasingly are targeting private companies, seeking personal and corporate secrets. Caught in the middle are consumers, both American and international, whose personal lives, data and information may not be as secure as it could be as long as the trust and information-sharing between the private and public sector continues to erode. “They can do a better job together than they can do at each other’s throats,” said Robert Cattanach, a partner at law firm Dorsey & Whitney and a former attorney with the Department of Justice. “But tech companies don’t trust that the government — especially after what they learned from the CIA documents — won’t turn around and use the information they provide against their users. They’re going to need to take small steps to rebuild some of that trust.” On Wednesday, Department of Justice officials announced they had charged four people — two officers of the Russian Federal Security Service and two hackers the Russian government employed — in connection with the 2014 Yahoo security breach. The incident, which the company disclosed last year, is believed to be the nation’s second-largest security breach, topped only by another Yahoo hack that affected more than 1 billion users in 2013. Officials have not yet determined who was behind that that attack. Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, two operatives with the Kremlin’s Federal Security Service, targeted the accounts of diplomats, journalists, Russian officials and critics of the Kremlin in their digital raid, according to the court documents. They employed the help of known cybercriminals Alexsey Belan of Russia and Karim Baratov, a Canadian resident, to steal information from computers of American email service companies. Belan also used his access to search and take gift card and credit card numbers from email accounts and redirected traffic on Yahoo’s search engine, officials said. The hackers also used information they acquired to access a number of Google Gmail accounts, including those of high-ranking Russian officials, according to the indictment. Baratov was arrested in Canada Tuesday. The department has issued arrest warrants for Dokuchaev, Sushchin and Belan, all of whom are unlikely to be arrested given Russia’s lack of an extradition agreement with the United States. The cyberspying charges, the first ever brought against Russian security operatives, are largely symbolic, officials conceded. “With these charges, the Department of Justice is continuing to send the powerful message that we will not allow individuals, groups, nation states or a combination of them to compromise the privacy of our citizens, the economic interests of our companies or the security of our country,” said Mary McCord, acting assistant attorney general. The government’s willingness to bring its investigation to court also means it is confident in the evidence, said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist for the Center on Democracy and Technology. It is evidence that cybersecurity experts said they’d like to see but probably won’t, said Adam M. Segal, director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations. “For cybersecurity insiders to trust what they’re saying, they want to see all the evidence ... and the government is not going to do that,” said Segal. “We do reach a point where the U.S. government says we can’t reveal any more info and you’ll have to take our word on it. “The problem with that, for Silicon Valley and international audiences, is do we want to set a standard that the Russians and Chinese can say the same thing? ‘Oh yes, we have the evidence. Just trust us.’ I do think the government is trying to address this by releasing more information.” Wednesday’s charges, which were handed down by a San Francisco grand jury, are not related to accusations of Russian interference in the U.S. election or the hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s emails, though national security experts have said Russia’s Federal Security Service seems to have been involved in those attacks as well. The Democratic National Convention’s emails were breached last year by Russian hackers, allowing them to gain access to messages and chats, including opposition research on President Donald Trump. John Podesta, who served a campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, also had his personal email breached. “It is very important for corporations around the country to know that when you are going against the resources and backing of a nation state, it is not a fair fight, and it is not a fight you are likely to win alone,” McCord said. “But you do not have to go it alone. We can put the full capabilities of the United States behind you to make cases like this, but we cannot do it without your help.” Yahoo said it was “committed” to keeping its users’ data safe and would “continue to engage with law enforcement.” No other tech companies immediately responded to the Department of Justice’s overtures. Bennett of the FBI called Yahoo “great partners” over the two-year investigation, specifically citing CEO Marissa Mayer, who he said demonstrated “leadership and courage while under pressure from many entities.” San Francisco FBI agents led the investigation, according to Justice Department officials. That, Cattanach said, may serve as a stepping stone to bettering relationships with tech companies. “You have people at the FBI who have been working with folks at Yahoo and Google. And it’s all about personal relationships,” he said. “There may not be institutional trust, but I think on occasion you’ll have some individual trust. And that might be the only way to make progress here.” ©2017 the San Francisco Chronicle Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

And apparently it can play ads now, too. Several Google Home users report that their smart speaker served them an ad for the new Beauty and the Beast movie today. Twitter user Bryson Muenier recorded the ad as it played during his Google Home daily summary. “By the way, Disney’s live action Beauty and the Beast opens today,” the Google Home says after telling Muenier about the weather. “In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer if you ask me.” The Home then suggested Bryson ask to hear more about Belle, but he didn’t, so it went ahead and began serving up news like normal.

This whole situation is pretty strange. Not only is this the first time that we’ve heard anything like this from the Google Home, but it’s also weird that Google is denying that this is an ad. It may be short, but it’s definitely an ad that aims to remind people that Beauty and the Beast is now in theaters, even though some users say that they’ve never searched for the movie before.

The company on Thursday announced it would start flagging “upsetting” or “offensive” content by teaching search algorithms to better spot them. This will be made possible by tapping humans to help its computer algorithms to deliver results that are more factually accurate and less instigative, reports The Verge. The humans in this case, according to Google, are 10,000 independent contractors who work as quality raters. The independent raters were provided with search based on real queries to score the results. Their operation will be based on guidelines provided by Google. On Tuesday, Google presented the raters with a new charge; this time, to hunt for “Upsetting-Offensive” content, including hate or violence against a group of people, racial slurs or offensive nomenclature, graphic violence including cruelty to animals, child abuse or explicit information about harmful activities. In all of these, Google’s aim is to guide people with queries to websites regarded as trustworthy and not to ones that are notorious for peddling false information or hate speech. Google wants a near-perfect job—and so, just being upsetting won’t be enough for its independent raters to flag search results. The search engine giant gave an example regarding “Holocaust history” search. According to Google, one search result is a Holocaust denial site, which it says deserves the flag, while the other, a website from The History Channel, might be upsetting due to subject matter but is a “factually accurate source of historical information” and does not promote the hateful content mentioned above. Just to be clear you are not getting the whole idea wrong, what Google is saying is that being hit with the Upsetting-Offensive flag won’t immediately lead to demotion of your search results. However, it said the flags will be used as data points for employees of Google as they continue to iterate on search algorithms. As time goes on, the algorithm will learn how to independently flag content considered to be upsetting and factual. This, according to Google, would impact search rankings in cases where the search engine giant believes users are after “general learning.” Speaking to Search Engine Land on the development, the company’s search engineer Paul Haahr said: “We will see how some of this works out. I’ll be honest. We’re learning as we go … We’ve been very pleased with what raters give us in general. We’ve only been able to improve ranking as much as we have over the years because we have this really strong rater program that gives us real feedback on what we’re doing.” Good move no doubt, but getting rid of fake news from its search engine would have been a more effective way to deal with the problem. While this move is a welcome one on the part of Google, the world’s number one search engine website still has a lot to do to make its services safe for all. Got something to add to this story?

This follows hot on the heels of Uptime, an app designed to let you watch YouTube videos with friends Watch YouTube Videos With Friends Using Uptime Watch YouTube Videos With Friends Using Uptime There's a simple pleasure to be derived from watching videos with friends. But with television becoming less important, Google has launched a new social video app called Uptime. Read More . Supersonic is yet another messaging app, but one that does something interesting with emojis. Emojis are everywhere these days, and with good reason. One of the biggest problems with the web is the distinct lack of context and nuance. How many times have you said something in jest, only to have it taken seriously? Hence the need for emojis, a shorthand way of adding an extra layer of meaning to your words. No wonder Google has made them such an integral part of Supersonic. A Messaging App With a Difference Supersonic, or Supersonic Fun Voice Messenger, to give it its full title, is essentially a messaging app. You can enjoy one-on-one chats with friends, start group chats with lots of friends, or even use the Supersonic Lounge to chat to complete strangers. Conversations are all conducted via voice messages, but — here’s the clever part — Supersonic will automatically convert all of your voice messages into text messages. Supersonic will even recognize words which can be converted into emojis An Emoji to English Dictionary: Emoji Faces' Meaning, Explained An Emoji to English Dictionary: Emoji Faces' Meaning, Explained Confused by a text? Here are the commonly accepted meanings of popular emoji. Read More , and convert them for you. Recipients can either read or listen to your messages. However, taking a leaf out of Snapchat’s book, your Supersonic messages all have a short shelf life. This means that once your message has been read or heard, it will disappear forever. The already announced Uptime is currently an iOS exclusive, with no mention of an Android version in the works. However, Supersonic is available for free on Android and on iOS right now. Do We Need Another Messaging App? Supersonic is a neat little app. However, given how many messaging apps 5 Best Free Messaging Apps for Android 5 Best Free Messaging Apps for Android Need a free way to send messages to friends and family with your phone for free?

Smart Home by Dong Ngo 16 March 2017 7:10 pm GMT @riceandstirfry Google Home spouts crazy talk with fake news in answers The smart speaker is criticized for spreading conspiracy theories about President Obama and other untrue statements as part of its spoken search results. by Bridget Carey 2:10 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Google Home will now give you some information you didn't ask for. A group of Reddit users found out that their Google Home played a short commercial for "Beauty and The Beast." After giving the standard weather and daily calendar information as part of the Assistant's daily briefing, the Assistant also added "By the way, Beauty and The Beast opens in theaters today." User Bryson Meunier posted the entire experience on his Twitter account: In response to our request for comment, Google said the short audio wasn't an ad, rather just another way Google was working with partners. Later on Thursday, the company offered this additional statement: "This wasn't intended to be an ad," said a Google spokesperson. "What's circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We're continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case." So maybe it's an unintended ad. Google confirmed the "Beauty and the Beast" line has been removed from Assistant's daily briefing. So far we haven't seen this done with competing virtual assistants like Siri, Cortana or Alexa. Audio streaming services, such as Pandora, have been known to transmit advertisements. Update, 3:40 p.m. PT: Adds Google's updated statement.

New tool can be used to flag up content that might come across as 'upsetting or offensive' AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez Tech giant Google has given its army of 'quality raters' around the globe a new tool to flag up content that might come across as "upsetting or offensive". According to reports the "upsetting-offensive" content flag has been added to guidelines used by the search engine's global review teams in a bid to draw attention to potentially unsuitable content and help train Google's machine-learning systems to recognise unsuitable results. The guidelines are said to include example searches to demonstrate the feature, including one for "holocaust history" which shows two conflicting results. One result which suggests the Holocaust "didn't happen" should be marked as "upsetting-offensive" and a second example result from The History Channel, classed as a "factually accurate source of historical information", should not be flagged according to the guidelines. Google has not officially commented on the search guidelines update, but a senior engineer told industry blog Search Engine Land the company wanted to target "demonstrably inaccurate information." Engineer Paul Haahr told the blog: "We're explicitly avoiding the term 'fake news,' because we think it is too vague. "Demonstrably inaccurate information, however, we want to target." Google uses data from global quality raters to help improve search algorithms - the raters themselves do not have the power to alter Google search results but flagging results gives the system more detailed information to work from.

Tony Webster, who describes himself as a web engineer, public records researcher, and policy nerd, published a portion of the warrant out of concern that administrative subpoenas and search warrants are being used for what amounts to fishing expeditions. Under the Fourth Amendment, searches and seizures must be reasonable and as such are generally limited in their scope, to balance privacy expectations. At issue is whether a warrant for the Google account data of anyone searching for a given term is unconstitutionally broad. For Hennepin County Judge Gary Larson at least, the warrant was adequate. According to the warrant, seen in full by The Register, the case involves bank fraud in which an unknown party used the victim's name to wire $28,500 from Spire Credit Union to Bank of America. The credit union relied on a faxed copy of the victim's passport to verify the transaction, but the document was faked. The search warrant, filed by Edina Police Detective David Lindman, says that when investigators searched Google Images for the victim's name, they found the photo used to make the fake passport – an image of someone who resembled the victim but was not the same person. This led police to believe that the person responsible searched Google for the victim's name. Searches of Bing and Yahoo did not produce results, the warrant says. Reached by phone, Edina police lieutenant Timothy Olson told The Register an earlier report that investigators had sought the Google searches of everyone in Edina was "blatantly inaccurate." Olson declined to discuss what he characterized as an active case, but said the warrant was related to a felony that had been reported and that it outlined probable cause. The warrant asks for Google user information related to Google searches of the victim's name. The request was filed in "the city or township of Edina, County of Hennepin, State of Minnesota," but its extent is unlimited: anyone who searched for this particular victim using Google falls under the granted warrant. A copy of the order obtained by The Register. We've redacted the full name of the victim The warrant seeks, "any/all user or subscriber information related to the Google searches of" four variants of the victim's name over a five-week period, from December 1, 2016 through January 7, 2017. It describes the information sought as including, but not limited to: "name(s), address(es), telephone number(s), dates of birth, social security numbers, email addresses, payment information, account information, IP addresses, and MAC addresses of the person(s) who requested/completed the search." According to the warrant, Google rejected an administrative subpoena from the court. "Though Google Inc.'s rejection of the administrative subpoena is arguable," the warrant states, "[the Edina Police Department] is applying for this search warrant so that the investigation of this case does not stall." Google may not cooperate, however. The internet king has an interest in fending off overreaching governments and police to avoid becoming an on-demand data dispensary. "We aren't able to comment on specific cases, but we will always push back when we receive excessively broad requests for data about our users," a Google spokesperson said in an email to The Register. Stephanie Lacambra, EFF criminal defense staff attorney, in an email to The Register, expressed skepticism that the warrant as described will be able to survive Constitutional scrutiny. "As a former public defender for over a decade, I can say that this kind of warrant appears both unusual, in that it was approved in the first place without first establishing as a threshold matter that the suspect perpetrator used Google to obtain the photo used in the fraudulent passport in the first place, and overbroad, in that it calls for a dragnet production of the private information of all querents who searched a particular name within a five week time frame without any further limiting factors," she said. ® Editor's note: Having obtained a full copy of the warrant, and having spoken to legal experts, we have updated this story to clarify that the warrant goes beyond Edina, Minnesota – it touches everyone who used Google to search for a particular person.

Technology That Learns Like Humans Raises Safety Concerns Technology 6 0 0 March 16, 2017 Google’s DeepMind A.I. Technology That Learns Like Humans Raises Safety Concerns JohnThomas Didymus A recent breakthrough by the Google company, DeepMind, in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has raised once again concerns about the potential threat that autonomous machines that can think and learn independently pose to humanity. Many top research scientists have expressed concern in the past that fully autonomous AI could spell the end of human civilization as we know it. DeepMind recently developed AI technology that can learn the way humans learn. The company’s researchers achieved the feat by overcoming one of the major barriers that AI developers have faced over the decades, which is to teach machines how to learn like humans by applying experience acquired in a previous learning situation to a different or new learning situation. This implies the ability to build a new set of skills on the foundation of previously acquired knowledge, skills, and experience. DeepMind’s new AI program can tackle a range of tasks and achieve performance levels similar to humans by using previously acquired knowledge and skills to solve new problems. The ability to accumulate experience over time and apply previous experience to solving new problems depends in turn on the ability of the learning system to avoid forgetting old skills when confronted with new ones.

Read it here: https://t.co/Fflh56dl5p pic.twitter.com/fDDK1uh4u9 — DeepMind (@DeepMindAI) March 14, 2017 But unfortunately, previously developed AI systems were able to acquire only one set of skills. When presented with a new problem to solve, the AI simply forgets, erases or overwrites the previous set of skills and starts all over again to master the new problem without being able to draw or benefit from previous experience. AI developers term the problem “catastrophic forgetting.” Overcoming the problem of “catastrophic forgetting” has posed a huge challenge to developers for decades. “If we’re going to have computer programs that are more intelligent and more useful, then they will have to have this ability to learn sequentially,” James Kirkpatrick, an AI developer at DeepMind explained, according to the Guardian. “Humans and animals learn things one after the other and it’s a crucial factor which allows them to learn continually and to build upon their previous knowledge.” Artificial intelligence has a multitasking problem, and DeepMind might have a solution https://t.co/xNoHdiSiso pic.twitter.com/clVw5uZ2fr — Lifeboat Foundation (@lifeboathq) March 16, 2017 DeepMind’s new program can overcome the problem of “catastrophic forgetting” by simulating the way human brains learn. This makes it possible for the system to move from one task to another and use previously acquired experience to speed up the process of acquiring new skills. DeepMind researchers tested the new AI program by challenging it to learn to play popular Atari games, such as Breakout, Space Invaders, and Defender. The found that the program exhibited the ability to transfer experience gained from one learning situation to another. They published the results of their work in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. #AI #Robotics What is DeepMind AI technology? Is Google building artificial intelligence? https://t.co/r0Ho62ksaS pic.twitter.com/RVrIcmAhpt — JackVerr (@jackverr54) March 16, 2017 While the researchers were able to confirm that the AI endeavored to solve new problems by drawing from previous experience they were unable to demonstrate that the new approach improved performance in specific tasks compared with other types of programs that suffer from “catastrophic forgetting.” It appeared that operating as a general intelligence program compromised the ability to achieve very high levels of proficiency in a specific task that specialized “one-trick-pony” programs can achieve. “We have demonstrated that it can learn tasks sequentially, but we haven’t shown that it learns them better because it learns them sequentially.” Here's what happened when one of the world's best Go players took on Google's @DeepMindAI.

DeepMind can learn to play a game and then transfer that knowledge to another game. https://t.co/7BYAvJiZ5z pic.twitter.com/HTWhAYd0sV — Scott Santens (@scottsantens) March 15, 2017 Recently, DeepMind researchers announced that they observed that their AI programs sometimes resorted to violence in competitive situations. The observation was made when two of DeepMind’s AI programs competed against each other in an apple picking game. One program resorted to violent tactics as a way of a gaining a competitive edge over its opponent. Commenting on the observation, DeepMind’s Joel Leibo said that the system exhibited one of the most troubling aspects of human behavior, the tendency to resort to violence to achieve goals. “The greed motivation reflects the temptation to take out a rival and collect all the apples oneself.” The observation raised, once again, warnings by several top scientists, including the British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, that autonomous AI systems that can engage in independent thought process could pose a threat to the human race due to their ability to focus independently on deriving the most efficient solutions to specific problems. “The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race,” Hawking once told the BBC. Philosopher Nick Bostrom at the University of Oxford argued that developers would have to focus on how to establish ethical oversight over AI research projects that take humans into an uncertain future where AI will play increasing roles in human affairs. An autonomous AI system preoccupied with solving a problem could end up destroying human kind by simply focusing on solving a specific problem while ignoring the broader implications of its actions, such as in the area of ethics. This is comparable to Hitler focusing on the “Jewish problem” obsessively and obtaining the “final solution” which involved committing the crime of genocide against an entire ethnic group. “The creation of AI with the same powerful learning and planning abilities that make humans smart will be watershed moment. When eventually we get there, it will raise a host of ethical and safety concerns that will need to be carefully addressed. It is good to start to studying these in advance rather than leave all the preparation for the night before the exam.” Google’s efforts to develop more advanced AI technologies through its company DeepMind are attracting attention. DeepMind has a history of developing programs that are capable of learning how to play video games at the same skill levels as the best human players. For instance, in 2016, one of the company’s programs, AlphaGO, beat a world champion GO player, the 18-time world champion Lee Sedol. It was the first time than an AI technology beat an expert level human GO player.

Gmail Starts Streaming Video Attachments So You Don't Have to Download Them GO The feature uses the same infrastructure as YouTube & Drive Mar 16, 2017 20:47 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Gmail users will soon be able to enjoy a new feature allowing them to watch videos right within their emails.  For many years, Gmail users have enjoyed some rather great features, but they don't have it all. Google is doing its best, however, so the latest update will allow users to watch videos within Gmail, by using the same streaming infrastructure as YouTube and Google Drive. The thing is, this new feature only works if you're sending over small videos, because, as everyone knows, Gmail only permits attachments of 25MB. When it comes to video content, especially of higher quality, 25MB is easily reached even with short clips. Those larger files are automatically uploaded to Google Drive anyway, which means they can be streamed regardless if Gmail supports this feature or not. The change obviously targets smaller clips, funny videos you want to share with your friends and family of your dog chasing its tail, or your kid throwing the food bowl across the room. Now, people won't have to download the attachment anymore, and when it comes to less tech-savvy family members, that can only mean you save a lot of time you'd spend explaining how to open a downloaded file. Changes coming soon "Today, we’re rolling out a quality of life improvement to Gmail desktop users that makes previewing video attachments in Gmail much smoother and quicker. Previously, in order to view a video attachment in Gmail, you would have to download it to your computer and open it with a media player. Starting today, when opening an email with video attachments, you will see a thumbnail of the video and have the ability to stream it, right from inside Gmail," reads Google's blog post. The changes are incoming, but it might take two weeks to see them in your Inbox, depending on when Google's gradual rollout hits you. #Google#Gmail#video streaming subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Cloud Gives Customers More Options to Secure Data Facebook Faces Huge Fines over Fake News, But Says the Issue Isn't Simple Dropbox, Airbnb, 56 Other Tech Companies Fight Trump's Travel Ban 2.0 And Win - Update Gmail Lifts Incoming Email Attachment Limit to 50MB Samsung Galaxy S8 Scores the Highest on AnTuTu, Video Shows Microsoft Says Windows 10 Users Might Receive Critical Updates No Matter What New Windows 10 ISO Available for Download (Build 15058) Microsoft Launches Windows 10 Build 15061 for PCs Samsung Galaxy S8 Scores the Highest on AnTuTu, Video Shows Android O Could Feature Notification Revamp and Picture-in-Picture Microsoft Loves iPhones: OneDrive App Updated with iMessage Support Say Goodbye to Another Microsoft App on Old Windows Phones    Gmail gets a new feature Related Apps Airy: Download your favorite videos from YouTube with just a few mouse moves by using this simple and straightforward piece of software Pale Moon: Firefox-based web browser that offers fast browsing speed while retaining a traditional user-friendly interface adopted by earlier versions of Firefox YTD: Download your favorite YouTube videos to your computer and store them in whatever format you want by employing this user-friendly app CodoSoft NNTPd: Set up a news server on your computer, create newsgroups, users and user groups, managing everyone's access rights from a single location McAfee WebAdvisor: Keep your computer safe from dangerous web contend by being notified whether or not a website is safe with the help of this practical little utility Cyberfox: A customized Firefox version that allows you to quickly load all your favorite websites and navigate the Internet in a secure manner Sia-UI: Fairly interesting decentralized cloud storage solution that uses some of the latest chainblock and encryption technologies out there to protect your privacy Reader comments ExtraTorrent Loses Main Domain Name After Registrar Shuts It Down more on: ExtraTorrent i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Reports of the cockup surfaced after hundreds of users posted their frustrations on social media, Reddit, and Google Product Forums. It basically means netizens can't access their cloud storage from Google's Windows desktop client for Drive – punters can still use the web interface. The internet goliath is battling to get the outage sorted, we're told. At point one, the ad biz admitted it was aware of "a problem with Google Drive affecting a significant subset of users." Attempting to use the borked client will throw up an error that reads "Sorry, Backup and Sync needs to quit." Useful. It also apparently sports a warning that reads: "This UI is confidential. Do not leak!" Oops. "Our team is continuing to investigate this issue," Google's G Suite status page was updated to read just moments ago. "We will provide an update by 3/16/17, 2:30PM [PT] with more information about this problem. Thank you for your patience. "Some users of the Google Drive Sync client for Windows will receive the error message 'Sorry, Backup and Sync needs to quit' and will be unable to use the client. Other Sync clients are not affected. Affected users may continue using the Google Drive web interface and mobile applications. "We have identified the root cause of the issue and are implementing a potential fix now." The Windows Drive client hasn’t had a great run, and is known for being riddled with bugs and not getting much love from Google engineers. Several users have been unable to upload files in the past. The latest botched update obviously doesn’t help – and appears to be a pre-release half-finished version that was wrongly sent out and installed by autoupdating clients. @ArtemR @cryptecks @RDR0b11 Got a screenshot of this. Oops. pic.twitter.com/MLlkqp5pD1 — GreenyRepublic (@Benfclark) March 16, 2017 "Seems like Google pushed a private build of the new Google Backup and Sync (Drive) to the public. Well done Google," complained one Redditor. "A rather baffling and frustrating error to wake up to, especially given everything was functional last night," noted user Jenna Curtis on the Google Product forums. "It appears Google Drive updated to a new program called 'Backup and Sync' upon restart. Uninstalling and reinstalling the program does nothing." ® Updated to add Google has revised its status page to say: "The problem with Google Drive should be resolved. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience and continued support. "The Windows client will automatically update with this fixed version within the next 10 hours. Alternatively, affected users can download the updated version of the client from www.google.com/drive/download. Affected Windows 10 users may be required to sign in to their Google account within the client."

Machine Learning: The New Proving Ground for Competitive Advantage by MIT Technology Review Custom March 16, 2017 In partnership with A recent survey conducted by MIT Technology Review Custom and Google Cloud reveals that while the majority of businesses are struggling to apply machine learning, others are hard at work developing strategies for the technology — and are already realizing genuine ROI. Executive Summary A recent survey conducted by MIT Technology Review Custom and Google Cloud reveals that while the majority of businesses are struggling to apply machine learning, others are hard at work developing strategies for the technology — and are already realizing genuine ROI. Machine Learning: The New Proving Ground for Competitive Advantage Download the report The business world’s focus on machine learning (ML) may seem like an overnight development, but the buzz around this technology has been steadily growing since the early days of big data. ML is beginning to deliver on the potential created by big data and analytics by turning raw data into useful, predictive tools for business. Innovation-minded business leaders are embracing ML as “the next big thing” and have already crafted ML strategies and initiatives that promise real benefits and return on investment (ROI). The survey sought to reveal where organizations stand in terms of adopting ML strategies. Respondents included current ML strategists, representatives from companies planning to execute ML initiatives in the next months or years, and those with no ML plans for the foreseeable future. Several key themes emerged from an analysis of the survey results: ML is happening now. The majority of respondents (60 percent) have already implemented ML strategies, and nearly one-third considered themselves to be at a mature stage with their initiatives. ML provides marketplace advantage. According to respondents, a key benefit of ML is the ability to gain a competitive edge, and 26 percent of current ML implementers felt they had already achieved that goal. Organizations are investing in ML. Among current ML implementers, some 26 percent reported that more than 15 percent of their IT budgets was dedicated to ML initiatives. Early adopters are realizing ML’s biggest potential benefits. The top hoped for benefit among ML implementers and planners is the ability to extend data analysis efforts and increase data insights. Some 45 percent of respondents report success in meeting that goal. In addition, more than half of both early-stage and mature-stage users say their ML efforts have resulted in demonstrable return on investment (ROI). ML implementers are pursuing a broad range of projects. The most common projects among current ML implementers are image recognition, classification, and tagging (47 percent); emotion/behavior analysis (47 percent); text classification and mining (47 percent); and natural language processing, or NLP (45 percent). The speed with which respondents are able to demonstrate ROI with their ML initiatives is also notable, which, as mentioned earlier, was the not the case with big data analytics. Within the early-stage group, more than half report they are beginning to see a demonstrable ROI, and within the mature-stage group, more than half had demonstrated ROI.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Internet Google’s search quality raters can now mark results as ‘offensive’ Google’s search quality raters can now mark results as ‘offensive’ By Ryan Whitwam on March 16, 2017 at 3:15 pm Comment Google uses machines to scan the web and return relevant results for your search queries. Humans don’t often get involved in that process, but there are some things machines still aren’t good at. For example, evaluating the “quality” of a source. That’s why Google has a small army of humans around the world checking search results for quality. Now, these “quality raters” have been given a new directive — to flag offensive and upsetting content in searches. It turns out machines aren’t great at figuring out what humans will find offensive. The existence of quality raters was first made public in 2013 when Google released the manual they use to flag search results. When provided with search data, raters can mark results using various criteria like spam, porn, or illegal. This helps Google adjust its algorithms to remove results and improve the links and Knowledge Graph data it shows to users. Individual flags aren’t used to change results. Google is constantly making changes to its algorithm, and any change the results in fewer flags is marked as positive. While Google has not commented on the addition of the offensive-upsetting flag, it’s probably related to the increase in overtly racist content that’s being juiced up specifically to appear in search results. That’s the dark side of search engine optimization. In one particularly troubling incident a few months ago, searches on Google for “did the Holocaust happen” were showing a link to the white supremacist forum Stormfront at the top. That article gave people tips on how to explain and promote Holocaust denial. That’s probably not the appropriate thing to show at the top of search results. The above scenario is the example used in Google’s new quality rating manual for the offensive/upsetting flag. The link to Stormfront is not flagged as porn, foreign language, or didn’t load. It is, however, flagged as offensive. The rationale given is that holocaust denial is linked to antisemitism, and is therefore offensive to many people. A different result on the Holocaust from the History Channel is not marked as offensive because it gives accurate, well-sourced information on the events. Even before the introduction of the offensive flag, results like this were often demoted for quality reasons. The website might be slow, running sketchy ads, or the content may simply have been poorly presented. The new flag gives Google’s quality raters a simple catch-all for content that needs to be kept out of the top slots.

Why did Google acquire Australian-born Kaggle? In acquiring Australian-born crowdsourcing platform, Google gains access to 600,000 data scientists in a notoriously talent-strapped market. Clint Boulton (ARN) 17 March, 2017 06:30 - - - - print email Distributors Arrow ECS ANZ Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Synnex XiT Distribution Comments Anthony Goldbloom - Founder and CEO, Kaggle If you're a company entrenched in an arms race for artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, you could do worse than tapping into a pool of thousands of data scientists to augment your digital products and services. That's the pole position Google holds after acquiring crowdsourcing platform Kaggle last week for an undisclosed sum. Set up by Anthony Goldbloom in his Sydney bedroom, some 600,000 professional data crunchers use Kaggle to build prediction models for such heady challenges as cancer detection and heart disease diagnoses. And experts say Kaggle could help Google facilitate broader adoption of AI technologies. "Data science and machine learning is now global and this is a validation of the idea that Google recognizes that most of the smartest people in the world work for somebody else," Neil Jacobstein, who chairs the artificial intelligence and robotics track at Singularity University, told CIO.com. "This is potentially a very positive move, I think, that could make everybody more competitive." Kaggle's team will be integrated with Google's other AI assets, such as its developer library for TensorFlow, its open source machine learning software, said Fei-Fei Li, chief scientist of artificial intelligence and machine learning at Google Cloud, at the company's Google Cloud Next event last week. Computing systems have become exponentially more powerful over the past decade, enabling companies to collect vast amounts of data. Despite advances in analytics software intended to sift through such data, companies require people who can identify and glean insights from the data and turn it into actionable information that provides a competitive advantage. Accordingly, data scientists, those individuals who can leverage predictive models and machine learning algorithms to arrive at those answers, are highly coveted and in short supply. Democratising machine learning Fortunately for Google rivals and others looking to tap Kaggle's talent base, the community will remain open to all data scientists, companies and technologies, Kaggle CEO Anthony Goldbloom said in a blog post announcing the deal. This strategy is in line with Google's plans to democratize AI for the world by “lowering the barriers of entry, and making it available to the largest possible community of developers, users and enterprises," Google's Li said. Read more ​Why Larry Ellison’s continued criticism of AWS is tech’s biggest case of fake news If Google’s openness pledge holds, the acquisition could help further democratize AI for a world that has yet to leverage such technologies to any appreciable effect, according to Singularity University’s Jacobstein. He expects Google will try to foster a closer relationship with the community, helping to host the competitions and providing technology, including scalable infrastructure and the ability to store and query large data sets. Jacobstein is optimistic Google will keep its promise, noting that Google tends to act as a "responsible and enlightened player in the AI community," open-sourcing such key technologies as the TensorFlow machine learning library. Fei-Fei Li - Chief Scientist of Artificial Intelligence AI and Machine Learning, Google Cloud And DeepMind, the renowned AI company Google acquired in 2014, open sourced its flagship platform, DeepMind Lab, a 3D game platform tailored for AI research, last year. Whether Google can harness these technologies to make the world a better place, a goal shared by Facebook, Microsoft, Baidu and other tech giants, remains an open question. Read more ​Change ahead with five Aussie channel chief roles up for grabs "The real challenge is deploying AI in everyday human affairs in a way that allows us to augment our intelligence and manage our planet intelligently," Jacobstein said. “We have a huge opportunity to deploy better decision-making capabilities across the board and we are underutilizing those tools." Necessary progression of AI For Google, acquiring Kaggle is part of a necessary progression for AI technologies, including natural language processing, predictive analytics and machine learning tools intended to achieve breakthroughs, said Forrester Research analyst Brian Hopkins. "Google's acquisition of Kaggle essentially enables that innovation to be exponential because instead of saying there is one set of people at Microsoft or Facebook that can do this, Google can say that we are going to crowdsource this and create a set of emerging technology innovation," Hopkins said. "Being able to crowdsource and bring the best minds in and incentivize them to do that work is the way it has to happen. There is no other way it can happen. I'm pretty sure Google sees that." Read more 4 ways Google Cloud will bring AI, machine learning to the enterprise However, Hopkins said it remains to be seen whether Google can effectively commercialise anything from its AI assets. Its so-called moonshots, from self-driving cars to internet-enabling balloons, have yet to pan out. "Google is positioned to potentially repeat what they did [for search and AdWords] in the AI space because it is a big area for them, but they have competition," Hopkins said. "They need to find the commercialisation a-ha of how they're going to turn AI into something profitable just like they [turned] search into profitability," Hopkins said. The reality is that most enterprises haven't figured out quite what to do with machine learning and associated AI tools yet, let alone how such technologies can give them a competitive edge. Most organisations are only piloting AI and machine learning tools, including virtual assistants and robo-advisors, said Gartner analyst Whit Andrews, who tracks machine learning and AI technologies. Andrews said that a poll of 923 corporate employees with a title of vice president or higher revealed that 76 percent planned to try some form of AI or machine learning over the next 12 months.

With the change, content with racial slurs could now get flagged under a new category called “upsetting-offensive.” So could content that promotes hate or violence against a specific group of people based on gender, race or other criteria. While flagging something doesn’t directly affect the search results themselves, it’s used to tweak the company’s software so that better content ranks higher. This approach might, for instance, push down content that is inaccurate or has other questionable attributes, thereby giving prominence to trustworthy sources. The review teams — comprised of contractors known as quality raters — already comb through websites and other content to flag questionable items such as pornography. Google added “upsetting-offensive” in its latest guidelines for quality raters. Google declined to comment on the changes, which were reported in the blog Search Engine Land and elsewhere. The guidelines, which run 160 pages, are an interesting look into how Google ranks the quality of its search results. For instance, it gives examples of “high-quality” pages, such as the home page of a newspaper that has “won seven Pulitzer Prize awards,” and “low-quality” pages, such as an article that includes “many grammar and punctuation errors.” The guidelines cite an example of “Holocaust history” as a search query. A resulting website listing “Top 10 reasons why the holocaust didn’t happen” would get flagged. The new “upsetting-offensive” flag instructs quality raters to “flag to all Web results that contain upsetting or offensive content from the perspective of users in your locale, even if the result satisfies the user intent.” So even if the results are what the person searched for, such as white supremacist websites, they could still get flagged. But it doesn’t mean the results won’t show up at all when someone searches for them. Barbara Ortutay is an Associated Press writer.

Today, users have observed that during the ‘My Day’ feature on both phones and Google Home an ad for a new Disney movie plays. The specific ad that users began hearing this morning is for the Beauty and the Beast remake. It plays right after Google Home finishes with weather, commute, reminders, and calendar events, but before the long news reports and podcasts. Starting off with “By the way,” the Home notes that the movie is opening today and goes into some detail about how the remake differs from the original. Google Assistant’s default robotic voice is used to read the message with background music and sound effects also playing. Notably, the background tune is identical to a previous added message about Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January. This ad ends with Google telling users that they can ask “for more movie fun” which brings up the Assistant’s built-in trivia game. As a successor to Google Now, the continued addition of ads is notable. In the past, the company has not placed ads in the Now stream of cards. This change could possibly signal a new way for Google to serve ads to users. At the moment, there does not appear to be a place for users to opt-out of ads in settings. While the Feed, as it is now officially refered to, does show cards for previously searched for movies, the ad during My Day does not appear to be limited to those users. Update: In a statement, Google disagrees with the categorization of today’s clip as an ad: “This isn’t an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales.” In a lengthier, second statement, Google reaffirms that it wasn’t an ad, but adds that it was an experiment to “surface unique content for users.” Coincidentally, using ‘My Day’ on my Pixel seems to no longer play the ‘Beauty and the Beast’ portion, as Google notes that they could “have done better in this case.” “This wasn’t intended to be an ad. What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case.” New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO — brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017   Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

By Ryan Grenoble 420 Forget the law-evading software, the #DeleteUber protests and even the video of CEO Travis Kalanick chewing out an employee ― er, that is, an independent contractor. Ultimately, Uber might be undone by the inbox. On Dec. 13, an employee at Waymo, a self-driving startup founded by Google, was accidentally copied on an email from one of its vendors. Where was the email supposed to go? Why, to Uber ― or, more specifically, to Uber’s newly acquired startup Otto. Included in the email were schematics for a circuit board, one that looked remarkably similar to a board designed at considerable expense by Waymo. Without that circuit board and the “LiDAR” (laser-based surveying) technology it made possible, neither Otto nor Waymo would be going on a self-driving jaunt any time soon. “The email, which a Waymo employee was copied on, was titled OTTO FILES and its recipients included an email alias indicating that the thread was a discussion among members of the vendor’s ‘Uber’ team,” lawyers representing Waymo wrote in a complaint filed in court late last month. The email, which a Waymo employee was copied on, was titled OTTO FILES and its recipients included an email alias indicating that the thread was a discussion among members of the vendor’s “Uber” team. From the legal complaint filed by Waymo's lawyers “Attached to the email was a machine drawing of what purported to be an Otto circuit board... that bore a striking resemblance to ― and shared several unique characteristics with ― Waymo’s highly confidential current-generation LiDAR circuit board, the design of which had been downloaded by Mr. Levandowski before his resignation.” “Mr. Levandowski” is Anthony Levandowski, a former Waymo engineer now at the center of a brewing showdown between Google and Uber. Levandowski abruptly resigned from Waymo in January 2016, then founded Otto and sold it to Uber for $680 million that summer. (You can read a complete, surprisingly riveting timeline of the saga here, via the New Zealand tech blogger Daniel Compton.) The vendor’s misaddressed email has spurred an investigation by Waymo into Levandowski’s activities. Waymo declined to speak about the email or the ensuing investigation, instead directing The Huffington Post to a company blog post on the matter: We found that six weeks before his resignation this former employee, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files for Waymo’s various hardware systems, including designs of Waymo’s LiDAR and circuit board. To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Mr. Levandowski searched for and installed specialized software onto his company-issued laptop. Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation. Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr. Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints. Beyond Mr. Levandowki’s actions, we discovered that other former Waymo employees, now at Otto and Uber, downloaded additional highly confidential information pertaining to our custom-built LiDAR including supplier lists, manufacturing details and statements of work with highly technical information. Adding to the intrigue, a former Waymo colleague of Levandowski’s testified last Friday that Levandowski had discussed “replicating” the LiDAR technology at a new company, and that an Uber executive had approached him about “buying the team responsible for the LiDAR we were developing at Google.” ANGELO MERENDINO/AFP via Getty Images Anthony Levandowski, Otto co-founder and VP of engineering at Uber, speaks to members of the press during the launch of the pilot model of the Uber self-driving car on Sept. 13, 2016, in Pittsburgh. Levandowski was more than a mid-level engineer at Waymo. In many respects, he’s responsible for Google’s entire self-driving project. In 2008, Levandowski cobbled together a self-driving Toyota Prius in his spare time. He went on to wow Google with a demonstration in which the Prius autonomously delivered a pizza, successfully navigating the streets of downtown San Francisco using an early version of LiDAR. “The technology for being able to improve your convenience and safety while on the freeway is just around the corner,” he told CNET at the time. “I want to be the one to provide that.” All of which is to say: Levandowski brought considerable knowledge to Uber, Waymo files or no. ANGELO MERENDINO/AFP via Getty Images The cameras on a pilot model of an Uber self-driving car are displayed at the Uber Advanced Technologies Center on Sept. 13, 2016, in Pittsburgh. Uber didn’t respond to a request for comment for this article, but in a late February interview with Forbes, Levandowski adamantly denied stealing any of Google’s technology. “We did not steal any Google [intellectual property],” he said. “Just want to make sure, super clear on that. We built everything from scratch and we have all of the logs to make that ― just to be super clear.” (It’s unclear what logs Levandowski is referring to. Last Friday, Google submitted testimony from a forensics security engineer analyzing the company’s own logs of Levandowski’s behavior, including the downloading of 9.7 gigabytes of data described above.) Uber has also dismissed the accusations as “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.” Indeed, Reuters notes that in May 2016, Uber acquired a little-known company by the name of Tyto Lidar LLC, which holds a LiDAR patent that could help the company rebut Waymo’s accusations. Last week, Google filed an injunction in California, asking the court to halt Uber’s self-driving program. A ruling in Waymo’s favor could deliver a devastating blow to Uber, setting it back several years in its development of autonomous technology, and hindering its ability to raise more money from a pool of undoubtedly increasingly uneasy investors. Should this turn into a protracted legal battle, it’s hard to think of a worse adversary for Uber than one of the world’s richest and most powerful companies.  The case is scheduled for a hearing April 27.

Apparently, an owner of a Google Home asked the standard, “OK Google, what’s my day like?,” which was met with the current weather and traffic conditions. All that is normal. However, at the end of that personalized snippet of info, what appears to be an audio advertisement for the new Beauty and the Beast movie began playing, and of course, people on the internet are upset.  You can view what exactly happens below in the video, but to sum it up, Google Home goes on to say, “By the way, Beauty and The Beast opens in theaters today. In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer if you ask me.” Then, Google Home states you can ask followup questions pertaining to Belle. Cool, yeah, no thanks. In a statement to The Verge, Google clarifies that in its view, this isn’t an ad. “This isn’t an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales.” Now, some may label that as an ad, while others (only Google) say it is not. While it’s not the worst thing ever, and we don’t know if Disney actually paid for this audio spot on Google Home, it has rubbed a few Google Home owners the wrong way. I’ll let you be the judge if this is a no-no by Google or people need to lighten up. New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO — brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 Via: reddit Post navigation Previous StoryWomp Womp: No Google Assistant for Android Tablets Next StoryMontblanc Intros $890 Android Wear Watch With No GPS, No NFC and No LTE Chad “This isn’t an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to *be our guest* and share their tales.” gag Patel Nisha That’s hilarious..! -Alexa Gaylesventers Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Armorthane How many people pay for Sirius XM and PAY to listen to commercials or some DJ spout whatever dribble they want to offer. I only have Sirius because it’s free in my new truck for a while, but if I’m going to pay for Music or for an assistant like Google Home then I sure as hell DON’T plan on listening to ads, commercials or whatever you want to call them. Not like Amazon needs any help with selling their Echo, but if Google did continue the ads, Echo’s sales would only go up! Andy is this pic at your house kellen? cgalyon Heh heh, I appreciate this: “…invites our partners to be our guest…” Very clever, Google Steve Hirjak Even more offensive that they claim it’s not an ad! How much DID Disney pay that they continued on with the ad in their defense?! KleenDroid There are so many sites I no longer go to because of ads. If it were not for ad blockers the list might include some of my most favorite 🙂 This article just eliminated a Google Home from my wish list if this isn’t a one time thing. If I had recently purchased it I would return it the moment I heard this. Ads in these devices or my Google Assistant would be deal breakers for me. NexusMan I agree that I stop going to sites too because of ads. This, however, which has already been removed by the way, was a noon issue for me. Whereas ads on sites are intrusive and slow down your browsing and often times can’t be easily removed, with this I can literally just say STOP. trevorsalienarms Upset? Why would anyone be surprised by this? This is literally what google does, sell advertising. Steve Hirjak So you’ll be fine when you get a phone call on your Android phone and find that it’s a Disney ad when you answer? trevorsalienarms Nope. Just wouldn’t be surprised. NexusMan Nowhere near the same thing. A closer comparison, however, is me swiping to the right on my phone and Google telling me a particular movie opens today, a TV show is on tonight or an actor is on a talk show today….All of which have happened, and yes, I’m fine with it. calvin35 Nope. Not cool. Daistaar Maybe he should upgrade to Google Home Red. NexusMan Love it. NexusMan Or he should have paid attention and not bought the Google Home marked “with Special Offers.” Fitzgerald42 Comment of the thread. pappy53 A “children’s movie” with gay scenes. WTH is this world coming to? Fitzgerald42 It’s a story about a girl falling in love with a beast. Smh pappy53 So you haven’t read the news about this version? People are calling for a boycott. Sporttster My wife and kids were looking forward to seeing it until the gay nonsense was included. Now they’re not. It’s ridiculous they included that in the movie…but that’s our society today…. NexusMan Do you even know what the “gay nonsense” is? Sporttster Don’t believe anyone is attempting to push beastiality on society……yet…. Sporttster Agreed. Has no place whatsoever being in a childrens movie. dtm4 Yeah, because it’s such a tragedy for children to realize that gay people are a normal part of society and should be treated just like anyone else. pappy53 It is not normal by any stretch of the imagination. Children should not be subjected to media that suggests that being gay is normal. Jackal Frost This just made the 130 dollar smart speaker an even harder sell for me. I like Assistant, and would like to have it more readily accessible, but, I don’t want ads. lamenting Ironically, I tried out the “tell me about my day” in Google Assistant on my 6P today and got the same thing. NexusMan Uh oh. That means everyone on this site has to switch to iOS! KleenDroid Honestly it would cause me to switch to Bixby shortly. And I thought I wouldn’t but this nonsense will force me to. TechGirl90 This is definitely not ok, hopefully Google rectify this issue immediately, but until then, I’ll just be ok purchasing the LG G6 Unlocked and they can keep Google Home. MI95SHO You can buy the G6 and send me the Google Home 😛 Jonathan Rogers If it had stopped after “Disney’s beauty and the beast hits theaters today.” Then maybe asked “are you interested in movie times in your area?” I wouldn’t be half as outraged. That would felt more like engagement rather than an ad. But no, it violated my ears with Whimsical music. At that point it became an ad. MI95SHO Better yet. It took the time to give you spoilers to the movie while it was at it. Hoffman That is advertising, and it is not unusual. trixnkix637 Geez. Not everything requires outrage. It’s a suggestion. If it applies to you, then cool. If not, then why even bother paying attention to it? Bigger things to worry about folks. WiscoNative It’s a “suggestion” as much as the commercials on TV are “suggestions.” If you bought the device thinking it wouldn’t have ads, it’s fair to be upset by the ads. Let this one go and eventually you’ll be seeing the ads more often, like “Ok Google, what’s the weather today?” “This weather answer brought to you by Pepsi. Pepsi, enjoy one today…in the rain.” trixnkix637 Know what I do when a commercial is on I don’t care about or doesn’t pertain me? Change the channel, don’t listen, or do something else until it’s over. I don’t railroad the FCC or CBS because I’m upset they ran a Maybelline ad after the intro of Big Bang Theory. It’s really not that big of a deal. You bought an intuitive consumer product from an ad revenue driven company. There shouldn’t be any surprises. Now if it was listening in on your conversations and giving you ads based on what it overheard you said, then THAT is a problem. But even if it learns from you talking to it like Google Now & Assistant do, how is that an issue? MI95SHO Can’t really change the channel or tune out when the whole reason you asked Google a question is to listen for the response of your inquiry. trixnkix637 It comes after the response you were waiting for. You could totally tune out after. blackbird2150 Today it does. What about tomorrow? Could be in the middle or the beginning. Youtube does all 3. trixnkix637 Hey if you haven’t yet accepted the fact that Google is SkyNet/The Matrix in it’s infancy, I don’t know what to tell you. NexusMan Then, we’ll talk about tomorrow when tomorrow comes. Today we’re talking about today. WiscoNative It comes after 3/4 of the response, and BEFORE the news portion of the daily briefing starts. That’s not “after the response you were waiting for.” trixnkix637 Man that 18 seconds of my life was completely wasted. You’re absolutely right. This is a travesty of epic privacy proportions. Whatever will I do with that whole 18 seconds of life I can never get back because I was too busy not paying attention to something I didn’t care about. For Christ’s sake, it even cues you to let you know to start paying attention again. The lolz at you being this upset. NexusMan You can say, “OK Google. Stop.” Which is even more simple than when you said “OK Google, tell me about my day.” And the fact that they put this “ad” at the very end of all the information about your day, makes it even that more of a non issue to tell it to stop, as you won’t be missing any information you want. NexusMan All very true. WiscoNative It’s a problem because I paid the $129 for the device and service without Google mentioning ads. Their pitch, their arguments for buying the device, included no mention of ads. It’s different from TV, where you KNOW you’re going to get ads because that is understood when you agree to a price. trixnkix637 They didn’t say they were going to include ads and they didn’t say they weren’t. You bought the product not the functionality. Google reserves the right to do what they want with the software. Again, it boils down to the fact that you’re upset about a ad revenue driven company giving you ads in their products. Which by the way, all their products do in some form or another. WiscoNative “They didn’t say they were going to include ads and they didn’t say they weren’t. ” — This is a terrible argument to make. “Well, they didn’t say they WOULDN’T do this, so oh well.” My auto loan doesn’t specify that my bank won’t have me murdered, but if they did, I think some people might be pretty upset. “you’re upset about a ad revenue driven company giving you ads in their products” — Yes, because I paid money for the product already with the understanding that it would simply provide the service I wanted. I don’t care what their main revenue is from, it’s not how they advertised this specific device. trixnkix637 Sigh. You bought the HARDWARE. It obviously performs directly as advertised. You have no ownership to the software and how they choose to use it. You’re right, your auto loan didn’t advertise they’d have you murdered. They also didn’t advertise that they can change your APR or the amount that goes to principal or the fact that they can repossess it with or without prior notification to you for any reason they feel. Why is that ok? Because you paid for a financial service. Not the car. Not yet anyway. See how that works? Not caring about where they get their main revenue from is kind of what got you in this mess. I imagine you probably care alot more now. WiscoNative “They also didn’t advertise that they can change your APR or the amount that goes to principal or the fact that they can repossess it with or without prior notification to you for any reason they feel. Why is that ok? Because you paid for a financial service. Not the car. Not yet anyway.” — Yeah, they did. That made that very clear actually. When I bought the hardware, I was agreeing with Google that I would give them $129 for the hardware AND the service. Their including ads just betrays the users who purchased the device with the understanding that the cost would include the service as advertised – without more ads. There’s no good excuse for them suddenly including them and using these early adopters for even more money. trixnkix637 Lol putting it in a contract for you to read isn’t the same thing and you know that haha. Those are the last things they’re gonna outright tell you. But alas, you bought it. They have their money. And it’s all good and legal. You can be irrationally upset all you want. You don’t have justification to stand on. Just a soapbox of buyers regret. Realize R&D isn’t cheap and that ad revenue they get goes to making more products for you to use. “When I bought the hardware, I was agreeing with Google that I would give them $129 for the hardware AND the service.” – that’s your fault for assuming the service was included. Obviously they didn’t agree to those terms. It’s not like you’re paying Google a monthly fee. Just enjoy Beauty and the Beast and relax man. Bigger things going on in the world. Or put it on Craigslist and really stand for something other than arguing with me on DL. WiscoNative Your attempts to justify a company betraying their early adopter base seem sadly misguided. I’m going to see the movie this weekend and I’m sure I’ll love it, but I’m not going to let Google creep more and more ads into my services after I agree to pay them for such services WITHOUT ads. They’re simply taking advantage of users and it’s not ok. trixnkix637 TL:DR. I’ve fed this troll monster enough. Either sell your Home or write a stern letter to Google. Better yet try a class action lawsuit if you’re that up in arms. Again that’s your fault for buying the product of an ad revenue company. Quit belly aching about it. Oh the lolz. NexusMan Apparently their only taking advantage of readers who don’t read. NexusMan Well put. NexusMan Have you ever read Google’s Terms of Service? Seems like you haven’t.

FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS.

If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service. ….So will you and the other people whining on this board please stop already, with your claims that Google somehow promised you an “ad free” device in exchange for your $129. Because that’s not true. Period. Writing a story of a non existent agreement you had with Google when you bought Google, doesn’t make said story true. What’s the actual fact is what Google clearly spells out in their TOS. And they even go on to say that if they didn’t have it in their TOS at the time, they still reserve the right to modify those terms! NexusMan Lol, you’re comparing a Beauty & the Beast announcement that the listener’s child was very excited to hear to a multi billion dollar company committing the crime of murdering someone….talk about “a terrible argument.” NexusMan Exaclty. Not to mention the fact that Google’s Terms of Service have ALWAYS had language pertaining to ads. NexusMan Their Terms Of Service clearly states: WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”. NexusMan You bought it “thinking it wouldn’t have ads?” You and I were thinking 2 very different things when I bought it. I never THOUGHT about ads…whether it did or didn’t have them… when I bought it. NexusMan Agreed. needa Can any and everyone recreate this to get the ad? I ask because I wonder if maybe they ‘showed interest’ in the movie, or generally buy movie tickets online, previously. Therefore they got the ad. Kinda like how Now does when you search for couches today, and get Now cards on couches a day or two later. If it is assistant giving me info/ad on something that I have shown interest in, I am OK with it. As this is what assistant is supposed to do. If I am a movie goer… why would I not want Google to let me know when movies are coming out. But if it is just an ad going around to everyone, then Home isn’t a product that I want in my house. PerhapsNever I can recreate it and I have no interest in the movie (haven’t searched for it, viewed articles on it, nothing). needa Ouch. That really sucks then. PerhapsNever Meh, I rarely use my day anyhow (my wife and I are on a shared account, so it doesn’t really do much for us). But, if they do start putting adverts into other things (“Hey Google, turn on the kitchen lights.” “Ok, by the way, do you want to hear about some great deals from [local restaurant]?”), I’d be a bit peeved. At least they should provide an option to opt-out of said adverts. trixnkix637 Wait.. has your wife ever searched or clicked on anything Beauty and Beast related? A shared account would explain why you get the ad. PerhapsNever Nope. Neither of us have. I thought about that too. NexusMan If you don’t like it, say ” OK Google. Stop.” Get over it. I’d bet most of the people complaining don’t even own the device. WiscoNative If you don’t like it…voice your complaints so Google knows that you don’t like it. People paid for a device thinking it wouldn’t have ads, they shouldn’t just “get over it” when Google changes the terms of the agreement. SchwannyT So you think that your $129 paid for 14 years of voice recognition, intelligent searching, natural language detection and AI development? You keep saying you “paid” for this device, yet you can’t find a comparable wifi speaker that is even close to that price range let alone one with any kind of voice assistance. What you paid for is a cheap portal to their free service. WiscoNative $129 ain’t cheap for the two microphones and average speaker it comes with, so I think the vast majority of the price actually DOES go towards their services. And as technology and AI improve, and back-end servers and processing power become cheaper for them, my money should go plenty far towards an ad-free assistant. SchwannyT You paid for 2 hours of a single Google programmers day. #RealityisExpensive#IsitCheaperWhereYouLive blackbird2150 one that doesn’t say “will play ads from time to time based on your interest.” You know, the whole let the customer know what you’re buying thing? amazon does it for the ad and ad-free versions of hardware. It’s also interesting to note that this didn’t happen from day 1. They waited, what, 4-5 months? NexusMan Ok, so keep complaining so for the next version, like Amazon, they’ll make you pay $20 extra so you’re not inconvenienced with a Beauty and the Beast ad at the end of a “my day” query on opening night of the movie. I’ll ignore it, and keep that $20 in my pocket. blackbird2150 Perfect. You’ll take the ads and I’ll pay the $20. See how we’re both satisfied with choice? Problem is not only did we not have the choice here, we didn’t even know it would be an issue before buying the device. NexusMan It’s NOT an issue. You never even knew it happened until you read about it, and it already isn’t happening anymore. See how that’s NOT an issue? Did you know that Home would display Christmas lights if you told it to play a Christmas song before you bought it? Or that it would display Hanukkah colors? Did they put that on the box? Oh, no!!! Everyone who’s an atheist or who doesn’t celebrate Christmas or who isn’t Jewish who bought a Google Home should be outraged!!! They didn’t tell you they’d do that before you spent $129!!! Write your Congressmen! Return your Google Homes! Boycott Google! Make America Great Again!!! NexusMan Correction: YOU didn’t know. I’m familiar with Google’s Terms of Service. NexusMan What TOA are Google changing? NexusMan Terms were never changed. You just didn’t read them. WiscoNative I don’t really care about the details of the EULA here, because the premise of the device didn’t include listening to ads. Maybe they didn’t violate their terms, but they basically tricked people here. It’s not good for them. NexusMan The fact that you don’t care about the TOS is precisely why you incorrectly feel tricked. Lol. Yea, because when I swipe to the right on my Google phone I never see daily suggestions like “This movie opens tonight,” or “This TV show is on today,” or “This album is released today,” yea that NEVER happens, so why would any reasonably intelligent person think that may ever appear on Google Home which also uses Google Assistant. (sarcasm) Ryan Not overreacting. Ads are fine for something that is free, not for something you pay for. NexusMan Tell that to Amazon. Worked for them. Ryan Amazon has opt-in ads, like the Kindle with a discount. NexusMan I’m aware. The opt in ad Kindle is still something you pay for. It’s not free. You said ads are only good for something that’s free, not something you pay for. Ryan Ok dude, argue in circles . You get a STEEP discount on a kindle for the home screen ads and its disclosed before. If you want to use that as an excuse that anyone can show ads at anytime then whatever. NexusMan Don’t misinterpret your misunderstanding of my comment as me arguing in circles. I simply pointed out that you said only free should have ads, and I pointed out that the Kindle with Special Offers is not free, so you should tell that to Amazon. Also $15-$20 is not a STEEP discount. Ryan Ok dude, masturbate to semantics all you want. NexusMan Whatever. You don’t get it. Move on. Fitzgerald42 Home is a service, the device is just the gateway. Ryan And its completely pointless without the service. It literally does nothing without the service. So are you saying Google has a right to wake my phone and start pushing ads because Android is just the gateway? Fitzgerald42 Yep Cogito Oh cool, buy a G6, get a free Google Hom– Welp. Nevermind. Akashshr Samsung..nice try Lman146 Wow, I’ve been mildly interested in a Google Home but will 100% not be buying one if this is the direction they are going. Audio ads are the worst. Shouldn’t be serving ads on a $129 device. NexusMan There are far better reasons not to buy a Google Home than this. Francisco Peña Ok Google, Will LeFou take it up the poop chute in the movie? Francisco Peña Sorry, that is an ad… I’d be pissed if I hear an ad, because while B&tB is benign, who’s to say the next movie has worse info? Ryan Cook Wow. Like my home, but don’t want Audio ads. It’s supposed to be a tool to quick and efficient information – I’ll pause on additional units until this shakes out and see what Amazon does with Echo. I might have made a mistake, but at least only have one. krubby Am I upset or bent out of shape about it? NO. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t an Ad. Give me a break. Maybe the question to Google should be “Were you paid any amount of money to include this on the end of the response”. If NO, then I guess it is just out of the goodness of their heart they are informing us of this. If Yes, then, well…. tnt So Google’s official response to this is to try and be “cute” and make light of it I guess? Zee12399 I feel like the whole story isn’t being told. Their twitter feed continually is telling people that they “are looking into this”… What is being looked into? WiscoNative That’s corporate speak for “We don’t want to admit that we screwed up, so we’re meeting with PR to discuss how best to play this off.” Lman146 Ding ding ding… we have a winner. d-rock Google forgot that free = ads. People shouldn’t have to pay for ads..silly Google. NexusMan Because that television you have sitting in your living room doesn’t display ads. bhayes444 Mine doesn’t, unless I’m specifically using it in a way I expect ads. That is what is happening here. If I was casting my screen to my TV I would not expect to see an ad after doing that. However, if I’m watching OTA TV I would definitely expect ads. People don’t want/expect ads after having google tell them their day. Now if google home were to be asked about events going on… that’s a different story. trixnkix637 That event is happening on the day he’s asking about his day though. bhayes444 I was implying that if the person were to literally ask Google “what events are happening near me?” then the Beauty and the Beast advert is almost asked for by the consumer. trixnkix637 We’re just arguing semantics at that point. It’s pretty much the same question. bhayes444 Not really. If the person has no interest in the movie, then including it in an overview of their day offers little value. It is just an advertisement to get them thinking about it so maybe they’ll go. I would take back my comment if Google actually had used an algorithm to predict whether certain people actually would like this movie and only pushed this message to them, as that is something more impressive and useful. trixnkix637 Agree to disagree. NexusMan Google is not calling that an ad. Just as you seem to not be calling an ad, a segment in a television show or movie that you cast to your screen, where the actors or personalities use a deliberately placed product, or talk about the benefits of a particular product or business. Or walk by a billboard, for example, of a business or movie. bhayes444 I’m not calling those ads because this was not a discussion about covert advertising, which product placement and billboards in shows/movie pretty much are. This is a conversation about overt advertisement of a movie, appearing out of the blue, when someone was not doing an activity where an ad would normally be placed. NexusMan How is Google Home, a smart Assistant speaker that when asked to tell you about the day, mentions in the middle of it, hey did you know Beauty and the Beast opens today…Just as it would do on your smartphone, OVERT advertising? Google isn’t even saying it’s it’s an ad. Sounds pretty covert to me. bhayes444 It is quite clearly an ad that doesn’t hide the fact it is. Why wouldn’t it mention any other new event or movie opening up until this point then? The only way it is remotely acceptable is if it is pulling some information that this particular person might like to see this movie, thereby offering a helpful reminder to them that they may want to go and see it. Also, why would an assistant give you random information that doesn’t really improve the cohesiveness of your day or schedule, but only serves to complicate it by trying to add the suggestion of going to see a movie in there, sound like a crappy personal assistant. Unless that assistant is tasked with helping you spend money. NexusMan Actually, that statement is incorrect. Google Home has periodically thrown “random” information in that same spot relevant to that particular day. Most recent I can remember was on Valentine’s Day it said to me, hey did you know today is Valentine’s day, and went on to say a little about the history of the day. bhayes444 I don’t know which statement you’re referring to. Since most of what I said is subjective, it can be considered neither correct nor incorrect. The snippet about Valentine’s Day is fine as it is not pushing a product or service. The movie mention would be akin to google home telling you: “Also, today is Valentine’s Day. Why not sweeten up your evening with a treat from the Cheesecake Factory.” NexusMan If “most” of what you said was subjective, then one would assume I was referring to the things you said that were not subjective​. Additionally, my statement was very clear, so I’m not sure why you don’t know what I was referring to. Regardless, here’s a breakdown for you: “Why wouldn’t it mention any other new event or movie opening up until this point then?” Again, that’s not true, as I previously stated. Your cheesecake factory analogy is not good as Home did not tell you to go see the movie. It did not say Why not sweeten up your night by checking out Beauty and the Beast. The movie opened that day so it was relevant on that day, and it did not mention it before or after that day, And again, Home has regularly and randomly mentioned things from a specific day on that day. That same day, while watching a morning news program, 1 of the hosts during casual banter told the other, That new Beauty and the Beast movie opens today, I’m gonna take my niece. Should be fun. Was that an ad? No. bhayes444 We could argue over minutia forever. The real issue at hand here is whether this extra information was something useful and wanted by everybody who uses the service. Obviously you and I stand on opposite sides of this issue. I feel like there needs to be a way to customize what information it gives you in the future and even giving you the option to turn it off. In regards to the news anchor’s comment, yes that can be considered an advertisement or endorsement for the movie. It’s not official, but it is still a way to promote the movie, thereby making it an advertisement. There are lots of things around us that advertise to us, it’s all just a matter of how obvious it is. d-rock Ads only display on my TV by my choice. I could choose to never have an ad on my TV. Keep on fanboi. I see you trolling people who don’t like this. trixnkix637 That means not buying the TV. Which you could’ve done with the Home. So what exactly is your point here? There’s ads everywhere. Whether you want them, control them, or otherwise. NexusMan ok. You can also chose to not have that Beauty and the Beast announcement on your Home. Point? Michael Shorey my tv doesn’t display ads cause i don’t pay for cable. i have ad free hulu and netflix. NexusMan And I never asked my Google Home to tell me about my day and had it tell me about Beauty and the Beast. So my Google Home doesn’t have ads either. MJ I am even more glad now I ended up returning mine… NexusMan Off topic, but why did you end up returning it? MJ Limited functionality and seemed more like a toy to me (I know this has improved since than). I was also concerned about even more data about me going to Google. NexusMan I ask because I’ve actually found the responsiveness of my devices has diminished rather than improved. OligarchyAmbulance Yeah, I’m not ok with that, and I definitely wouldn’t have bought two of them had I known they were going to turn into Windows 10 devices that give me ads on the product I already purchased. Good_Ole_Pinocchio That’s pretty ridiculous. Did I ask you about this silly movie? No? Then it’s an AD… Google. Tyler Durden True I’m sick of seeing Logan everywhere. #medicore #overrated #needsomethingspicey J. Gilbertson Know where I can find some chimichangas? Lucky Armpit Yeah I’d be irked if that was me. alarson83 yeah… i find the assertion its not an ad more offensive than having ads themselves. Tiffany j’adore Stop lying.. Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, now I know that I’ll never be getting one. WiscoNative Google’s @madebygoogle twitter account right now is basically just replies to owners of the device who are complaining about this, and I’m among them. I understand ads in a free service like Gmail, but on a device I’ve paid $129 for, this is unacceptable. Dnice I wonder if they’re backing off because @madebygoogle is now asking people to let them know if they here anymore ads. WiscoNative I think they are. blackbird2150 Certainly hope so. I was pretty peeved when I heard about this. People that just say “it’s google you should expect ads” are being dumb. I paid for a device that did not say there would be ads. Now later they try to add ads. Unacceptable. At least Amazon tells you up front about the fact that it’s an ad based device and you can pay to remove ads – so you know what you’re getting into and can make a choice either way. My choice would have easily been: don’t buy 2 google homes. AliceThomas111 <-I was paid 104 thousand bucks in last twelve months by doing an online job a­­n­­d I was able to do it by wor­king in my own time f­­o­­r 3+ hrs /daily.

Your one time purchase price is for the hardware; it does cost money to run and maintain the service as well. Common sense should tell you ads should be expected,-especially since Google is an advertising company in real life. WiscoNative I did pay full price for my phone up front, and there aren’t ads on it. There may be for some apps that I downloaded, but I agreed to those when I purchased those apps. In this case, common sense should tell me that I should expect the device as advertised. And it did not advertise that it would come with ads. NexusMan Where did it advertise that it wouldn’t?

Serviceproviderssuck I pay for cable TV service yet I see ads all the time… on a TV I paid for…While renting a box from the cable company… Jonathan Rogers Yes, but you expect it on a TV. You don’t expect your assistant to spout off ads. An assistant works for you, not the other way around. You’re in charge. NexusMan LOL. You do realize the assistant concept is relatively new…and the Google Home is a device that is only a few short months old. I don’t “expect,” anything from it, as it is a completely new device. What I anticipate happening, however, is Google adding, taking away, and experimenting with may different features and techniques to develop the platform into something it and it’s users find useful. trixnkix637 This man gets it. Steve Hirjak You seriously bought a device not expecting anything from it. Like a paperweight? Seriously? Fitzgerald42 Cable TV channels were never supposed to have commercials. That was one of the lures back in the late 70’s and early 80’s WiscoNative Yes, but you agreed to see those ads when you signed up for the service. People did not agree to these ads when they purchased a Google Home. Jeff718 I found the guy who must’ve read the EULA NexusMan I’m sorry. At what point exactly do you agree to see those ads? I don’t recall signing those documents. Jamie Frost it’s a stretch but “Our Services display some content that is not Google’s.

Fitzgerald42 Bingo. Why anyone is surprised is surprising. This is Google after all. Zee12399 But your TV isn’t the ad generator… the broadcasting groups are. Its entirely different. trevorsalienarms Look at the Pixel. 750 or 800 bucks, whatever it costs, for the privelege of helping Google get better at serving you targeted ads and building their natural language database via Assistant. As capable a device it may be, make no mistake about why these devices are being built. And I’m not saying it’s just Google. The end game is not building the best device to make your life easier, it’s vaccuming up as much information about you as you’ll knowingly (or unknowingly) allow. Pixel is far less about rolling out a subjectively better piece of consumer electronics than anyone else. It was about debuting Assistant. Same with Google Home. Who truly benefits more from an Echo or a Google Home or any of these kinds of devices? The consumer because we can ask the weather or tell it to play a song, or the manufacturers who capture all this big data? I’d argue all day long it’s the latter. Arkitech Folks will be all up in arms about it for a short while and then move on to something else pretty quick. tnt Unfortunately that’s probably the case… MJ I doubt it since this is an audio ad (extra annoying) that gets played during the normal operation of the device. My bet is Google backtracks on this, says it was a test/mistake, or gives an option to turn it off. inklenotrump It was right there on the box – This device will serve you ads – I’m not sure why people are surprised… Jeff718 They may have been something mentioned during all those “I accept” screens in initial setup NexusMan WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES WE MAY ADD OR REMOVE FUNCTIONALITIES OR FEATURES OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER GOOGLE NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES.

Almost purchased one and had it on my shopping list. I guess I’ll keep my money local with Echo. NexusMan Hardly would call this a backlash. Most people who even heard the Beauty announcement heard it on sites like these, and many people could care less. It is well within your right to stick to Echo. Just as many others, including myself, would stick with Google if/because we find the benefits far outweigh a “Releasing today movie notification” every once in a while.

About 10,000 independent contractors worldwide, which Google calls Quality Raters, will flag upsetting or offensive content to ensure that these types of search terms do not appear. The company wants to teach its algorithms to more effectively spot the offensive and factually incorrect information in an effort to uphold an agreement the search company made earlier this year. The raters rate pages based on guidelines that appear in the top results as to the quality of the answers. The searches come from a list of real searches that Google identifies. The data from the raters is used to improve Google search algorithms, and in time the hope is that data will have an impact on low quality pages. The guidelines have a new section that explains what Google calls an Upsetting-Offensive Flag and how to assign the flag to that type of content. The guidelines define the content that promotes hate or violence against a group of people based on criteria such as race or ethnicity, religion, gender, nationality or citizenship, disability, age, sexual orientation, or veteran status. Content that will be flagged includes any type of content with racial slurs or extremely offensive terminology, or graphic violence, including animal cruelty or child abuse. It also bans content about explicit how­-to information about harmful activities such as murder or human trafficking. Quality raters do not have the ability to change how search results are ranked. The feedback will be used by Google's engineering team and machine learning technology to improve search results. algorithms, content issues, data, england, europe, google, search, youtube Comment Next story loading More from Search Marketing Daily Google Reviews Ad Policies To Improve Brand Safety UK Withdraws Ads From Google, YouTube: Cites Hate Speech Pinterest Goes After Visual Search Market Share xAd Introduces Cost-Per-Visit In-Store Ad Pricing Model Google Tweaks Algorithm To Flag Offensive Content, Move Follows Criticism

By constantly growing the scale of their data center infrastructure, cloud giants are able to continue lowering prices of their services as they battle for share of the enterprise cloud market. At the Google Cloud Next conference earlier this month in San Francisco Google launched the latest attack in this battle, which at least for now has a good shot at being successful. In addition to the modest five-to-eight-percent price drop on cloud VMs (although at large enough scale it stops being modest), the company announced new so-called Committed Use Discounts, which can slash the cost of its cloud infrastructure services by up to 55 percent in exchange for a one-to-three-year commitment by the customer. Importantly, these new discounts for long-term users mean Google’s cloud may now be cheaper for those users than Amazon Web Services, the leader in the space, whose compute capacity accounts for 90 percent of the world’s processor cores running virtual machines for customers, also known as Infrastructure-as-a-Service. That’s according to Michael Warrilow, VP at the market research firm Gartner. Most of the remaining 10 percent of compute cores are in Microsoft’s cloud data centers, Warrilow said, with Google splitting whatever’s left with a few other players. “But it’s not going to be hard for [Google] to turn up,” he added. “The demand is there.” And the new discounts are likely to help Google turn up, unless of course AWS and Microsoft Azure don’t promptly respond with new price cuts and discounts of their own, which is very likely, considering the history of cloud price wars. See also: Can Google Lure More Enterprises Inside Its Data Centers? Elasticity vs Cost: the Cloud’s Big Trade-Off Amazon has had similar discounts for long-term upfront commitments for some time now. In fact, that was the only way an AWS user could get competitive pricing from the world’s largest cloud provider, Warrilow said. The user has to pay for three years upfront, and the agreement will specify the type of cloud VMs they will use for those three years. That’s where Google decided to make its move. The Alphabet subsidiary is not asking for an upfront payment, and it’s not asking you to specify what kind of cloud VMs you’ll be using for those three years. You buy compute cores and memory in bulk, Urs Hölzle, Google’s senior VP of technical infrastructure, said from stage at Next. And you get a big discount for buying in bulk and signing a one-year or a three-year contract. How you use those bulk resources during that time is up to you. You can change machine size at any moment, depending on your needs. “You’re only committing to the aggregate volume and not the details,” Hölzle said. Urs Holzle, Senior Vice President for Technical Infrastructure at Google, speaks during the Google I/O 2014 conference in San Francisco. (Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images) AWS added some configuration flexibility to its Reserved Instances last September, letting users switch the family of cloud VMs they use but only if the VMs they switch to have the same price. This category is called Convertible RIs, but that cost-equivalency requirement takes away from convertibility. Models like Amazon’s (he didn’t name Amazon, but the reference was clear) “force you to predict the future perfectly,” Hölzle said. “Like on-premise, we’re forced to buy servers in fixed sizes.” That approach diminishes the cloud’s promise of infrastructure elasticity in exchange for lower cost. According to Warrilow, the step will be a good one for Google, who said separating the ability to get a discount on cloud usage from how specifically you’re using it “is a competitive differentiator for them.” Analysis Shows Google Can Win on Price Elasticity aside, the size of the discounts Google is offering for these bulk cloud purchases may put Google ahead of Amazon on cost alone. The discount for a one-year commitment is 37 percent, and the discount for a three-year commitment is 55 percent. RightScale, a cloud management company that does a lot of research about the way companies use cloud services, decided to measure what that means in terms of actual cost, and how it compares to the cost of AWS. RightScale used cloud usage history of a real-world company (whom it did not name), to make the comparison and found that Google’s cloud would be 28 percent cheaper for that company than AWS Reserved Instances with a one-year commitment and 35 percent cheaper than AWS Convertible RIs with a three-year commitment: Chart: RightScale Google’s “committed-use discounts will be well-received,” Warrilow said. While the company still has a long way to go to catch up to its competitors in terms of making itself more “enterprise-friendly,” it’s taking all the right steps, such as expanding its partner program and beefing up its database of large customer use cases, he said. “There’s still good money to be made in all this, even with the price battles that have gone on.” See also: Google Expands Cloud Data Center Plans, Asserts Hardware, Connectivity Leadership Previous Article AWS Offers Cloud Credits to Alexa Skill Developers Next Article Google Data Center FAQ Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

Name: Subject: Message: (Update: ad removed) Google Home is running Beauty and the Beast ads as part of today’s briefing Newsby John Callaham2 days ago 14 195 18 Update: Engadget reports that the Beauty and the Beast ad has now been removed from Google Assistant and Home. A spokesperson for the company also now claims this message “wasn’t intended to be an ad”, stating that it was simply trying to “call out timely content”. However, the spokesperson did admit that “we could have done better in this case”. We would bet that this kind of in-your-face advertising won’t be popping up in the future, but Google does say it will continue “to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users”. Original story: If you own a Google Home connected speaker and ask it today to recite your regular daily briefing, you may get a bit of a surprise. In between letting you know your schedule of events and the weather forecast, the voice for Google Home will also throw in a “by the way” reminder that today is the opening day in theaters for Disney’s latest movie, the live-action Beauty and the Beast. See also: How to set up payments and shop with Google Assistant on Google Home February 16, 2017 You can check out a demo of this in action below: Google isn’t just pushing out these ads to Google Home speakers. According to multiple reports, the Beauty and the Beast ads are popping up on Google Assistant-enabled smartphones, too. After telling you a bit about the new movie, Assistant then says you can have some “more movie fun” with its own trivia game. It’s pretty obvious that Disney paid a lot of money to Google to thrown in that voice ad in Home and Assistant, and it’s the first time such an “feature” has presented itself in this way via the company’s digital AI. There’s no word yet on if this ad is a one-off, or if this is just the beginning of regular voice ads that will be delivered by Assistant. The Verge reached out to Google for more information, but oddly enough, the company denied that the audio clip was an advertisement. Google said: This isn’t an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales. Weird. That sure sounds like an advertisement to us. We would hope that owners of Google Home, who have already paid quite a bit of money to use the connected speaker, can also be given the option to shut down these rather annoying ads. They certainly didn’t think they would have to deal with these kinds of features. We would also hope the same courtesy will be given to Google Assistant users on smartphones. Do you think Google is going too far in throwing in voice ads for third-party products with the use of Home and Assistant?

With all the excitement taking place around many Marshmallow and Nougat-sporting smartphones, it seems no one really took the time to ask about Android tablets. Gee, shocker.  Anyway, Google specifies that Google Assistant will indeed be on Marshmallow and Nougat phones with the updated Google Play Services, but this will not include Android tablets. Sorry to Nexus 9, Pixel C and other tablet owners. No reasoning is provided, which is odd, but it’s just a move we’ll have to live with. It should be noted that Google didn’t completely close the door to tablets receiving the feature in the future, but who knows. Here’s what Google said. The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play Services, this does not include tablets. Boo.

J. Gilbertson seems like another way to fragment android more. there’s really no solid reasoning for this other than maybe google doesn’t want people frustrated when their primary device (phone) opens up assistant at the same time as their secondary device (tablet). However, this same argument could apply to people with a Google Home and Android phone so I really don’t get the reasoning. I also don’t think tablets are necessarily dead yet. they’re great to throw videos on and watch on the go so i’m not burning up my phone battery. Though I could get a chromebook to do that and not have to hold the device. bull3946 Writing was on the wall for Android tablets the minute they started the initiative to put the play store on ChromeOS.

Raven ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No, I would never tell you that. I know the market is very poor for tablets right now. I just really wish it wasn’t because there is nothing available right now that really fits what I want. I want a new 8″ Android tablet with the latest SOC. I want 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage plus a MicroSD card. I do not want LTE or any other cellular connectivity and I do not want a physical home button so Samsung is still out until they apply S8 styling to their tablet line. I would easily pay in the neighborhood of $500 for this. scottalias With rapid charging and a large battery. I would prefer LTE, personally. Orlando aka Pixel XL U sir r a tampon boi. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Um that was the stupidest response to date. Congrats. Raven ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I still use my good old Nexus 7 2013 and Asus Transformer. I like having a bigger screen for some things. I also have a nice 13.3 Windows 10 2-in-1 and a top of the line 15.6″ laptop that is usually hooked to a 24″ screen at home. Nothing beats the tablets for web surfing, news, reading, watching videos, or even watching movies when I fly. Unfortunately the tablet market is sadly depressed, but I really don’t understand why everyone who is into tech even a little doesn’t want to own at least one.

UK watchdog “close” to verdict in DeepMind Health data consent probe Posted Mar 16, 2017 by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story How does the Lucid Air stack up against the competition? The UK’s data protection watchdog has said it’s “close” to concluding a 10-month+ investigation into consent complaints pertaining to a patient data-sharing agreement inked between Google-owned DeepMind and the Royal Free NHS Trust which operates three hospitals in London. The ICO began its probe in May last year — after details emerged, via a FOI request made by New Scientist, of the large quantity and scope of patient identifiable data being shared with DeepMind by the Trust. The arrangement, inked in fall 2015, had been publicly announced in February 2016 but details of which and how much patient data was involved in the arrangement were not shared. Contacted for an update on the investigation today, an ICO spokesperson told TechCrunch: “Our investigation into the sharing of patient information between the Royal Free NHS Trust and Deep Mind is close to conclusion.” Under the DeepMind-Royal Free arrangement, the Google-owned AI company agreed to build an app wrapper for an NHS algorithm designed to alert to the risk of a person developing acute kidney injury. Patient data for the Streams app was obtained without patient consent, with DeepMind and the Trust arguing it is unnecessary as the app is used for ‘direct patient care’ — a position that has been challenged by critics, and is being reviewed by regulators. The ICO spokesperson added: “We continue to work with the National Data Guardian and have been in regular contact with the Royal Free and DeepMind who have provided information about the development of the Streams app. This has been subject to detailed review as part of our investigation. It’s the responsibility of businesses and organisations to comply with data protection law.” The medical records of some 1.6 million individuals are thought to be passed to DeepMind under the arrangement, although the data sharing is dynamic so there’s no static figure. Data shared under the arrangement includes real-time inpatient data from the Trust’s three hospitals across multiple departments, as well as historical in-patient data going back five years. As TechCrunch reported last August, the UK’s National Data Guardian (NDG) has also been reviewing how patient data was shared by the Trust. A spokeswoman confirmed today it is still liaising with the ICO in its investigation. Legal experts continue to dispute Deepmind and the Royal Free’s interpretation of NHS information governance guidelines — including in a new academic paper, published today in the journal Health and Technology, entitled Google DeepMind and healthcare in an age of algorithms, which calls for more to be done to regulate data transfers from public bodies to private firms. The study argues that “inexcusable” mistakes were made by the Royal Free and DeepMind, questioning the legal and ethical basis of Trust-wide data transfers, and criticizing the lack of transparency around the arrangement. The paper is authored by Dr Julia Powles, a research associate in law and computer science at the University of Cambridge, and Hal Hodson, a journalist with The Economist who obtained and published the original data-sharing agreement when working at New Scientist. Neither DeepMind nor the Royal Free NHS Trust responded to our requests for comment on the study. But a spokesperson for the NDG told TechCrunch: “Our consideration of this matter has required a thorough approach in which the NDG and her panel have kept patients’ rightful expectations of both good care and confidentiality at the forefront of discussions.” “The NDG has provided a view on this matter to assist the ICO’s investigation and looks forward to this being concluded as soon as practicable,” the spokesperson added. The original data-sharing agreement between the Royal Free and DeepMind was superseded by a second deal signed in November 2016 — which continued the sharing of broadly similar data types but included a commitment by the pair to publish “key agreements”, and introduced what they described as “an unprecedented level of data security and audit” — in a bid to win trust in the wake of controversy over the arrangement. The pair have always said patient data used for Streams is not being used by DeepMind to train AI models but a separate memorandum of understanding between them — dated January 2016 — sets out broader ambitions for their partnership to start applying artificial intelligence to Trust-held medical data to seek to accelerate and enhance clinical outcomes. (Which, as we have noted before, introduces another set of consent considerations for accessing sensitive and valuable publicly funded data.) The scope of the partnership between DeepMind and the Royal Free has also expanded since the first data-sharing arrangement, with the pair detailing plans last fall for the company to also build a data-sharing access infrastructure for the Trust — which will position DeepMind to facilitate/broker app developers’ access to NHS patient data via an API in the future. DeepMind has also said it intends to build a technical audit infrastructure to try to offer verifiable data access audits of how patient data is being used. Although, earlier this month, the company confirmed this infrastructure will not be in place in the near term — saying only that it hopes to have the “first pieces” of the centralized digital ledger implemented this year, emphasizing the difficulties and challenges involved in building it. Meanwhile, the Streams app has been rolled out to Royal Free hospitals, and patient identifiable data continues to flow to the Google-owned company — which is also now being paid by the Royal Free for its services. Commercial terms of the arrangement between DeepMind and the Trust have never been disclosed. Attempts to obtain the charging and invoicing details of the arrangement via FOI have been declined on “commercial sensitivity” grounds. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google DeepMind Founded 2010 Overview DeepMind Technologies Ltd. operates as an artificial intelligence company.

For the record, Australia had won that match by 45 runs, a feat they were to repeat by the same margin in the Centenary Test played at the same venue against the same opponent in 1977. Sometimes fact can be stranger than fiction! It’s laudable that Google, a true-blue Yankee company, should have paid attention to a sport that barely a dozen countries play seriously — with the US not being one of them.The big influence on Google putting out the Doodle would have been Indian audiences. If one-sixth of the world is obsessed with cricket, you ignore it at your own peril. There have been some dramatic changes in cricket in the past 140 years: three formats exist now, coloured clothing has replaced white in limited overs cricket and use of technology has become a vital component of the modern era. But where the Laws are concerned, changes have been few and far in between. Some more have been now been proposed by the ICC for ratification by the MCC in October, including red cards and penalty runs for errant players and teams.The biggest upheaval in the sport has been in the shift in power from England to India. MCC — by extension England — remains the custodian of the laws of cricket, but most other aspects of how the sport is run today is vested here. While Lord’s may still be the Mecca of cricket, the romanticism must be juxtaposed with New Age realities. India today is the El Dorado of cricket. This is where every player wants to come; this is from where the sport is kept in robust health. The hub of Indian cricket, where the BCCI is headquartered, is in Mumbai. Justifiably too, for this city remains the nursery of Indian cricket even if it may no longer be its citadel. The first Test in India was played here, Mumbai has given the most players to the national team, and at various levels, cricket is still best structured and conducted here, whatever the criticisms. The power of Indian cricket resides in a none-too-fancy building in the same precincts as Wankhede Stadium. This is where decisions fundamental to the game in India (and overseas) are taken. However, the gravitas that such responsibility demands, has in the past few years been shaken up by internecine shenanigans of the BCCI. These keep cricket hacks usually bemused, largely spellbound and permanently occupied. But after the IPL scam of 2013, the BCCI underestimated the crisis and the Supreme Court was forced to step in and ultimately appoint a committee of administrators to restructure the administration. After ICC chairman Shashank Manohar’s sudden resignation on Wednesday, all attention is again on the BCCI office in Mumbai from where the COA operates. What does this entail for Indian cricket? Manohar has cited ‘personal reasons’ for quitting. But his mercurial run in the past few years leaves this open to speculation. On finishing his first term as BCCI president, he said he was through with cricket administration. He then came out of retirement to head the BCCI again after Jagmohan Dalmiya’s death. Within six months, he resigned, after being assured of becoming the first independent ICC chairman. Eight months into this position, he’s quit again, leaving the cricket world in a flutter. Rumours abound that Manohar found himself on slippery ground after the BCCI managed to win over some more cricket boards to support its claims as the major beneficiary in the ICC’s distribution of revenue. Manohar had opposed this, and appeared to have the approval of the COA too, which now seems to have been vacated. Some observers even see this as the COA’s masterstroke. It helps Indian cricket retain its leadership in the ICC, which in turn makes the COA’s efforts to implement the Lodha Panel recommendations on recalcitrant state associations stronger. But that’s only a surmise. In fact, the situation is highly confounding. What is known, however, is that the Justice Lodha recommendations have no bearing on the ICC chairmanship. There is no age limit for it, nor is the sanction of a country’s Board necessary. One can hear wheels whirring within wheels, new equations being firmed, and old ambitions being stoked again among old BCCI stalwarts forced out into the cold recently. Watch this space.

Google is now directing its review teams to flag content that might come across as upsetting or offensive in search results, such as content with 'racial slurs or extremely offensive terminology'. GOOGLE'S HUMAN QUALITY RATERS  Google has over 10,000 quality raters, contractors worldwide that evaluate search results.  Raters are given actual searches to conduct, drawn from real searches that Google sees.  They then rate pages that appear in the top results as to how good those seem as answers. Quality raters do not have the power to alter Google's results directly.   Instead, the data produced by quality raters is used to improve Google's search algorithms generally.  In time, that data might have an impact on low-quality pages that are spotted by raters, as well as on others that weren't reviewed. Quality raters use a set of guidelines that are nearly 200 pages long, instructing them on how to assess website quality and whether the results they review meet the needs of those who might search for particular queries.   For example, content with 'racial slurs or extremely offensive terminology' could now get flagged as such. While flagging something doesn't directly affect the search results themselves, it's used to tweak the company's software so that better content ranks higher. The changes were reported in the blog Search Engine Land.  Paul Haahr, one of Google's senior engineers who is involved with search quality, told the site 'We're explicitly avoiding the term 'fake news,' because we think it is too vague. 'Demonstrably inaccurate information, however, we want to target.' The guidelines , which run 160 pages, are an interesting look into how Google ranks the quality of its search results.  'As a Search Quality evaluator, you will work on many different types of rating projects,' it begins. For instance, it gives examples of 'high-quality' pages, such as the home page of a newspaper that has 'won seven Pulitzer Prize awards,' and 'low-quality' pages, such as an article that includes 'many grammar and punctuation errors.' The guidelines cite an example of 'Holocaust history' as a search query.  A resulting website listing 'Top 10 reasons why the holocaust didn't happen' would get flagged. Another example addresses a blog claiming Angela Merkel is the daughter of Adolph (sic) Hitler.

Share this article Share 50 shares 'Because the MC is inaccurate and misleading, it completely Fails to Meet the user intent, even though the topic of the page matches the query,' the guide says, adding 'A more helpful result for this query might confirm that Adolf Hitler had no children, or provide information on the novel Hitler's Daughter by Jackie French.' The new 'upsetting-offensive' flag instructs quality raters to 'flag to all web results that contain upsetting or offensive content from the perspective of users in your locale, even if the result satisfies the user intent.'  The guidelines also include examples. For instance, here's one for a search on 'holocaust history,' giving two different results that might have appeared and how to rate them 'The Internet contains all sorts of content, including content which many users find offensive or upsetting,' the Google guide says. 'Additionally, users of all ages, genders, races, and religions use the Internet to understand the world and other people's points of view.  'Users may issue queries on sensitive topics to understand why people believe, say, or do upsetting or offensive things.  'Search engines exist to allow users to find the information they are looking for. 'Please assign the Upsetting­Offensive flag to all web results that contain upsetting or offensive content from the perspective of users in your locale, even if the result satisfies the user intent.' Another example addresses a blog claiming Angela Merkel is the daughter of Adolph (sic) Hitler. So even if the results are what the person searched for, such as white supremacist websites, they could still get flagged.  But it doesn't mean the results won't show up at all when someone searches for them. Google has over 10,000 quality raters, contractors worldwide that evaluate search results. GOOGLE CONTENT CRACKDOWN   According to the updated guide, seen by Search Engine Land, Google is targeting: Content that promotes hate or violence against a group of people based on criteria including (but not limited to) race or ethnicity, religion, gender, nationality or citizenship, disability, age, sexual orientation, or veteran status. Content with racial slurs or extremely offensive terminology. Graphic violence, including animal cruelty or child abuse. Explicit how­ to information about harmful activities (e.g., how tos on human trafficking or violent assault). Other types of content which users in your locale would find extremely upsetting or offensive. Quality raters use a set of guidelines that are nearly 200 pages long, instructing them on how to assess website quality and whether the results they review meet the needs of those who might search for particular queries.   Raters are given actual searches to conduct, drawn from real searches that Google sees. They then rate pages that appear in the top results as to how good those seem as answers. Quality raters do not have the power to alter Google's results directly. Instead, the data produced by quality raters is used to improve Google's search algorithms generally. In time, that data might have an impact on low-quality pages that are spotted by raters, as well as on others that weren't reviewed. Quality raters use a set of guidelines that are nearly 200 pages long, instructing them on how to assess website quality and whether the results they review meet the needs of those who might search for particular queries.       Read more: Google launches new effort to flag upsetting or offensive content in search Share or comment on this article e-mail 50 shares Most watched News videos Terrifying video of 737 pilot fighting strong winds to land airliner No handshake for Merkel!

This beta operating system update has been accompanied by the news that Google will officially stop supporting Nexus 6 and Nexus 9. On the bright side though, Android 7.1.2 Nougat developer preview has brought the highly desirable fingerprint gestures support feature for Nexus 5X devices. The update has finally arrived to Nexus 6P smartphones and to everyone’s surprise it doesn’t include fingerprint gestures support. Nexus 6P Receives Android 7.1.2 Nougat Developer Preview We should mention that only Nexus 6P owners that are enlisted in Google’s Android Beta Program are eligible to download Android 7.1.2 Nougat. Back to the matter at hand, when Nexus 5X owners started reporting that their smartphones feature fingerprint gestures support, everyone expected that Nexus 6P owners are going to benefit from the same feature. Sadly, this isn’t the case. Nexus 6P Doesn’t Feature Fingerprint Gestures Support This isn’t some groundbreaking feature but it’s highly important that Nexus 6P is kept up to par with Nexus 5X. Especially since Nexus 6P is actually newer than Nexus 5X. Additionally, Nexus 6P used to hold the title as Google’s flagship smartphone until Pixel and Pixel XL were launched, therefore Google is expected to pay more attention to Nexus 6P. The Android parent has yet to announce what’s causing this feature delay but everyone suspects that Google just needs more time to optimize the feature before its stable. We can be sure that Nexus 6P is going to receive the same treatment in the upcoming future. Maybe the public version of Android 7.1.2 Nougat will include this feature. Additionally, worth noting is that Android 7.1.2 Nougat developer preview doesn’t include the latest March security bulletin. Instead, this update only features January’s security patch. Taking in consideration the fact that Google puts a high price on security, we can be sure that the public version of Android 7.1.2 Nougat will include the incremental March security patch. Nonetheless, all that Nexus 6P owners can do right now is wait and hope that Google is going to add fingerprint gestures support during the upcoming weeks.

When the smartphone was initially launched it quickly became one of the most popular Android powered smartphones ever made. The reason behind this is that Google provided customers with a stable stream of software updates while LG equipped the device with only high-end hardware parts. Nexus 5: Specs As previously mentioned, the device’s hardware specs is one of the reasons why Nexus 5 managed to sell so well. With that being said let’s pop up its hood and see what lies beneath. Right from the first glance we can see that Nexus 5 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 800 chipset. The processor is quite fast clocking in at 2.3GHz. Also, LG has coupled the processor with an Adreno 330 graphics processing unit and 2GB of RAM. Leaving the hardware power aside, Nexus 5 ships with a 4.95 Ture HD IPS+ capacitive touchscreen panel. The display features a full HD 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution and a large pixel density of 445 ppi. If that isn’t enough, readers should know that LG has also coated Nexus 5’s display in Corning Gorilla Glass 3 therefore increasing the panel’s shock resistance. Nexus 5 Has Been Left Behind Sadly, even though the smartphone features impressive hardware specs it pales in comparison with Google’s latest Pixel and Pixel XL smartphone offering. Back in 2013, the Android parent promised customers that Nexus 5 is going to have a long life but Google changed its mind as the years passed. Google decided to venture in the smartphone world by itself and designed Pixel and Pixel XL. The aforementioned devices started replacing the older Nexus branded devices. In fact, Google has received some harsh criticism from the Nexus community because it decided to stop supporting a large majority of Nexus devices. Although Google has the right to do that since Nexus smartphones are quite old. The reason why their age matters is because Google’s policy states that once a device reaches the two year milestone, Google isn’t forced to support it anymore. Nonetheless, Nexus 5 owners can always change their smartphone with Google’s newest Pixel or Pixel XL smartphone. These devices are known as the best Android powered devices ever made and they are more than capable of replacing Nexus 5.

Back in October, 2017 Google decided to leave the likes of Huawei, LG and Motorola behind and venture into the smartphone world by itself with Pixel and Pixel XL. The Android parent has received some harsh criticism because it decided to take on the role of OEM. Google Stops Helping OEMs The Android parent is known for always teaming up with different tech manufacturers and creating devices that are then branded under the Nexus name. Well, now Google has decided to take a different route and show everyone that it can do all of this on its own. This is why Google stopped working with OEMs. What’s interesting is that the tech community started lashing back at Google for the decision it made. Even though Android fans were happy to receive a “pure” Android experience, fans of Samsung, Motorola and so on aren’t that happy. The reason behind is that these OEMs will no longer have the necessary tools to make their devices the best when it comes to software support. Although it’s pretty clear why Google decided to walk on its own path. The previously mentioned smartphones were selling quite well because of the amount of software support Google was providing these devices with. Additionally, the fact that Google is directly managing the Nexus brand inspired trust among customers. This is why Google considered that it was ready to start producing its “self-made” smartphone and stop sharing profits with other OEMs. Another good reason behind Google’s decision to stop working with OEMs is because they now represent competition. As everybody knows by now, the smartphone industry is the most competitive one. All major companies are coming with new smartphones every month and this is increasing the competition. Additionally, new tech manufacturers keep on joining in the race every year. For example, Chinese manufacturers have flooded the market with cheap smartphones that provide customers with impressive hardware performances. Nonetheless even though Google decided to manufacturer Pixel and Pixel XL on its own, we can safely say that this was a wise decision. Google has been generating huge amounts of profits as a result. Also, we can be sure that the highly anticipated Pixel 2 will be even more successful than the already existing smartphones.

Everyone was upset when Samsung announced that its highly anticipated Galaxy S8 smartphone flagship will not be unveiled during MWC. On the bright side though, Samsung decided to compensate for that and showcase its Galaxy Tab S3. This is one of the best tablets ever made and it’s expected to compete against Google’s not-yet released Nexus 7 (2017). Rumor has it that Google wants to revamp the Nexus brand by launching a new tablet. Even though the Android parent has yet to unveil the tablet’s specs, the internet is filled with rumors and speculations about it. We have rounded up the most liable ones so that we can compare Nexus 7 (2017) against Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S3. Google Nexus 7 (2017) vs Samsung Galaxy Tab S3: Specs The Android parent is expected to equip Nexus 7 (2017) with a 7.0 inch AMOLED panel. The display is said to feature a high screen resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. On the other hand, Samsung’s tablet has been equipped with a larger 9.7 inch Super AMOLED display which features a pixel resolution of 1536 x 2048 pixels. It looks like Google’s Nexus 7 (2017) has an edge over Galaxy Tab S3 when it comes to resolution, but Galaxy Tab S3 has the upper hand in terms of size. Leaving the display aside, let’s take a look at what these tablets will bring in terms of hardware power. Nexus 7 (2017) is expected to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 chipset. The processor is going to be coupled with 4GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage space. These hardware specs are quite impressive but now let’s take a look at Galaxy Tab S3’s specs. Samsung is known for always going over the board when it comes to power. Therefore, Galaxy Tab S3 is fueled by the same high end Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset. The difference is that it will be paired with an Adreno 530 graphics processing unit and 4GB RAM alongside 32GB of expandable storage space. The fact that Samsung provides customers with expandable storage space is gives Galaxy Tab S3 a great advantage over Nexus 7 (2017). Although we don’t know everything that Nexus 7 (2017) is going to feature we have to give it to Samsung’s tablet.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS Google says Google Home’s ‘Beauty and the Beast’ ad is not an ad Khari Johnson@kharijohnsonHarrison Weber@harrisonweber March 16, 2017 12:37 PM Tags: Advertisement, Beauty and the Beast, Disney, Google, Google Assistant, intelligent assistant, marketing, movies Above: Google Home Image Credit: Google Home screenshot Google Home users heard an advertisement today along with their daily update; however, Google denies the statement was an ad. The audio clip lasting roughly 15 seconds was removed from Google Home by Thursday afternoon. Today when people told the smart speaker “Tell me about my day,” after it rattled off weather, commute times, and calendar events, Google Assistant said, “By the way, Disney’s live action Beauty and the Beast opens today. In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer if you ask me. For some more movie fun, ask me to tell you something about Belle.” In our tests, repeated attempts to find out something about Belle result in error messages. “This isn’t an ad,” a Google spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. “The beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales.” Around 3 p.m. Google issued another statement. “What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case,” a Google spokesperson said. A tale as old as time? The audio message certainly appears to be an advertisement, as Disney, a massive corporation, is in the midst of marketing its Beauty and the Beast remake. That sentiment was shared by many of Google Home’s users on Reddit this morning. Google Assistant is currently in the midst of its largest expansion since its launch, enabling Google Assistant in Android phones and publishing several new actions on Google Home in recent weeks. The Disney film ad on the platform today may amount to just a hiccup for users, but perhaps it’s also a sign that Google, primarily an advertising company, may be interested in selling promotions or ads someday on top of its Google Assistant service. Updated 3:27 p.m.: to include an additional statement from Google and to state that the Beauty and the Beast ad has been removed. Updated 1:36 p.m.: A person familiar with the matter later said no money was exchanged between Disney and Google for the Beauty and the Beast advertisement.

Palo Alto, California (PRWEB) March 16, 2017 Lilt, a Palo Alto-based startup, outperformed titans of the technology industry in a rigorous test of language translation tools. The company’s interactive translation system–the first such commercial system–outperformed the most heavily used systems from Google, Microsoft, and Systran, and SDL by a large margin. This outcome shows that systems incorporating human feedback beat systems that don’t, and are on par with the latest, expensive artificial intelligence from Google. Lilt’s interactive system that adapts to human input is one of the most exciting developments in language translation. The company tested this system against Google, Microsoft, Systran and SDL by comparing industry-standard BLEU scores on an English to German and English to French translation of Swiss government documents. Lilt matched Google’s latest neural machine translation system, and outperformed all of the other systems by a healthy margin. “Artificial Intelligence will change every industry and every line of business. However, human experts are still needed to guarantee commercial accuracy and quality. Our interactive system makes those experts more productive, and learns from their feedback, which is an overlooked source of valuable data,” said Ash Fontana, Managing Director of Zetta Venture Partners – the first venture capital fund in the world dedicated to artificial intelligence. Neural-network based systems also hold a lot of promise in improving language translation. Google released a neural network-based system in November 2016 that improved their system more in a single leap than they’d seen in the last ten years combined. However, their system is expensive, requiring a week of training on 96 advanced, GPU-based systems, costing about $11,000. Lilt’s system costs just $29 to train and produces results on par with Google’s neural network system with a BLEU score of 33.1 vs 33.2 for English to French and 28.2 vs 28.6 for English to German. Lilt’s system beat Microsoft’s latest neural system by a large margin with a BLEU score of 33.1 vs 30.7 for English to French and 28.2 vs 23.8 for English to German. Last month, Lilt announced the launch of Lilt Labs, a forum for computational linguists, scientists, and language professionals to publish evaluations, insights and research. The first article on Machine Translation Quality Evaluation offered quantitative assessments of major translation providers that combined the standard evaluation protocol with a typical translation workflow in which a human translator progressively translates a document. “We want to drastically increase levels of translation productivity by uniting artificial intelligence and translators together, in order to bring our customers into new markets,” said John DeNero, Co-Founder and Chief Scientist at Lilt, and Assistant Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley. “This bench marking is an important step in showing the world that interactive systems are the way forward. We welcome the entire community to join us in publishing results and insights that will accelerate adoption of this powerful technology.” — Anyone wishing to join the discussion or register for more information can do so at http://labs.lilt.com.

Bloomberg Max Chafkin and Mark Bergen 2 days ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL 9 things that crush the value of your home The Russian oligarchs buying up the world © AP Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, left, and Anthony Levandowski, co-founder of Otto, pose for a photo in the lobby of Uber headquarters, Thursday, Aug. 18, 2016, in San Francisco. Travis Kalanick, the chief executive officer of Uber Technologies Inc., says he needs leadership help. He recently dispatched former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate sexual harassment claims against the company. His security team is reviewing a practice known as “Greyballing.” And he’s no longer going to any more meetings with President Trump. These damage-control initiatives—in response, respectively, to a leaked video in which Kalanick was rude to an Uber driver, a blog post by a former engineer, an admission that the company had been deliberately misleading police, and a customer boycott—were the result of a month’s worth of public-relations disasters. Taken alone, any of these would have been enough to slow down the famously fast-moving ride-hailing company. Taken together, they’ve caused some to question Uber’s viability and Kalanick’s staying power. Quotes in the article Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 64.87 +0.23 +0.36% Nokia Oyj NOK ▲ 5.46 +0.01 +0.18% Xerox Corp XRX ▼ 7.36 -0.05 -0.67% Ford Motor Co F ▼ 12.48 -0.22 -1.73% But none of these scandals has the potential financial impact of the one Uber has said the least about: a lawsuit from Alphabet Inc.—the parent of Google and Google’s self-driving car division, now called Waymo—over driverless cars. Waymo says Uber is in possession of, and is basing the future of its business on, technology that was stolen by a former employee. Self-driving technology has become a fixation for Kalanick. Developing a driverless car, he’s often said, is “existential” to Uber. If a competitor managed to get there first, it could easily replicate Uber’s core service (shuttling passengers) without its single largest cost (paying drivers). Over the course of a few weeks in 2015, Kalanick poached 40 researchers from the Carnegie Mellon University robotics lab, one of the country’s top autonomous vehicle research centers. Then, last summer, Uber became the first company to operate a fleet of autonomous taxis, in downtown Pittsburgh. On the day it announced that service, Uber also said it had acquired Otto, a self-driving truck startup founded in January 2016 by a former Google employee, Anthony Levandowski. The 37-year-old engineer was an original member of Google’s car team and a protégé of its creator, Sebastian Thrun. At Google, Levandowski had been both a brilliant engineer and a divisive manager, with a reputation for flouting corporate norms and skirting rules to get cars on the road as quickly as possible. He was so controversial, according to several former and current employees, that when he was being considered to lead the car team, a group of engineers revolted, causing Alphabet CEO Larry Page to rethink the choice and install a different leader, Chris Urmson. According to the legal complaint filed on behalf of Google’s driverless car division—as almost everyone at Waymo still refers to it—the company began investigating Levandowski last summer after learning that Uber had paid about $700 million for his months-old company. Google’s suit, filed in a San Francisco federal court, says its investigators uncovered a trove of digital evidence that hint at an unprecedented theft. According to the suit, Levandowski used his company laptop to download 14,000 design files from Google’s car project. He plugged a memory card reader into the laptop and, shortly afterward, wiped all the data from the laptop. The suit also alleges that two other Otto employees took files on their way out the door. Google seemed content to sit on that information until Dec. 13, when a Google employee received an email from a supplier that was working on components for the lidar sensor in the company’s first production car. Lidar—a portmanteau of “light” and “radar”—is the key component that allows an autonomous vehicle to, essentially, see its surroundings. (It’s also used to build maps.) Off-the-shelf sensors cost up to $80,000 and contain several individual lenses. Under Levandowski, who’d led the lidar team, Google developed a much cheaper version that used a single lens. Strangely, though, the email’s subject line—“Otto Files”— made reference to Levandowski’s company. According to Google’s suit, the contents of the email, which seemed to have been intended for Uber rather than Google, included a machine drawing of a lidar circuit board that had Otto’s name on it but looked almost identical to Google’s. Two months later, Waymo sued Uber for trade secret theft and patent infringement, seeking damages and an injunction that could seriously impede Uber’s self-driving car program. At issue is a business that both companies believe will be worth hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars a year. And though both companies like to portray driverless cars as some near-term inevitability, this dispute shows just how messy the race to get there could prove to be. During new-hire orientation, engineers at Google are frequently told that the company will never sue a former employee for patent infringement. The implication is twofold: first, that Google doesn’t stoop to fighting over patents, though it may employ them to protect itself from people who aren’t in the business of changing the world. (“These patent wars are death,” Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said at an event in 2012, calling patent litigation “bad for innovation.”) And, as an extension of that, if Google sues you over a patent issue, you must have really pissed them off. After the lawsuit was filed, Uber released a statement characterizing it as “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.” At an all-hands meeting at the company’s Pittsburgh research center, Levandowski defended Uber’s lidar technology as “clean”—that is, not the product of stolen design documents—and told the company’s engineers that he’d downloaded the files to work from home. Some former colleagues seem to think that even if Levandowski did what Google alleges, he doesn’t deserve to be punished. “Whatever Google may say about him stealing lidar trade secrets, he was the lidar team at Google,” says someone who worked at the company’s driverless car program. “This is like the Swiss patent office suing Einstein for inventing the theory of relativity while he worked there.” The comparison to Einstein is obviously hyperbolic, but it also captures the foundational role Levandowski played in the development of self-driving cars. Levandowski, 6-foot-6 and relentlessly intense, is as much an entrepreneur as he is an engineer. At 16 he started a web design firm that a former colleague says made him a millionaire by the end of high school. (Levandowski didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.) As a University of California at Berkeley undergraduate, he won a national competition sponsored by Lego—he built a toy robot that could sort Monopoly money. Levandowski was 22 and working toward an MBA and an industrial engineering master’s at Berkeley when he first heard about the Darpa Grand Challenge. (His mother read about it and mentioned it to him.) The 2004 competition, organized by the U.S. Department of Defense, involved a race for robotic cars on a 150-mile course in the Mojave Desert. It drew teams from Carnegie Mellon, the California Institute of Technology, a number of defense contractors, and most of the other big names in robotics. Levandowski led a ragtag team of Berkeley graduate students and research assistants. If there was hubris in entering, there was even more in his chosen design. Ghostrider, his self-balancing, self-driving motorcycle, was the only two-wheel vehicle in the contest. “I was assuming the driving part would be easy to solve,” he said last summer, speaking to Bloomberg Businessweek in a joint interview with Kalanick shortly before Uber announced its acquisition of Otto. “I wanted to make something actually difficult.” Although it failed to stay upright on race day—a grainy YouTube video documenting Ghostrider’s run is six seconds long—the bike was still seen as an achievement by Levandowski’s peers, partly because no team finished. (Ghostrider eventually became part of the Smithsonian’s permanent collection.) For the next competition, in 2005, Levandowski served as the team leader for Ghostrider while also working on lidar sensors for the winning team from Stanford, which was managed by Thrun. Levandowski and two Berkeley friends adapted the technology from Ghostrider, which had used GPS and cheap digital cameras, into a commercial product. Their company, 510 Systems LLC, sold camera systems, and eventually lidar, to mapping companies, including Nokia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. Levandowski also sold kits to automate agricultural and construction equipment. In 2007, Google hired Thrun’s team from Stanford to work on a new product, Street View, formally making Levandowski a full-time employee of the search company even as he continued to run 510. The initial plan was to supplement Google’s maps, which at the time used data licensed from the mapping giant Navteq Corp., with pictures of city streets. Levandowski suggested that Thrun’s mapping technology could allow Google to replace Navteq’s data altogether. His mapping initiative was seen as an enormous success, allowing Google to offer on phones turn-by-turn driving directions that were as good as those offered by standalone GPS device makers. In 2008, while doing double-duty at Google and 510, he took a call from a producer at the Discovery Channel who wanted to borrow Ghostrider for an episode of Prototype This!, a short-lived documentary series. Levandowski suggested instead that he use a different vehicle. He asked Google for permission to embark on the stunt using sensors similar to those on Google’s mapping cars. It was granted on the condition that Levandowski, and not Google, would be responsible if something went wrong. “The lawyers said, ‘Absolutely, but please don’t put Google on the side,’ ” Levandowski told Bloomberg Businessweek in the interview last summer. “So we started this thing called Anthony’s Robots to be very clear it wasn’t Google-related.” A few weeks later, under a police escort and with cameras rolling, the Pribot, as Levandowski named his converted Toyota Prius, successfully crossed the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Google’s self-driving car project began the following year with a modified Prius that used software created by Thrun at Stanford and hardware supplied by Anthony’s Robots. Like 510 Systems, Anthony’s Robots was operated as an independent company. The arrangement—whereby Levandowski was at once a founding member of the Google self-driving car team and a vendor who was also selling technology to other companies—was well-known to Google executives, though it was never publicly disclosed. “Anthony is a rogue force of nature,” says a former Google self-driving car executive. “Each phase of his Google career he had a separate company doing exactly the same work.” According to two former Google employees, founders Page and Sergey Brin tolerated Levandowski’s freelancing because they saw it as the fastest way to make progress. Google’s car team embraced Levandowski’s nature, too. The attitude, says a former colleague, was “he’s an asshole, but he’s our asshole.” As Google’s car project grew, a debate raged inside the company, reflecting a broader dispute about the direction of autonomous vehicles: Should the tech come gradually and be added to cars with drivers (through features like automatic parking and highway autopilot) or all at once (for instance, a fleet of fully autonomous cars operating in a city center)? Urmson, a former Carnegie Mellon professor, preferred the latter approach, arguing that incremental innovations might, paradoxically, make cars less safe. Levandowski believed otherwise and argued that Google should sell self-driving kits that could be retrofitted on cars, former colleagues say. Urmson won out, and according to two former employees, Levandowski sulked openly. After one dispute between the two, Levandowski stopped coming to work for months, devoting his time to his side projects. This didn’t stop Page and Brin from discreetly acquiring 510 Systems and Anthony’s Robots for roughly $50 million in 2011. As Google’s driverless car program matured, Levandowski seemed to become impatient. Creating a fully functioning driverless car means training a complicated hardware and software system to identify lane lines and red lights and to control the car’s movements. It also means writing software that anticipates thousands of unlikely “edge cases”—hairpin turns, drivers who use hand signals, covered bridges, recumbent bikes, and so on. That work seemed to bore Levandowski. He became increasingly frustrated at Google’s inability to operate its cars on city streets and decided to take matters into his own hands. “Engineers were like, ‘We are totally ready to go,’ and I’m like, ‘Let’s go then. Let’s see whether it’s real or a demo,’ ” Levandowski said in the summer interview. Without formally telling Google, which considered its cars not yet ready for open-road tests, he hired a lobbyist in Nevada and wrote a law that allowed companies to test autonomous cars with so-called safety drivers. (Self-driving car companies use the term to describe an engineer who sits in the driver’s seat with her hands on the wheel in case the car malfunctions.) The law passed at the end of 2011, though Google hasn’t conducted large-scale tests in the state. Google’s government relations department learned about Levandowski’s Nevada efforts when the lobbyist, David Goldwater, sent the company an invoice. Levandowski first met Kalanick in 2011 at a TED conference, but the two didn’t become close until early 2016, after Levandowski pitched Kalanick on an investment in Otto. Kalanick didn’t invest—but he did begin meeting with Levandowski in secret. In the interview with Bloomberg Businessweek at the time of the acquisition, Kalanick described these rendezvous in detail: The two would go to the San Francisco Ferry Building after sunset, entering separately and each picking up takeout food. They’d begin walking west toward the Golden Gate Bridge, where they’d eventually join up and begin talking. Kalanick recalled that he and Levandowski went on five or so of these walks, each one lasting several hours. Kalanick, now 40, was taken by the younger man’s hustle and sense of purpose, describing him as a “brother from another mother.” To get self-driving cars to production, Kalanick said in the interview, “it can’t just be about science. It has to be about engineering and entrepreneurialism that takes us into the real world. That’s where Anthony and I connect, right?” Levandowski, who was sitting next to him, nodded. “We think very similarly in terms of how do we get things out onto the world fastest,” he said. “How do we make a difference, how do we make impact, how do we get people using our technology.” Levandowski hinted that he’d decided to break with Google and start Otto in part out of frustration at the slow pace of innovation at Google. That might not have been the whole story. On March 10, Google, which is seeking a preliminary injunction to stop Uber from using its technology, filed written testimony from Pierre-Yves Droz, Levandowski’s co-founder at 510 Systems and the technical lead on Google’s lidar program. Droz wrote that in the summer of 2015 Levandowski said Uber might be interested in “buying the team” and that in January 2016 he told Droz he would “replicate” the company’s lidar. When Levandowski quit to start Otto, he was escorted out by Google security. A handful of Google employees soon followed him to the new company. Soon after, Levandowski began making trips to Uber’s self-driving car research center in Pittsburgh, where a staff that had grown to 500 was scrambling to launch the pilot taxi service. Levandowski wasn’t widely introduced; senior managers believed he was a consultant. “As far as the team knew,” says a former employee, Levandowski was “some guy who would come around and be annoying.” At Otto’s San Francisco headquarters, the startup, which had 90 or so employees, prepared for its product launch in May. Down a stretch of Nevada highway, the company ran a self-driving big-rig truck kitted out with sensors and computer controllers. Documents uncovered by the tech publication Backchannel showed that Levandowksi had sought the approval of state regulators to film the demo. When they denied his request to do the run, he went through with it anyway. (Goldwater, again serving as Levandowski’s lobbyist, argued in an email to the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles that it had no jurisdiction in the matter. A senior DMV administrator called the test “illegal” in an internal email but declined to rebuke Otto publicly.) In August, Uber acquired Otto for roughly $700 million in company stock. The plan, Kalanick said, was to continue building Otto’s trucking business and to use the startup’s homegrown lidar to beef up Uber’s own self-driving cars, all under Levandowski’s supervision. Uber’s Pittsburgh team learned of the acquisition, and the fact that they had a new boss, the day it was announced. “The team was super unhappy,” says a former employee. It turned out that Otto’s lidar was a work in progress—the company’s prototype trucks were still using sensors manufactured by Velodyne Lidar Inc. “We thought we were getting some supersecret sauce by joining them,” says the employee. “But they did smoke and mirrors and got a huge acquisition offer.” Over the next six months, about 15 of the original 40 Carnegie Mellon engineers left. At least three have subsequently founded competing self-driving car companies, one of which recently received a $1 billion investment over five years from Ford Motor Co. Levandowski seemed to struggle in other ways as well. In December, Uber dispatched 16 self-driving cars, with safety drivers, in San Francisco without seeking a permit from the California DMV. The test went poorly—on the first day, a self-driving car ran a red light, and the DMV ordered Uber to halt its program in the state. The company suffered further embarrassment when a New York Times article, citing leaked documents, suggested that Uber’s explanation for the traffic violation—that it had been caused by human error—wasn’t complete. The car malfunctioned, and the driver failed to stop it. The misdirection came as no surprise to the Uber employees who’d spent time at Otto’s San Francisco headquarters. Someone there had distributed stickers—in OSHA orange—with a tongue-in-cheek slogan: “Safety third.” In Silicon Valley, litigation is looked upon as the last refuge of the undisruptive Uber has yet to file a legal response to Google’s complaint—a spokeswoman says it plans to do so later this month—but the company essentially has two options: It can settle with Waymo and license its sensors, or it can fight. “What Waymo probably wants is to license its patents to Uber,” says Robert Gomulkiewicz, a former Microsoft intellectual-property lawyer who’s now a professor at the University of Washington School of Law. “In this kind of litigation, that’s the typical sequence of events.” That said, this isn’t a typical patent dispute, and Uber isn’t a typical company. If it fights, it could argue, as Levandowski did at the all-hands meeting in Pittsburgh, that the alleged document dump was simply part of an effort on his part to work from home. It could also cite how Google seemed to encourage Levandowski’s freelance excursions. And while many of his former colleagues assume that Google wouldn’t sue Levandowski if the forensic evidence wasn’t incontrovertible—that is, if it didn’t have him dead to rights—other former colleagues and some industry insiders see the lawsuit as evidence that Google is struggling to make up for its failure to bring a product to market quickly. “Google is the Xerox Parc of self-driving cars,” says George Hotz, the founder of Comma.ai, another autonomous car startup. It’s a backhanded compliment: Although Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center invented the modern computer operating system, it didn’t bring the invention to market; Apple Inc. did. “The real question is, why hasn’t Google shipped?” Hotz asks. He regards Google’s lawsuit as a deliberate conflation of two different beefs. The first—the accusation that Levandowski stole documents—is serious. The second, Hotz says, “just signals weakness on Google’s part.” In Silicon Valley, and at the Googleplex, litigation is looked upon as the last refuge of the undisruptive. Whatever Levandowski did with Google’s files, he’s not wrong that Google has struggled to commercialize technology that’s widely regarded as the best in the automotive industry. Before Google worked on its current prototype, a two-seater that has a top speed of 20 miles per hour and vaguely resembles a koala bear, the company pitched Elon Musk on outfitting his electric Tesla vehicles with Google tech, according to two people familiar with the deal. Musk passed and a few years later launched Tesla Inc.’s highway autopilot service on his own. A former Google executive says John Krafcik, who joined the car project as CEO in 2015, would sometimes appear rattled by the competitive moves of Tesla and Uber, wondering aloud if Google may have already been “leapfrogged.” He would grow particularly irritable “every time Elon would post something on Twitter,” the executive says. Levandowski hasn’t shown any sign of being rattled or contrite. Three days after the lawsuit hit, he appeared onstage in Barcelona as a marquee speaker at the Mobile World Congress. The lawsuit never came up. As a final question, the moderator, the chief marketing officer of a cell phone industry trade group, simply asked, “Do you drive?” Levandowski smiled. “Sometimes I drive, and sometimes I’m driven,” he said. “That’s the beauty of being able to work on this project—you get to see the technology evolve and get better over time.” “Absolutely fascinating stuff,” the moderator replied. “Please, everyone: a round of applause for Anthony.” The crowd, stacked with top executives from the world’s biggest companies, complied enthusiastically. —With Dana Hull and Ashlee Vance To contact the authors of this story: Max Chafkin in New York at mchafkin@bloomberg.net, Mark Bergen in San Francisco at mbergen10@bloomberg.net.

The company did not mention tablets. Still, some Android tablet users held out hope that Google had misspoken or forgot to mention tablets were included in the rollout. Google has now confirmed definitively Android tablets aren’t included in the current expansion of Assistant. In a statement issued to Android Police, a Google spokesperson said, “The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play Services, this does not include tablets.” Android Police went on to ask Google for a timeline of when it intends to push Assistant to Android tablets, which the company declined to provide. Whether that means Assistant will ever come to tablets is unclear. For the time being, Android tablet users will have to turn to their smartphones to check out Google’s personal assistant.

Pingback: Marshmallow and Nougat rollout of Assistant doesn’t include tablets, Google confirms | Daily Update() Shogun Well in reality there is probably little need for this in tablets anymore than there is a need for Siri on an iPad, likely a feature few bother using. I’ve owned iPads since they first came out and since the advent of Siri I’ve yet to use it on the device. Brad Fortin Your mileage may vary. Whenever I need Siri I tend to just shout “Hey Siri” and let the nearest device take the query, which often enough just happens to be the iPad.

 Google says the voice ads on Google Home aren't really ads Steve Kovach Mar. 16, 2017, 3:14 PM 2,442 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson/Business Insider As Google moves toward screen-free computing powered by digital assistants and artificial intelligence, one of the big questions the company faces is how it'll translate its lucrative advertising to those platforms. Now we're starting to get an idea. Some users of the new Google Home connected speaker have noticed audio ads for Disney's upcoming "Beauty and the Beast" remake. Here's a clip of the ad, taken by a Google Home user and posted to Twitter. The ad comes after the user gets an update on his day from the Google Assistant: New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO— brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 Now here's the rub. A Google spokesperson told Business Insider that the ad you just heard isn't an ad. "This isn't an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales," the spokesperson said in a statement. We're as confused as you are by that one, and plenty of others online were too. A few hours after the video began circulating, Google removed the mention of "Beauty and the Beast" from Google Home. “This wasn’t intended to be an ad," A Google spokesperson told Business Insider. "What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case." A source familiar with the partnership has since confirmed to Business insider that Disney did not pay Google for film's mention. Google CEO Sundar Pichai was asked multiple times by analysts on the company's last earnings call about how he plans to monetize voice-first products like Google Home. Pichai didn't have a clear answer, sticking to his common refrain that it's still "early days" for the technology. He also said voice is only "one mode" to control computers and "users will have many different ways by which they interact" with Google products. Get the latest Google stock price here.

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) FILE - This March 23, 2010, file photo, shows the Google logo at the Google headquarters in Brussels. Google is now letting its human "quality raters" flag content that is "upsetting" or "offensive" in search results. The quality raters can flag such content, and while this does not directly affect the search results themselves, it serves to teach the company’s algorithms to surface better results when users search for something. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Google is trying to improve the quality of its search results by directing review teams to flag content that might come across as upsetting or offensive. With the change, content with racial slurs could now get flagged under a new category called "upsetting-offensive." So could content that promotes hate or violence against a specific group of people based on gender, race or other criteria. While flagging something doesn't directly affect the search results themselves, it's used to tweak the company's software so that better content ranks higher. This approach might, for instance, push down content that is inaccurate or has other questionable attributes, thereby giving prominence to trustworthy sources. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The review teams — comprised of contractors known as "quality raters" — already comb through websites and other content to flag questionable items such as pornography. Google added "upsetting-offensive" in its latest guidelines for quality raters. Google declined to comment on the changes, which were reported in the blog Search Engine Land and elsewhere. The guidelines , which run 160 pages, are an interesting look into how Google ranks the quality of its search results. For instance, it gives examples of "high-quality" pages, such as the home page of a newspaper that has "won seven Pulitzer Prize awards," and "low-quality" pages, such as an article that includes "many grammar and punctuation errors." The guidelines cite an example of "Holocaust history" as a search query. A resulting website listing "Top 10 reasons why the holocaust didn't happen" would get flagged. The new "upsetting-offensive" flag instructs quality raters to "flag to all web results that contain upsetting or offensive content from the perspective of users in your locale, even if the result satisfies the user intent." So even if the results are what the person searched for, such as white supremacist websites, they could still get flagged. But it doesn't mean the results won't show up at all when someone searches for them.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Holly Richardson: LDS repent for not voting Trump?

Some users are now getting upset because they didn’t know that apparently that also meant opting into Google’s ad business — the search giant’s bread and butter — and as you would have guessed, they’re P-freakin-O’d. As one user demonstrated on Twitter, asking Google Home about their daily agenda sparked Home to cleverly mention the opening of Beauty and the Beast (now in theaters) at the end. Here’s the direct quote from Assistant after speaking the time, weather, and daily commute times: “By the way, Disney’s live action Beauty and The Beast opens today. In this version of the story, Belle is the inventor instead of Maurice. That rings truer if you ask me. For some more movie fun, ask me something about Belle.” New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO — brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 According to the user (and others on Reddit) the ad wasn’t based on any previous search queries, so it would appear this is paid spot from the film’s production company. Google, again, makes a ton of money off their ad business so while this isn’t really too surprising, some feel like they’ve been duped and/or would like a way to opt-out. It’s also worth noting that some people are reporting that the ad is also showing up in Google Assistant on their phones, so this isn’t unique to Google Home. We’ve already tried getting the ad to play on our Pixel, but no luck so far. Google has yet to comment on exactly what’s going on here — and if we can expect to hear more spoken ads or opt-out — so we’ll update when or if they do. UPDATE: According to Business Insider, a Google spokesperson says the ads aren’t really ads… “This isn’t an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales.” Huh?

Never before have we witnessed a technology giant destroy a product with such precision-engineered idiocy. Don't be evil? Do us a favor. Promos for Disney's new Beauty and the Beast flick, released in American cinemas today, are being mixed into Google Home's responses to questions. In a test with a Home owned by a Reg writer, the chatbot device started touting the kids movie in between telling the time and news headlines. This is with the default configuration: no opt-ins or opt-outs. In a car-crash video, uploaded to Twitter by Bryson Meunier, a Google Home is asked: “Okay Google, what’s my day like?” The chatbot answers the question by telling him the time, the weather and what his commute is like. So far, so good. But then, it sneakily adds: “By the way, Disney’s live action Beauty and the Beast opens today.” Soft piano music is played, and the ad continues running. “For some more movie fun, ask me something about Belle. Have a good one,” it cheekily concludes, referring to the movie's character. Now, we're aware of the irony of complaining about ads spouted by a device, only to then offer to play the ad to you, but it's honestly so creepy and stupid, it'll make you reconsider the myth that Google hires only the smartest people on the planet. New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO — brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 Unsurprisingly, folks – who have shelled out $129 for one of these things – aren’t thrilled. “I'm not a fan of ads on this device. I don't believe I've done any searching for the film either, so I think it's not due to perceived interest. Has anyone else heard similar ads?” one bod wrote on Reddit. Google Home is just one of the few virtual assistants available. Most major technology companies are locked in a race to build the best chatbot, one that appeals to everyone. The chatbot hype has been riding on the coattails of AI. The technology is new and companies are keen to monetise these gadgets. Using it for advertising is the next obvious step, and Google are the first to trial this service. "Chatbots could totally be a trillion-dollar industry," Dan Gailey, co-founder of Radbots, a startup that is developing ways to add adverts into chatbots, previously told The Register. But adverts have to be relevant and added when it’s least likely to irritate the user, Gailey said. Perhaps someone should let Google know that. Google was not available for immediate comment. ® Updated to add Google's official response to this is absolutely pants-on-head mad: This isn't an ad; the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales. Another update Google's had a bit of a think, and now a spokesperson has come back to us with this: This wasn’t intended to be an ad. What’s circulating online was a part of our My Day feature, where after providing helpful information about your day, we sometimes call out timely content. We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case. Meanwhile, we gather Google Homes are no longer spamming Disney's Beauty and the Beast promos to unsuspecting households.

By riot's end, 19 people had been arrested.

Still, students have less to fear from a policing perspective than they do from a personal perspective, says University of Waterloo English professor Aimée Morrison, whose work focuses on multi-media and language. Aimée Morrison is a professor of English at the University of Waterloo. Her work focuses on language and digital media. (Aimée Morrison/Twitter) Waterloo Region Police charge 14 people, seize 4,400 beers (2014) What Waterloo police do with all the kegs they seize on St. Patrick's Day (2016) "You really don't want that photo of you throwing up in someone's rose bushes haunting Google searches of you forever," she said in an interview with CBC Kitchener-Waterloo's The Morning Edition Thursday.  The researcher then went on to list the three reasons why social media carries far more personal consequences to St Paddy's Day revelers than the law.  1. Events can grow out of control "Advertising events on social media or publicizing events as they happen can lead to events growing exponentially out of control," Morrison said, explaining some business owners have noted that when a student promotes their events online through social media, it can bring crowds of 300 to 400 people an hour.   Police break up massive house party at Brampton mansion She used the well-publicized example of the Brampton, Ont. mansion party of 2014, where a 17-year-old youth advertised a party he was planning in a mansion still under construction. As many as 2,000 people attend a party in a Brampton, Ont- area mansion on May 2, 2014 (Courtesy of SSalah/Twitter) "He said he was planning for about a thousand people, but 2,000 people showed up and there was such a lineup of people that they were breaking the windows to get into the house," she said. "The house was completely trashed and he called the police – on his own party – because it just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger."  Morrison said as the original invitation spread online and people started taking pictures and sharing them on social media, crowds started showing up just to observe the spectacle. "We perform sometimes for our cameras or for our social media feeds. We're doing ever more outrageous behaviour so we can take a picture of it and put it online," Morrison said. 2. Performing for the camera Morrison said the widespread adoption of smartphones with cameras means everyone is a photographer, which can compound a situation already rife with mayhem.  "People are always saying 'I didn't think it was going to spread' and it always does." - Aimée Morrison "We perform sometimes for our cameras or for our social media feeds.We're doing ever-more outrageous behaviour so we can take a picture of it and put it online," she said.  Morrison noted people will often share those photographs in an effort to glamourize bad behaviour, which can lead to others being copycats or engaging in one-upmanship to behave even more outrageously. What adds to the problem, Morrison said, is that the portability of smartphones and the spontaneous nature of commenting and reaction on social media makes potentially embarrassing pictures quick and easy to share over a vast social network.  "It's super easy to lose control of these photos. People will screen-grab Snapchats all the time. People will save things to their own camera rolls," she said.  "We think that something we document is only going to circulate in the audiences that we've originally chosen for it," she said, but over and over again we see images and videos spread beyond that scope.  Embarrassing student photos have gone viral, such as this image of students in 2016 dressed up as Viet Cong fighters wearing rice hats at an off-campus party thrown by Queen's University students in Kingston, Ont. (Twitter) Morrison's point is underscored by a 2016 incident at Queen's University in Kingston, after photos appeared online showing white people dressed as Buddhist monks, Middle Eastern sheiks, Mexicans and Viet Cong fighters in rice hats during an off-campus student party in Kingston, Ont. Queen's University investigates 'shockingly racist' student costume party "People are always saying 'I didn't think it was going to spread' and it always does. So if you don't want that picture to be seen by the entire world, don't share it on social media," she said.   3. Police use social media too Morrison said anyone advertising a party or sharing their outrageous behaviour through social media also risks grabbing the attention of police, who, like all of us, use social media.  "You can search Facebook right now and search for any events related to St. Patrick's in Waterloo, that's not hard to do," she said, noting officers are monitoring social media platforms using the same hashtags and filters students do.  "It's pretty easy to monitor," she said. "If students can discover them, law enforcement can discover them."  She said officers use the information to break up parties before they get out of hand and in cases where parties do go completely off the rails, officers will use online documentation as evidence in court.   A burned-out shell is all that's left of a vehicle that was overturned and torched by students after a 2012 St. Patrick's celebration in London, Ont. took a nasty turn. When a St Patrick Day celebration by Fanshawe College students in London, Ont. took a nasty turn and spilled into the streets in 2012, riots broke out. London's Fanshawe College suspends 8 students for riot St. Patrick's Day riot in London yields more arrest Rioters pelted police with glass bottles, vandalized nearby properties and overturned a car and set it on fire, doing $100,000 damage.  Police later used video taken during the riots to lay charges and Morrison said much of it was turned over by fellow party-goers.  "Many of the people attending these parties disapprove of this behaviour just as much as law enforcement would," she said.   Morrison recommends going to officially sanctioned events where someone else can take care of the policing and the cleanup, and your smartphone is less likely to get you in trouble. (Waterloo Regional Police Service/Twitter) Morrison said she realizes students are never going to leave their smartphones at home, so she shares this advice: Don't perform stunts for the camera. Don't plan events on social media. If you do want to party, go to an official event. "Let somebody else be in charge of the policing and the cleanup," she said. "Maybe these private house parties are not the way to go."

EugenioOrtega / Pixabay Android 7.1.1 Nougat brings good news for T-Mobile users Last summer, ZTE, ranked number one on the latest annual list of the World Intellectual Property Organization patent applications, released its Axon 7 flagship, and spent almost half of last year testing Android 7.0 Nougat. The update finally came in February. When Android Central asked ZTE representative about the delay, he replied that the engineers needed to get Daydream support correct and did not want to launch the software with an imperfect virtual reality experience. Last month, Android 7.0 Nougat brought several new features to the smartphone, including support for the Google Daydream platform. Now, with Android 7.1.1 Nougat – the most recent version of Android — Google is pushing things a little further, like with Wi-Fi Calling to some users. With Android 7.1.1 Nougat, users on the T-Mobile network will be able use the Wi-Fi calling feature. T-Mobile users will also be able to receive calls and send messages over Wi-Fi through this update.  In addition, the update brings Google’s security patches for February. This new update also brings several new emojis to the smartphone and rounded icon support in the launcher. Even Google’s “gender-equal” emojis are coming to this device. After the update, users will be able to send GIFs on supported apps directly from their keyboard. Google’s Daydream platform has received some optimizations as well. Android 7.1.1 makes Axon 7 more special Users who want to get this latest Android update can go to the settings, select the “System Update” option and check if an update is available on their device. On some devices, the update has not come yet because it takes time for an OTA update to become available to all of them. With its impressive features, speedy updates, smart design and reasonable price of $399.99, the Axon 7 (launched with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow) was already attracting many consumers. Now Android 7.1.1 Nougat makes the handset even more desirable. The Axon 7, announced in May 2016, sports a 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED display, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage (expandable). The device has a 3,250mAh battery and is powered by the Snapdragon 820 SoC.

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) AP Google hopes to improve search quality with 'offensive' flag By BARBARA ORTUTAY AP Technology Writer Mar 16, 2017 Updated Mar 16, 2017 (…) × Tired of seeing surveys on articles? If you are a subscriber, simply log in or Subscribe now! Virginia Mayo FILE - This March 23, 2010, file photo, shows the Google logo at the Google headquarters in Brussels. Google is now letting its human "quality raters" flag content that is "upsetting" or "offensive" in search results. The quality raters can flag such content, and while this does not directly affect the search results themselves, it serves to teach the company’s algorithms to surface better results when users search for something. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Google is trying to improve the quality of its search results by directing review teams to flag content that might come across as upsetting or offensive. With the change, content with racial slurs could now get flagged under a new category called "upsetting-offensive." So could content that promotes hate or violence against a specific group of people based on gender, race or other criteria. Story continues below video × Advertisement While flagging something doesn't directly affect the search results themselves, it's used to tweak the company's software so that better content ranks higher. This approach might, for instance, push down content that is inaccurate or has other questionable attributes, thereby giving prominence to trustworthy sources. The review teams — comprised of contractors known as "quality raters" — already comb through websites and other content to flag questionable items such as pornography. Google added "upsetting-offensive" in its latest guidelines for quality raters. Google declined to comment on the changes, which were reported in the blog Search Engine Land and elsewhere. The guidelines, which run 160 pages, are an interesting look into how Google ranks the quality of its search results. For instance, it gives examples of "high-quality" pages, such as the home page of a newspaper that has "won seven Pulitzer Prize awards," and "low-quality" pages, such as an article that includes "many grammar and punctuation errors." The guidelines cite an example of "Holocaust history" as a search query. A resulting website listing "Top 10 reasons why the holocaust didn't happen" would get flagged. The new "upsetting-offensive" flag instructs quality raters to "flag to all web results that contain upsetting or offensive content from the perspective of users in your locale, even if the result satisfies the user intent." So even if the results are what the person searched for, such as white supremacist websites, they could still get flagged. But it doesn't mean the results won't show up at all when someone searches for them. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Maybe you were expecting more out of the new iPhone and now wish you could switch to Android? Part of making the switch to Android is making sure all of your contacts arrive in one piece. It is extremely easy to move your contacts from iCloud to Google Contacts so that they appear on your shiny new Android phone the moment you log in. Here’s how you do it! Note: Although these instructions are on a Mac, they should be identical on a Windows PC or Linux. Access iCloud Contacts Visit iCloud.com and log in with your Apple ID. After logging in, choose the Contacts option to show your contacts. Export the Contacts Select the first contact in your list. Then hold down the shift key and select the last contact on your list. This will select all the contacts on your list. Click the gear in the lower left-hand corner and select Export vCard… When the save window opens, save your file to someone on your computer you will remember. We recommend the Desktop. Login to Google Contacts Head on over to Google Contacts and login.   Click the More drop down and select Import… Import the Contacts   A dialog box will appear describing what is about to happen. Click the Choose File box to continue.   Select the backup file you saved earlier and choose open.   Finally, click the Import button to begin importing the contacts.   After a few seconds all of your contacts will appear in the My Contacts list in Google Contacts. The next time an Android phone or tablet is connected to the Google account, all of the contacts on this list will sync to the device. Thankfully both Apple and Google support the vCard standard for contacts which makes it incredibly easy to move from one ecosystem to another. Also, doing it yourself can save you a transfer fee at a local cell phone retailer, as some have been known to charge. Good luck and happy transferring! 44 Responses 10/30/2013 Dr Hatim Reply thankyou. this really helped. have a good day! 11/02/2013 Yahnette B Reply THANKS ALOT!!!! :) 11/16/2013 Malar Reply thank u sooo much!!!!! :) 11/30/2013 grateful anon Reply My iPhone was shut off before I was able to transfer contacts and every other method required me to be able to use email, I was beginning to think I would have to manually re-enter 250+ contacts and then I found this.

In Android, you will see contacts under ‘imported’ section. 12/11/2013 Barry Collin Reply Success! I’ve got all the contacts in my Moto G phone.

In the message, it says “Error: Backup and Sync is disabled for this account”, with an incomplete e-mail address “uploader-eng@” as whom to contact.  Rebooting does not clear the issue and this has also appeared on several computers here using both personal and workplace Google accounts that received the update. It is unclear whether this is a problem with the new Backup and Sync client or whether Google forgot to enable something before releasing this to the public.   Either way, once the ‘Quit’ button is clicked, the software fully exits and this message reappears the moment Backup and Sync is launched or when the computer is restarted. For now, the main workaround we found is to uninstall Backup and Sync and reinstall Google Drive, which continues to work and sync fine.  The affected Backup & Sync product we received is version 2.33.5025.7556: Update 17th March: It appears that this was an unintentional development release based on reports around the web and someone showing us the following screen that appeared on their computer: The following is how it appeared in the start menu: It appears that anyone with this release will automatically be reverted back to Google Drive as what happened with this computer shortly after the screenshots were taken.

Name: Subject: Message: Swatch announces it’ll develop its own OS for smartwatches Newsby Brian Reigh3 days ago 4 310 19 Shutterstock Switzerland’s largest watchmaker has announced that it will develop its own OS for upcoming smartwatches, competing directly with Google and Apple. See also: Will AI assistants spark renewed interest in wearables? 2 weeks ago According to Bloomberg, Swatch CEO Nick Hayek said in an interview that the Swiss watchmaker will develop its own wearable OS that is more efficient in saving power and protecting user data and will launch a model by the end of 2018 under its Tissot brand. Swatch’s announcement is in sharp contrast with the recently announced TAG Heuer smartwatch, developed in conjunction with Google and Intel. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek said in an interview that the Swiss watchmaker will develop its own wearable OS that is more efficient in saving power and protecting user data and will launch a model by the end of 2018 under its Tissot brand. It’s true that there have been growing doubts around Google’s wearable OS and wearables in general. People expect smartphone-like features as well as a long-lasting battery life inside a small timepiece, something that no manufacturer can deliver with today’s technology. That’s likely why some Android OEMs have quit the smartwatch market altogether for now or have moved onto a platform that allows for more freedom and flexibility à la Gear S3 running Tizen OS. According to Hayek, speaking at the headquarters of Omega – a sub-brand owned by Swatch Group – the company is trying to “think small”: There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturize and have an independent operating system. He added that there have been around 100 requests so far for more information on this upcoming proprietary OS and that Swatch plans to provide its OS to third parties as well. Although some are skeptical that Swatch’s OS would be adequate in satiating consumer needs, I think that if it executes well the idea of miniaturization, it can carry over the success that connected hybrid watches saw to true smartwatches. Though I don’t imagine it being app-rich like Apple’s ecosystem or even Google’s, if Hayek and his company can create a good-looking Tissot timepiece that is both smart and long-lasting, then perhaps all this is worth the effort.

 The Guardian has pulled all advertising from Google in protest after its ads appeared next to 'extremist' content Lara O'Reilly Mar. 16, 2017, 2:10 PM 2,959 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Guardian CEO David Pemsel.The Guardian The Guardian has pulled all its online advertising spend from Google's services after it found some ads for its membership scheme appeared next to extremist content, the newspaper reported. An ad agency acting on behalf of The Guardian ran a programmatic ad campaign using Google's Adx ad exchange. Programmatic advertising allows advertisers to target large audiences across a swathe of websites, using automated systems, rather than needing to buy each ad placement individually. Programmatic advertising is seen as an efficient way to reach specified audiences online, but it can also carry a brand safety risk, with some ads inadvertently appearing next to undesirable content if proper whitelists, blacklists, and other safety checks are not put in place by both the ad platform and the ad buyer. On this occasion, The Guardian says its ads appeared next to YouTube videos of American white nationalists, a hate preacher that is banned in the UK, and a "controversial" Islamic preacher. The Guardian's discovery comes a month after an investigation from The Times found a number of big brand ads were appearing next to YouTube videos created by hate groups. David Pemsel, The Guardian chief executive, wrote in a letter to Google EMEA boss Matt Brittin: "Given the dominance of Google, DoubleClick and YouTube in the digital economy, many brands feel that it is essential to place advertising on your platform. It is therefore vital that Google, DoubleClick and YouTube uphold the highest standards in terms of openness, transparency, and measures to avoid advertising fraud and misplacement in the future. It is very clear that this is not the case at the moment." Pemsel is also calling on other brands to boycott Google until the company can guarantee ads on YouTube won't appear next to extremist content. A Google spokesperson told Business Insider the company does not comment on individual advertisers' decisions. However, Google did provide a statement with regards to brand safety generally on YouTube:  "We have strict guidelines that define where Google ads should appear, and in the vast majority of cases, our policies work as intended, protecting users and advertisers from harmful or inappropriate content. We accept that we don't always get it right, and that sometimes, ads appear where they should not. We're committed to doing better, and will make changes to our policies and brand controls for advertisers." At The Guardian's Changing Media Summit in London on Wednesday, WPP ad agency The&Partnership's founder Johnny Hornby said brands should set a deadline by which Google could guarantee these kinds of brand safety incidents do not happen again — or else they should all pull their spend.  "They need to act quickly, like now, and make a promise to invest a proper amount of money against a deadline. We need to say that we won't sit on another panel in Cannes and have this same discussion," he said, referring to the global advertising event that takes place in the south of France in June. "These are not organizations that don't have the money to put software in place. They have software that allows them to take money from advertisers and put videos on Jihadi sites. Use the same money to stop it. They have the financial might to do a lot more about this than simply going to conferences and recognizing these are issues." Earlier this month, WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell slammed Google — as he shared a stage with the search giant's UK managing director — saying the company needed to "step up and take responsibility" for the content posted to its platforms.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Get Free Money From Google By Answering Quick Surveys It is a truth universally acknowledged that a search engine in possession of a good fortune must be in want of more data. If you want to earn some extra money (in the form of Google Play Credit), Google will give you some in exchange for answering a few occasional survey questions. The Google Opinion Rewards app periodically gives you surveys consisting of a few simple questions. Most are based around your shopping habits and come from market researchers. If you’d like to know how your data will be used, you can read Google’s FAQ on the subject uses here. The rewards you get won’t pay your bills or anything, but each survey rewards anywhere from ten cents to a dollar or so for a few seconds of your time. It seems small, but it can add up fast—and when it does, and you can get free movie rentals or buy a couple games on the Play Store. Google Play credit even works on in-app purchases, so you can buy Pokéballs or comic books. All for passing a few seconds of time when you’re bored waiting in line at the grocery store. To get started, download the Google Opinion Rewards app. The first time you launch it, the app will ask you a series of demographic questions. Once you’re finished with those, you can wait for new surveys to show up. You’ll usually see them when you get a notification like the one below. When you get the notification, tap on it. Most surveys begin with an explanation of how this specific data is used. Tap “OK, got it.” Next, you’ll see a set of questions. These differ from one survey to another, and in some cases you may get some questions that are used to verify your honesty. For example, if you’ve recently visited a store, Google may ask you which of five stores you’ve been to. If you answer dishonestly, the survey will be cut short and you’ll receive a lower reward than if you answered correctly.   Once you’ve finished answering all your questions, you’ll see how much credit you receive as a reward. Longer surveys tend to get more money, and honest answers (at least as far as Google is able to confirm them) get higher rewards than choosing answers randomly. If you want to make extra certain that you don’t miss a survey, you can enable a notification sound. Normally, survey notifications are silent, but the sound (or vibration, if you keep your phone on silent) can give you a nudge so you don’t miss it. The surveys do expire, so the notifications can help make sure you don’t miss something. To turn notifications on, open the app and tap the menu icon in the top right. Then, tap Settings.   On the settings page, enable the “Notification sounds” toggle. Once everything is set up, all you have to do is wait for surveys to hit your phone. According to the product manager at Google for the app, the best way to get more surveys is to answer honestly and respond to surveys quickly. You’ll also get more surveys the more you get out of your house. Some stores will give you a survey every time you visit (usually a day or so later). Of course, you don’t need to upend your routine just for a quarter from Google, but if you stay at home all the time, you probably won’t see many surveys. It should also go without saying that if you want to keep your data as private as possible, this app isn’t for you. Google will use this data to customize ads for you, on top of third-party marketing companies using it for analyzing your shopping habits. As long as you’re comfortable with that, enjoy your free money. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (3 REPLIES) Got Feedback?

This will stop background tabs from consuming a ‘third of Chrome's power usage on desktop’ and boost battery life of laptops, the firm says. Starting in version 57, Chrome will throttle background tabs that are using excessive power in order to limit the average CPU load to one percent. The new update will automatically minimize tabs the API deems to be in the background unless they need to run at full capacity THROTTLING TABS  Google noted that background tabs consume a third third of Chrome's power usage on desktop.  Now with version 57, Chrome will throttle background tabs to save power. This will limit the average CPU to 1%. 'In the long-term, the ideal is for background tabs to be fully suspended and instead rely on new APIs for service workers to do work in the background,' Google shared. The firm said this method will lead to 25% fewer busy background tabs. The new update will automatically minimize tabs the API deems to be in the background unless they need to run at full capacity – this excludes those playing music or maintaining real-time connections. ‘Efficient power usage is an important aspect of speed, one of Chrome’s key pillars,’ Alexander Timin, software engineer and power save at Google, shared in a blog post. ‘To prolong battery life, Chrome should minimize power impact from things users can’t see. ' 'This includes background tabs, which consume a third of Chrome's power usage on desktop.’ Although Google has not revealed how much battery life will be saved using the new method, it has suggested that the throttling mechanism will lead to 25% fewer busy background tabs. ‘In the long-term, the ideal is for background tabs to be fully suspended and instead rely on new APIs for service workers to do work in the background,’ wrote Timin. ‘Chrome will continue to take steps in this direction to prolong users' battery life, while still enabling all the same experiences developers can build today.

Share this article Share 11 shares The new update comes after Microsoft uncovered evidence that Chrome was found to drain laptop batteries. In June 2016, Google’s rival conducted a series of tests that streamed the same video on four unplugged, identical laptops, each on a different browser. This excludes tabs playing music or ones that maintain real-time connections. Although Google has not revealed how much battery life will be saved using the new method, it has suggested that the throttling mechanism will lead to 25% fewer busy background tabs The browsers tested were Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Opera. The results showed that Google Chrome was the worst on the battery, with the laptop only lasting four hours and 19 minutes. The laptop using Mozilla Firefox lasted five hours and nine minutes, while Opera lasted six hours and 18 minutes. WEB BROWSER POPULARITY   Chrome: 58.53% Internet Explorer: 11.68% Firefox: 11.68% Microsoft Edge: 5.55% Safari: 3.48%  Source: NetMarketShare Opera has a specific power saving mode, which recognizes when your laptop is not charging and reduced background activity such as plug-ins. However, the laptop running Microsoft Edge lasted the longest, at seven hours and 22 minutes - 70 per cent longer than Google Chrome. While this does suggest that Microsoft's browser might be kinder to your battery, it should be noted that Google Chrome has additional features and browser extensions that Edge does not. Despite these findings, a spokesperson for Google told MailOnline: 'We've made significant improvements to power consumption in the past few releases, and it’s an area of continued focus and investment. 'Since the beginning of the year, we’ve made a 33% improvement in video playback GPU/CPU power consumption on Windows 10. 'And by Chrome 53, we feel confident that we’ll be at parity with other browsers in terms of power consumption for the majority of video playback on the internet.'   Read more: Market share for mobile, browsers, operating systems and search engines | NetMarketShare Chromium Blog: Reducing power consumption for background tabs Share or comment on this article e-mail 11 shares Most watched News videos Terrifying video of 737 pilot fighting strong winds to land airliner No handshake for Merkel!

As implied during the announcement of Assistant’s expansion, it is not coming to tablets. Additionally, Google’s Assistant website has been updated with tips, as well information about which commands work on each platform. Last month, Google only made reference to Assistant soon coming to phones. In a statement today to Android Police, the company explicitly notes that the current rollout “does not include tablets.” The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play Services, this does not include tablets. This omission is strange given how Screen search has long worked on the larger form factor.  One doesn’t expect the interface to be too varied, with Now on Tap only appearing as a phone-sized slide-up window at the bottom of the screen. It’s not immediately clear what the obstacle to bringing Assistant to tablets is, unless a more optimized experience is being worked on. With Google Assistant now available in four platforms following the rollout of Android Wear 2.0, it is quite confusing what voice commands will work. Google has since updated its official Assistant site with a useful ‘What can it do’ section. Broken down by category, each card features icons for phones, Home, and Wear to note where each command will work. Hopefully, feature parity is coming sooner than later.

The newest addition to Street View allows for users to explore the Vanuatuan island of Ambrym. Located thousands of miles east of Australia, the country of Vanuatu is an archipelago of 80 tiny islands. The 360-degree tour of Ambrym takes you through the jungle, inside villages, along a black sand beach and inside Marum Carter where the awe-inspiring lava lake can be seen. According to Google, the lake is "roughly the size of two football fields." "Standing at the edge and feeling the heat lick your skin is phenomenal," said explorer Chris Horsley.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google responds as Nexus 6 users get an unusual downgrade OTA from Android 7.1 By John Hoff - March 16, 2017 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter This is a bad day for some Nexus 6 owners, and this after the long wait for them to get to Android 7.1.1. The Nexus 6 is right along the edge of Google’s supported timeline, so the update to Android Nougat from Marshmallow was probably the last official bump up for the Motorola-made Nexus phablet. But after the long wait to finally get to Android 7.1.1, some Nexus 6 users are reporting that they’ve gotten an over-the-air update that brought their system back down to Android 7.0. Google’s response is of no help as well. Nexus 6 owners waited around four months to get the update to Android 7.0, and then waited until January to get Android 7.1.1. But that update came with some in-call audio issues, and it broke Android Pay. So the fix for that arrived a few days ago, and then this happens: a downgrade OTA arrives to some users, bringing their systems back to Android 7.0 – with the result being that their installed apps now continually crashed. Of course. Google’s official response was through a community manager who responded to the Reddit thread. It’s not good. Here is the quote: “There was a recent OTA update for Android 7.0 that is causing confusion for some Nexus 6 users. For those of you that want to guarantee future OTA updates, you will need to get back on the 7.0 supported track. If you are experiencing issues after accepting the 7.0 update, please factory reset your device to help resolve any problems. For any Nexus 6 users that want to continue flashing/sideloading future builds, you can stay on 7.1.1 and continue to do so.” So basically, these users are getting shrug and an advice to do a factory reset because they would not be able to get back on Android 7.1.1 if they don’t stay with the current OTA. Nicely done, Google. Stay classy.

By Michael Simon Staff Writer, Greenbot | Mar 16, 2017 1:36 PM PT Credit: Michael Simon More like this Everything we think we know about the LG G6 Hands on with the LG G6: A nice phone, but not especially innovative MWC 17: What's coming, what's not, and what we really want to see Video Hands on: TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 smartwatch Update, 1:30 PM: Sprint has released its own pricing and availability for the LG G6. This article has been updated to reflect the news. LG’S G6 was easily the hottest phone to come out of MWC, but the company was tight-lipped about when it was releasing and how much it would cost. With pre-orders set to begin tomorrow, however, we have a clearer picture of LG’s plans for its launch. First the good news: Anyone who orders a G6 before April 30 will be able to get a free Google Home, effectively saving $130. That’s a pretty sweet launch deal, even if you already have a Google Home. We hear they make great gifts, and they’re specifically made for you to have multiple Home units scattered around the house. But while most new phones have a set price across all retailers and carriers, the G6 will cost a little more or less depending on where you buy it. T-Mobile customers have it easiest. The phone will run you $650 (or $26 down, with 24 payments of $26, if you prefer), and will launch on April 7. Verizon customers will get their G6 a week earlier on March 30, but will have to pay slightly more for the privilege, $28 a month for 24 months, or $672. But wait there’s more! Customers who open a new line, device payment plan, and choose the Verizon Unlimited plan will also get a free LG 43-inch Smart TV worth $349. Couple that with the Google Home offer and you’re getting $479 in free stuff, which sort of lowers the price to just $193. AT&T’s offer is even more confusing still. Launching on April 7, the phone will cost $24 a month for 30 months under the AT&T Next program for a full cost of $720. However, you’ll also get a second LG G6 for free when you add another line. Those payments will also be spread out over 30 months, but AT&T will be paying them for you (unless you cancel the contract, at which point you’ll be responsible for the remaining balance). And finally, you’ll be able to purchase an LG Watch Sport for just $50 with a two-year contract. Though to be fair, that deal applies to any LG phone purchase and will still cost you an extra $240 when you factor in the $10-a-month fee. Sprint will also begin selling the G6 on April 7, but it will cost $708 on that network ($29.50 a month for 2 years). Along with the free Google Home, Sprint is also offering customers the a free 49-inch LG TV valued at $350. Notable, the phone is the first High-Performance User Equipment-capable device on Sprint’s network, which could account for the extra cost. Preorders for the phone are due to start Friday, March 17 across all carriers. G whiz: This is one of the reasons we love the Pixel so much: simplicity. LG’s pricing for the G6 is so confusing, the company might end up losing customers with this strategy. There is precious little time between its launch and the upcoming Galaxy S8, so if they don’t sell as many units as they can over the next few weeks, all those G6s might end up collecting dust on store shelves.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Mar 16, 2017 at 11:31AM Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had a surprise hit on its hand with the Echo smart speaker. After releasing it exclusively to Prime members in late 2014, the device proved so popular that Amazon was able to quickly open orders to everyone in the U.S. by the following summer. On Christmas Eve of 2015, the Echo was one of the top five items ordered, according to Amazon's annual holiday press release. Last year, Echo device sales climbed nine times compared to 2015's holiday season. That's despite the November introduction of Google Home, a competing smart speaker from the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary. During Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney suggested Echo devices, powered by the virtual assistant Alexa, outsold Google Home 10-to-1 in the quarter. However, Mahaney is changing his tune after conducting a more in-depth survey. "Home's awareness and installed base could be much closer to Alexa -- with a brand awareness in the U.S. 80% that of Alexa and an installed base that may be close to a third that of Alexa," he recently wrote in a note.   It looks like Google Home is quickly catching up to Amazon's Echo. Image source: Google. Google plans to keep investing in Google Home Google plans to keep making Google Home a better device by improving its search capabilities and functionality. "We are going to invest a lot in it over 2017," Google CEO Sundar Pichai told investors on Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call. "I think there is a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users. And this is the core area where we've invested in for the very long term," he added. Google intends to leverage its massive Android platform to continue improving Google Assistant, the artificial intelligence (AI) behind Google Home. At least 200 million devices will have access to the voice assistant, which will provide Google with a lot more opportunities to learn exactly what people are looking for when they say, "OK, Google." Google will also have to improve Google Home's capabilities. The device currently has around 80 Actions, which is nothing compared to the 10,000-plus functionalities available with Alexa. To that end, Google launched the Actions on Google developer kit in December. Strategy Analytics estimates Google will sell 1 million Google Home devices by midyear. That still trails Amazon's sales by a significant margin. The research group estimates Amazon sold 6.3 million Echo devices last year, and that should go up meaningfully in 2017. Mahaney estimates Amazon will sell 60 million Echo devices by 2020, bringing the install base to 128 million. Google still doesn't know how to monetize voice search While Google Home sales are improving relative to Amazon Echo, it's not clear device sales will follow a similar path. Google Home lacks one of the key functionalities of Amazon's devices: the ability to easily shop on Amazon. Seventeen percent of Echo owners use Alexa to place orders on Amazon, according to Mahaney's survey. As the number of devices in use grows, Mahaney expects the amount of shopping done via Alexa on Amazon to grow as well. By 2020, sales through the voice assistant could reach $5 billion, according to the analyst's estimate. Google doesn't even have a business model for monetizing Google Home beyond hardware sales. Search and display ads don't work very well on a device with no display. Moreover, Google doesn't offer a compelling differentiating factor for consumers to pick its device over another smart speaker. Comparatively, Amazon Prime members, of which there's a rapidly growing number, have lots of reasons to pick the Echo, like easy access to ordering things on Amazon or inexpensive use of Amazon Music Unlimited. As such, Amazon is poised to win the long-term competition even if Google Home is catching up in the short term.

Fast-forward a couple of weeks and one other detail of the rollout has been revealed. Google Assistant will not be coming to tablets, even if they’re running Marshmallow or Nougat. Google confirmed this to the folks at Android Police, saying, “The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play Services, this does not include tablets.” This news makes sense if you go back and look at Google’s original announcement of the expanded Assistant availability, which specifically mentions Android phones several times. And while there aren’t exactly a lot of Android tablets out there, it’s still kind of a bummer for the Android-powered slates that are floating around out there that they won’t be getting Assistant, at least not any time soon. Are you currently using an Android tablet? If so, which one?

Enter Google with its newest app, Family Link, an app that attempts to make the job of parenting easier, especially as it relates to managing how much time one’s children spend staring at computer screens. Essentially, the app allows parents to create special child-safe Google accounts. In turn, this allows parents to manage what apps their children can download from the Google Play Store, track how much time their kids are spending with a particular app, as well as remotely lock a device when it’s time for their child to do something else. Unfortunately, Canadian families will have to wait to try the app (much to the relief of rebellious teens across the country). Family Link is currently in early access, with Google testing the app with the aid of a small subsection U.S.-based users. Only families with children under the age of 13 can enroll to help Google work out any bugs and additional functionality. Moreover, Family Link is currently only compatible with Android devices running 7.0 and above, as well as a small selection of 6.1-based devices. Based on the app’s FAQ, however, it appears Google plans to release an iOS version of Family Link sometime in the future.

Comments Pingback: Google’s Family Link app gives parents a better way to manage their children’s device time | Daily Update() Shawn Armour Apple needs to do this. The app portion they do, but device management they don’t. And no 3rd party app does it well either. Brad Fortin Apple’s already got Restrictions on iOS. Do you mean they need to improve it? Unorthodox This is nice. If only Nougat ran on Nexus 7’s. Currently I’m an avid user of Dinner Time, and the kids (6yo) finally figured out that it is me who controls it, but surprisingly they were OK with that and even found it amusing.

Gartner estimates CarPlay will be in 37 million vehicles by 2020. TECHNOLOGY Apple, Google increasingly part of your car’s infotainment system Add to ... Peter Nowak Special to The Globe and Mail Published Thursday, Mar. 16, 2017 12:41PM EDT Last updated Thursday, Mar. 16, 2017 12:48PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print First they conquered smartphones, now Apple and Google want to horn in on the software that runs cars. Their forays started in earnest in 2016, but the two technology giants are stepping on the figurative gas with their efforts this year. Both Apple and Google are now incorporating CarPlay and Android Auto, the software systems that respectively replicate iPhone and Android device interfaces on dashboards, into vehicles from every major car manufacturer. More than 200 models from 2016 and 2017 either already support each system or will later this year, with many offering both. Aftermarket stereo makers including Pioneer, Kenwood and Sony are also incorporating CarPlay and Android Auto into their products. The partnerships with the tech companies are uncharacteristic for auto makers, who have traditionally kept their software development and innovation in-house. Consumer demand and technology usage trends, however, are forcing them to open up to the Silicon Valley giants. “People want to be able to run the same apps they have on their smartphones,” says Werner Goertz, personal technologies research director at analysis firm Gartner. “Auto makers are wise not to ignore that.” CarPlay and Android Auto diffusion is expected to spread quickly as a result. Gartner estimates CarPlay will be in 37 million vehicles by 2020, while Android Auto will be in 40 million. Many vehicles, such as the 2017 Audi A7 and the 2017 Ford Explorer, for example, will have the capability to accommodate both. In each case, Apple and Google are engineering simplified versions of their phone operating systems to work with the specialized controls found in different car models. While the in-vehicle interfaces usually look and feel like iOS or Android displays, apps are controlled using dashboard or steering-wheel knobs and buttons, as well as the main console touch-screens or touch-pads. Drivers and passengers can thus easily play music through the Spotify app or check the five-day forecast in The Weather Network app, for example, without having to touch or even look at their phones. So far, most cars have required users to connect their devices with cables, but both CarPlay and Android Auto are increasingly going wireless. Just as on phones, the competing systems also boast different advantages over one another. Apple is offering Siri voice control of various functions, including music apps and message reading and sending, while Android is delivering better navigation through Google Maps. Google also plans to add voice control to Android Auto this year through its Google Assistant, which is found on its phones and Home speakers. The company is looking for deeper voice control integration, however, by extending it to functions such as starting the car and locking the doors. Hyundai showed off some of these advanced features at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last January. Users will be able to tell their Android phone, for example, to start their Santa Fe or Sonata and set the interior to a certain temperature while they’re still inside their home. Both Apple and Google are expected to announce further CarPlay and Android Auto features at their coming developer conferences in San Francisco, happening in June and May, respectively. For the car makers, joining with the tech companies is a case of if-you-can’t-beat-them-join-them. “It comes down to where the expertise is,” says Carole Wilson, marketing manager for Lincoln. “It’s also about not creating something that doesn’t work with everything. Where partnerships make sense, we look at them.” Car makers’ willingness to team with Apple and Google doesn’t necessarily mean they’re ceding full future control of the software functions to the tech giants. Many are still working with app makers themselves to incorporate the services that consumers want more directly, which can yield several benefits. Direct deals would mean that manufacturers, and not the tech companies, can control which apps work in their vehicles. With CarPlay and Android Auto, Apple and Google control the pipeline by deciding which apps are allowed. Car companies can also get better access to the data generated by users through working with app makers directly. With data being the all-valuable resource of the Internet era, it’s a currency many manufacturers would rather not cede to Apple and Google as cars becoming increasingly connected. “Car makers are employing an all-of-the-above strategy,” Mr. Goertz says. As far as final software strategies go, “they haven’t made up their minds yet.” Report Typo/Error Follow Peter Nowak on Twitter: @peternowak   More Related to this Story SOUND SYSTEMS Audio advances put a concert in your car Security With increased computerization comes growing fear of hacking into cars Technology Today’s bells and whistles can shock even the most tech-savvy motorists Topics Google Inc.

The technology giant launched the voice-activated device in the US last October but is yet to extend its release outside of the country. But a cryptic invitation sent out to members of the UK press suggests a product launch taking place at the end of March could be for the much anticipated device.  Scroll down for video  Google Home (pictured) could finally be coming to the UK, if hints within a cryptic product launch announced by the search engine are to be believed. The smart speaker is the main rival to Amazon Echo, which arrived in the country last year The invite, for an event dated March 28, asks journalists to 'Please join us for some exciting announcements.' It also says the event will be an opportunity for reporters to 'meet the newest members of our family,' which many are interpreting as a reference to Google Home. Google is yet to announce the official date or UK price for the smart hub. But it has previously confirmed Home will go on sale in the UK during the 'second quarter' of this year, meaning it will be released before the end of June. 'We're in the Home stretch; Google Home is coming to the UK soon, stay tuned for more,' the tech firm said in a tweet. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Is Netflix working on mobile-friendly content?

Share this article Share The race to create a smart home assistant has already seen a range of virtual assistants released, from Apple's Siri to Amazon's Alexa and Facebook's chatbots.  Like Amazon Echo, which arrived in the UK last year, Google Home is an artificially intelligent speaker that responds to voice commands and can answer queries as well as control other internet-enabled appliances around the home. Google's Home is the firm's latest AI move after introducing its smart assistant in the new Pixel handsets at the end of last year.  The Google Home speaker costs $130 (£105), while Amazon's smart speaker is available in two versions - the full sized $180 (£145) Echo shown here, and a smaller, $50 (£40) version called the Echo Dot.  Google has confirmed that Google Home will go on sale in the UK during the 'second quarter' of this year, meaning it will be released before the end of June. They announced the release of Home in the UK in a tweet (pictured) Both devices use search engines to answer questions. Amazon Echo relies on Microsoft's Bing search engine and Wikipedia, while Google Home uses the company's own Google Search. Both Home and Echo are continually listening for commands, though Google and Amazon say nothing gets passed back to them until the speakers hear a keyword — 'OK, Google' for Home and 'Alexa' for Echo. Google's Assistant software is also able to answer follow-up questions on the same topic, in a near-conversation style, but Echo as yet can not. The Home speaker will give you the time, weather, estimated commute, the news and upcoming calendar appointments.  AMAZON ECHO VS GOOGLE HOME  Google's $130 (£105) Home speaker is triggered by the phrase 'Hey Google' while Amazon's Echo uses 'Alexa'. Amazon's smart speaker is available in two versions - the full sized $180 (£145) Echo shown here, and a smaller, $50 (£40) version called the Echo Dot.  Amazon Echo relies on Microsoft's Bing search engine and Wikipedia, while Google Home uses the company's own Google Search.  Google Home AI speaker (left) is triggered by the phrase 'Hey Google' .

However, Amazon's Alexa software has a wider range of skills on offer that enable it to link up with and control more third-party devices around the home. At the unveiling of Home in May last year, Google boss Sundar Pichai said: 'We think of the assistant as an ambient experience that goes across devices - this is more than just phones, it will be on devices they wear, in their car and in their living rooms.'  The leading tech companies are all competing to assist consumers in their online activities such as shopping, since that gives the companies a better chance of selling advertising or other services. Home-based systems like the Echo are taking on more importance with the advent of improved voice technology, according to Julie Ask, an analyst at Forrester Research.

Ads for the Guardian’s membership scheme are understood to have been placed alongside a range of extremist material after an agency acting on the media group’s behalf used Google’s AdX ad exchange. David Pemsel, the Guardian’s chief executive, wrote to Google to say that it was “completely unacceptable” for its advertising to be misused in this way. He said the Guardian would be withdrawing its advertising until Google can “provide guarantees that this ad misplacement via Google and YouTube will not happen in the future”. The content included YouTube videos of American white nationalists, a hate preacher banned in the UK and a controversial Islamist preacher. The use of programmatic trading, which automates the process of buying and selling advertising online , is becoming increasingly controversial amid concerns that it both hurts media revenues and supports extremist material. Earlier this week, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport held a private ministerial meeting with news publishers and technology platforms to discuss the issue of fake news and the programmatic environment which supports it. The Guardian’s problem is understood to have arisen through the use of AdX, Google’s DoubleClick Ad Exchange Service, which uses programmatic trading. In his letter to Matt Brittin, Google’s European president, Pemsel referred to the fact the Guardian’s membership scheme was partly launched to diversify revenues away from an ad market increasingly dominated by technology groups. Google, with YouTube and its DoubleClick ad service, as well as Facebook account for close to 85% of digital ad spend. “The decision by the Guardian to blacklist YouTube will have financial implications for the Guardian in terms of the recruitment of members to fund our journalism,” wrote Pemsel. “Given the dominance of Google, DoubleClick and YouTube in the digital economy, many brands feel that it is essential to place advertising on your platform. It is therefore vital that Google, DoubleClick and YouTube uphold the highest standards in terms of openness, transparency, and measures to avoid advertising fraud and misplacement in the future. It is very clear that this is not the case at the moment.” Pemsel urged other brands to blacklist the Google-owned companies until “guarantees that advertising placed on YouTube will not sit next to extremist content in the future” can be provided. At the Guardian’s Changing Media Summit this week, Johnny Hornby, founder of the ad group The&Partnership, said of the current market: “Far too little is being done to make a dent in the billions our clients are losing to fraudsters – let alone the reputational damage caused by the inadequate brand safety policies of major platforms like Google, YouTube and Facebook. “It should be within our gift as the clients who invest the money, and as the media agencies who recommend where to spend it, to simply agree to withdraw media spend from environments where we cannot guarantee safety for our clients’ brands.” Following the Guardian action, Google and YouTube promised to make significant changes to its policies to deal with the problem. A spokesman said: “We have strict guidelines that define where Google ads should appear, and in the vast majority of cases, our policies work as intended, protecting users and advertisers from harmful or inappropriate content. “We accept that we don’t always get it right, and that sometimes, ads appear where they should not. We’re committed to doing better, and will make changes to our policies and brand controls for advertisers.” Topics The Guardian Advertising National newspapers Newspapers Newspapers & magazines Google news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Google ad controversy: what the row is all about What is programmatic advertising, how does it work and why did big brands appear next to inappropriate material?

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Mobile Phones Google may have a larger third phone codenamed taimen in the works Mobile Phones Google may have a larger third phone codenamed taimen in the works By Bindu Nair - Mar 16, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Google has so far confirmed very little about its upcoming pair of flagship Pixel phones other than that it’ll arrive later this year. Now a pair of reports have revealed possible codenames and a third device in the works. Android Police claims that the next Pixel smartphones have been codenamed muskie and walleye. This is in keeping with the fish theme it’s got going over the past few years such as hammerhead for the Nexus 5 and shamu for the Nexus 6. Now Droid Life is reporting that there’s a third Google device being developed under the name taimen. The moniker refers to a very large fish in the salmon/trout family. This is a significant point, since a source asserts that the handset is bigger than muskie and walleye. Also Read: Reliance Jio, Google working on low-cost 4G handset The prediction makes sense when considering the fact that the 6-inch Nexus 6 was named after a big killer whale. Insiders say that taimen is a phone and not a tablet or 2-in-1. It also appears to be independent of the Pixel line. This suggests that it’s a separate product, perhaps the first member of an entirely new series. As for the Pixel 2, Google has officially stated that there is no cheaper variant of the handset being developed. The denial came after a couple of reports emerged of a more affordable model that would help capture the mid-range market sector the premium Pixel could not target. Speculation till date suggests that the Pixel 2 will boast of improved cameras which might perform better in low-light conditions. There are also whispers of Google fitting it with water resistance, a feature sorely missed in the original.

This solves the problem increasingly faced by parents, who want to let their kids have smartphones, but don’t want their kids to use them all day, every day with no limits. One of the many and varied problems parents face these days is keeping an eye on their children’s smartphone usage. This can be a tricky issue, especially as few parents want to spy on their kids Should Parents Spy On Their Kids? [MUO Debates] Should Parents Spy On Their Kids? [MUO Debates] Do you spy on your kids? If so, why? If not, why not? This is the question at hand today. These are the questions that we're going to explore in this debate. Read More . Hopefully, Google’s new app, called Family Link, provides a sensible solution. How Family Link Helps Parents In essence Family Link lets you maintain some level of control over your child’s phone. You simply download Family Link on your phone, and use it to create a Google account for your child. You then sign into it on their phone, leaving you free to control your kid’s smartphone usage. Using Family Link you can manage the apps your kid can use by approving or blocking attempted downloads from the Google Play Store. You can keep an eye on screen time by tracking how long they spend using their phone, and even set daily limits. And you can set a device bedtime which will remotely lock the phone at certain times of the day. There are some caveats to consider before using Family Link. For starters, your kid will need an Android handset running on Nougat (7.0) 7 Reasons You'll Want to Upgrade to Android Nougat 7 Reasons You'll Want to Upgrade to Android Nougat If you're thinking about making the jump to Android 7.0 Nougat, maybe these features could convince you. Read More or newer. Secondly, Family Link isn’t yet universally available, with parents in the U.S. currently being asked to request an invite to the Family Link early access program. Smartphones Aren’t Inherently Evil Family Link is a fantastic idea. After all, smartphones aren’t inherently bad for kids, as long as they’re not addicted to using them or engaging in nefarious activities. The solution is to have a responsible adult controlling their usage, and that’s exactly what Family Link allows. Does your child own a smartphone? Have you put any limits in place as to what they can do on it and how long they can spend on it? What do you think of Google’s Family Link app? Are you likely to install it on your kid’s phone?

DeepMind says the published study has flaws By Matt Burgess 2 days ago By Matt Burgess Thursday 16 March 2017 Getty Images / Christopher Furlong Google's DeepMind has been accused of having a "special relationship" with the NHS in order to access patient data for use in its Streams app. ADVERTISEMENT This is not the first time criticisms have been raised about the deal, announced in 2015, but they are the first to be presented in a research paper, written by the University of Cambridge's Julia Powles and Hal Hodson, a technology correspondent at The Economist. In particular, the open-access paper says the agreement "should serve as a cautionary tale". DeepMind hits back at criticism of its NHS data-sharing deal DeepMind hits back at criticism of its NHS data-sharing deal NHS 22 Nov 2016 READ NEXT Emma Watson takes legal action over leaked photos Emma Watson takes legal action over leaked photos By Liat Clark "Given it is a flagship deal in AI, innovation, and data-driven healthcare, it was worth probing further," Powles tells WIRED. "I actually think there has been a very narrow discussion about this. "It's easily characterised into privacy critics and big innovators. What we're trying to say is that innovation in this space requires a much more visionary approach from regulators, from companies, and the public, than we've seen with this deal." The paper claims there is little information about what is being done with patient data; too much data being transferred for the publicly stated needs; those people included in the data were not informed; regulators have not issued any comments; and other issues. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT We-Vibe accused of sex toy surveillance We-Vibe accused of sex toy surveillance By Alexandra Simon-Lewis It specifically discusses the data-sharing agreement agreed between the NHS and DeepMind in 2015. The deal allows the processing of patient data to be used in the Streams app, which monitors for signs of kidney problems and is being used in the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and other hospitals. A recent report claimed that the app is saving nurses 'two hours' per day. In response to the paper, Google-owned DeepMind and the Royal Free hospital have said there are errors in the work. "This paper completely misrepresents the reality of how the NHS uses technology to process data," the statement explains. "It makes a series of significant factual and analytical errors, assuming that this kind of data agreement is unprecedented". However, the pair has not publicly stated what these analytical errors are. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT You can now make encrypted video calls with Signal You can now make encrypted video calls with Signal By Matt Burgess Subscribe to WIRED Since the agreement was announced, it has been re-written. In fact, Powles says the original has been "torn-up and replaced". ADVERTISEMENT The detailed, 14,000 word paper says the original agreement "has suffered from a lack of clarity and openness" and the issue of privacy around the deal has been raised during the process. Since the app was unveiled, there have also been questions about how patient data is processed. Previously, DeepMind clashed with privacy and data protection experts over the issues with disagreements over the legal aspects. The mostly-silent centre of arguments is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which oversees data protection issues in the UK. The body has been investigating the DeepMind and NHS deal since initial complaints were made. The ICO confirmed to WIRED that its investigations into the sharing of patient information was close to finishing. "We continue to work with the National Data Guardian and have been in regular contact with the Royal Free and Deep Mind who have provided information about the development of the Streams app," the ICO said. "This has been subject to detailed review as part of our investigation.

Frustrated by recipes grossly understating the amount of time necessary for onions to turn brown and soft in a pan, he wrote a blog post for Slate in 2012 to correct the record. But recent developments prompted him to revisit the issue in a piece for Gizmodo headlined “Google's algorithm is lying to you about onions and blaming me for it.” He talked with Marketplace host Kai Ryssdal about what happened. Below is an edited transcript of their conversation. Kai Ryssdal: Tell me about caramelized onions, man, because honestly, it's probably one of the biggest lies in cooking, right? Tom Scocca: It is! About five years ago, I finally reached my boiling point about this fact. I was reading a recipe in the New York Times — and it wasn't even a recipe that I meant to cook. I think it was a recipe for some savory scones, but it said that if you chopped up your onions, and you threw them in a pan, and you cooked them for five minutes, and then you cooked it for five minutes more, you would have golden brown, sweet caramelized onions to put in your scones. And I said, “No, you won’t. You won't be anywhere near it.” [It takes] most of an hour, 45 minutes, an hour depending on how hard you do it. And I had seen things like this over and over again, so I wrote an article for Slate about it where I actually tried to cook caramelized onions as fast as I could and on high heat. I got it done in like 29 minutes. But it was miserable. You're just starting like crazy to get it done. So I wrote about this, about how all these recipes always lie about how long it's going to take. Ryssdal: Exactly. So, you write about it in Slate, and now here comes this piece in Gizmodo headlined “Google's algorithm is lying to you about onions and blaming me for it.” Tell me about that. Scocca: Right. So, I wrote the Slate piece, and it was actually sort of a success. It got the New York Times to change its approach to writing about onions. I kept hearing from people who had thought they were bad cooks and then learned that in fact they had just been following bad recipes. And so I put this down as a little bit of progress against the darkness of falsehood. Ryssdal: But then, you noticed — Scocca: Yeah. So, I read these articles that were coming out in the last week or two about how Google has this new feature that's supposed to give you the one true answer to a question you type in. Instead of just feeding you a list of things, it pops out in a big box and tells you what the one true answer is. And the problem is that people discovered that if you ask it if Barack Obama is planning a coup d'etat against the U.S. government, it says “Yes, he is.” If you ask it, “Is MSG poisonous,” it says, “It certainly is.” Because bad information that people passionately believe has a way of rising to the top. So, when I saw this, I thought about the onions again, and I thought about how this was a false thing that there was a lot of information about. So, I typed in “How long does it take to caramelize onions?” and I was shocked by what I got. Not only did it have the wrong information, but it had the wrong information because it was citing my piece. Ryssdal: Now, we should say, that in the days, what, week or so since this post was published, Google has in fact changed the search results, right? So, you've changed two things: You've changed the New York Times and you've changed Google. Scocca: Right. Unfortunately, it's not that it's not really that uplifting, because I am assuming that this required some manual intervention on their part. Because what happened was, its automated information sniffing system just went in, found this article that I guess people had pointed to as something about how long it takes to do this, and then it saw that at the top of the piece, it talks about taking five minutes, and then taking five minutes more, which should mean 10 minutes. But Google just said, “Oh, it takes five minutes.” So, a piece that was meant to debunk bad information ended up bunking it instead. Ryssdal: Boy, I've never heard that — “bunking it.” So, do you still deal with caramelized onions, or do you just skip recipes with caramelized onions in them? Scocca: I throw them in the Crock-Pot overnight. Ryssdal: Oh, that's so smart. Scocca: They become a little juicy, and you might need to dry them out in the pan a bit before you actually use them, but it's a lot faster. Ryssdal: Tom Scocca is a special projects desk guy at Gizmodo. Tom, thanks very much.

Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Cisco filed an amicus brief after a Pennsylvania court ruled that the company had to hand over the emails in response to an FBI warrant. Contrary to what a magistrate judge had decided, this is no Fourth Amendment privacy infringement search and seizure, the companies argued in the brief. As has been decided in earlier court cases, law enforcement agencies… …may not execute search warrants for property in foreign countries at all: Any warrant issued by a judicial officer in this country ‘would be a dead letter outside the United States’ [United States v Verdugo-Urquidez]. From the amicus brief: When a warrant seeks email content from a foreign data center, that invasion of privacy occurs outside the United States – in the place where the customers’ private communications are stored, and where they are accessed, and copied for the benefit of law enforcement, without the customer’s consent. According to the Register, the Feds are demanding the “contents of three separate Google ‘Gmail’ email accounts”, though the nature of the crime being investigated isn’t clear. Déjà vu? Déjà indeed. Last time, it was Microsoft the US government pulled the Heimlich maneuver on, trying over the course of years (and ultimately failing) to get the company to cough up private email stored on servers in a data center in Ireland. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More At the time, Microsoft general counsel and executive vice-president for legal and corporate affairs Brad Smith argued that in spite of the US having a warrant to secure the emails in a narcotics trafficking investigation, well-established case law holds that such search warrants can’t reach beyond US shores. In spite of the court refusing to hear an appeal from the government on that case in January, a Pennsylvania federal judge ruled in early February that Google had to turn over data from its overseas servers, arguing that the suspects’ data would be “searched” on US soil. Hence, there would be no problems with extraterritoriality with Google’s complying with the Stored Communications Act warrants. The tech companies wrote in their amicus brief that in Google’s case, handing over foreign data would be seen by “our sister nations” as an affront to their sovereignty. From the brief: Our sister nations clearly view US warrants directing service providers to access, copy, and transmit to the United States data stored on servers located within their territory as an extraterritorial act on the part of the US government. Indeed, they view this as an affront to their sovereignty in much the same way that physically conducting law enforcement activity on foreign soil would violate their sovereignty and territorial integrity. According to the companies, it’s up to Congress, not the courts, to decide whether the SCA applies overseas. The Register quoted a Google spokesman who said Google’s planning to fight: The magistrate in this case departed from precedent, and we plan to appeal the decision. We will continue to push back on over-broad warrants. This certainly isn’t the first time that Silicon Valley tech companies have chimed in to help each other out. It’s not hard to see why. They are, after all, in this together: if one of them is forced to hand over users’ private email, the precedent could be used to force any or all of them to do the same. When Microsoft was on the hot seat, defending email on its Irish servers, its challenge to the lawfulness of the warrant was supported by a deluge of support, with more than 75 civil liberties groups, technology companies, trade associations and computer scientists filing legal briefs in support of the company.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close The Associated Press This Thursday, Jan. 3, 2013, file photo shows Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.  (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) U.S. judge rejects Google email scanning settlement By Jonathan Stempel Reuters Mar 16, 2017 (…) This Thursday, Jan. 3, 2013, file photo shows Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.  (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) The Associated Press A federal judge rejected Google's proposed class-action settlement with non-Gmail users who said it illegally scanned their emails to Gmail users to create targeted advertising. In a decision on Wednesday night, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, Calif., said it was unclear that the accord, which provided no money for plaintiffs but up to $2.2 million in fees and expenses for their lawyers, would ensure Google's compliance with federal and state privacy laws. Koh called the proposed disclosure notice inadequate. She said this was because it did not clearly reveal any technical changes that Google would make, or that Google scans non-Gmail users' emails to create ads for Gmail users. The judge also said the notice did not make clear that Google could still extract data for the "dual purpose" of creating targeted ads and detecting spam and malware, and then use that data once emails went into storage after being transmitted. "In sum, based on the parties' current filings, the court cannot conclude that the settlement is fundamentally fair, adequate, and reasonable," Koh wrote. Google, a unit of Mountain View, Calif.-based Alphabet Inc., declined to comment. Koh distinguished the settlement from a similar accord with Yahoo Inc. that she said required more disclosures. Michael Sobol, a partner at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein representing the plaintiffs, in an interview said, "we will press on with the litigation, while exploring opportunities for a resolution consistent with the court's decision." He said this could include an end to the challenged scanning.

Compare pay of top St. Louis executives The named plaintiffs, Daniel Matera of New York and Susan Rashkis of San Francisco, had accused Google of violating the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act and California Invasion of Privacy Act through its scanning practices. Koh ruled six days after Google won preliminary approval from a different judge in her court of a separate $22.5 million settlement with businesses over internet ad placements. In that case, known as Google AdWords Litigation, businesses accused Google of placing their ads in obscure places such as error pages and undeveloped websites known as parked domains, causing them to overpay for the placements.

Time for publicly owned fiber optic internet!" Three years ago, Denis C. Theriault and I cowrote a story for the Mercury about Google Fiber. At the time, Google had just announced Portland as one of a handful of cities that might get its ultra-high speed internet. Despite Portland having already suffered a failed attempt at free, city-wide wifi (that plan was dead by 2007), as well as getting passed over once before by Google (in 2010), there was hope that this time it'd happen—that this time, Portland would be one of the cities to leave behind its outdated internet infrastructure and prepare itself for the future. That... did not happen. Portland never got Google Fiber. (You might've noticed.) It came down, naturally, to finances: Installing fiber is expensive, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, started to realize that maybe wiring a bunch of cities with fiber wasn't the most cost-effective plan they'd ever had. "Google’s retreat is all about the bottom line," Susan Crawford, author of Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age, wrote earlier this week in a Backchannel post titled "Google Fiber Was Doomed From the Start." "It wanted an unrealistic rate of return on basic infrastructure." This is what fiber optic cables look like on the inside! As Crawford points out, fiber is basic infrastructure. And basic infrastructure... ...requires long-term vision and patient capital — think horizons of 10 years or more, rather than two or three. In return, investments in basic infrastructure will pay steady, reliable returns until the sun explodes. And the spillovers from those investments in terms of economic growth and social justice for everyone in a community are routinely extraordinary. Think subway systems, railways, and telephone networks: Fiber optic internet access for everyone, and for every other form of infrastructure, is the most important recent addition to that list of physical networks. (Via.) Despite a federal court's common-sense decision that "broadband is as essential as the phone and power and should be available to all Americans," conservatives hate whenever someone points out that high-speed internet is as essential as the phone and power and should be available to all Americans. Maybe they hate it because it's so hard to argue against. Still, it's not like that argument is keeping conservatives from screwing over the public: Trump-appointed FCC chairman Ajit Pai is making it clear he means to get rid of the 2015 Open Internet Order, which, as former FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said at the time, made clear that "no one—whether government or corporate—should control free open access to the internet." Make no mistake: The direction the FCC is headed in—paired with Google quietly backing out of the room whenever anyone mentions fiber—isn't good news for anyone who relies on the internet. But the FCC hasn't ruined everything yet, and it's worth remembering that Google Fiber was hardly an ideal solution: Even if Portland had gotten fiber from Google, we would've been stuck dealing with Google. "Google Fiber, please find me a mutant who thinks I'm cute." A better solution is one that communities all over the country have found: Building and using their own, publicly owned broadband infrastructure. Back to Crawford: The only business model for fiber that will work to produce the competition, low prices, and world-class data transport we need — certainly in urban areas — is to get local governments involved in overseeing basic, street grid-like “dark” (passive, unlit with electronics) fiber available at a set, wholesale price to a zillion retail providers of access and services. (Via.) The longterm financial and social benefits of Portlanders having access to affordable, publicly owned, future-proofed internet are obvious enough I don't need to point them out. (Maybe just a bit less obvious: That with the rest of the world way ahead of us, it doesn't matter if there are current benefits—we're eventually going to need it.) It also seems like something that Portland—with its willful iconoclasm and spawning hordes of tech drones—is uniquely positioned to move forward on. Would Portland building its own, publicly owned fiber optic network be super expensive? Oh sweet jesus yes. And is such a thing easier said (by me) than done (by people who actually have to do it)? Totally. And are we already doing an awful job taking care of our existing basic infrastructure like—I don't know—roads? Why, yes. Here's a slide that was shown to Portland City Council this week, reflecting that nearly half of city roads are in poor or very poor shape. "Beep boop beep. Computer! Initiate pothole-filling machine!" But that doesn't make it any less important—and the longer we wait, the more we'll wish we'd started sooner.

COMMENT 'My colleagues are racist', 'My colleagues are idiots', 'Someone I work with has bed bugs', 'My job kills my soul' range from funny, to worryingly depressing Owen Gough UK workers are more likely to trust Google with their work worries than their colleagues. Common search queries, such as ‘My colleagues are racist’, ‘My colleagues are idiots’, ‘Someone I work with has bed bugs’, ‘My job kills my soul’ range from funny, to worryingly depressing. There are 2.4 million Google searches for the term ‘job search’ each year – that’s 273 an hour – and a significant peak in January, in which you can read more about on DPG’s blog. CIPD course provider, DPG Plc., analysed Google Autocomplete data to see if the search giant could shed any insight onto the matter. They discovered that a number of searches were things that could be discussed with HR departments, but we now trust Google in some instances more than our partner, so perhaps it is becoming natural to turn to Google for workplace issues. You can find more strange searches here A selection of further hi-res images are available. Despite initial results seeming light hearted, the majority of searches were extremely negative, suggesting an air of desperation in UK workplaces. Managing director at DPG Plc., Paul Drew, says, ‘Google has become first port of call for solving queries and embarrassing problems, but the trouble is that the advice out there is rarely as useful as it may seem, and it’s worrying that people aren’t confiding in their HR department when they have an issue. ‘HR departments are trained specifically for dealing with sensitive issues, so people should never feel that they can’t ask them for help. Unfortunately, the Google dependent world we live in can lead to HR being cut out of the equation. That’s when employees take matters into their own hands, with at best unhelpful results and at worst – a potential employment law issue. ‘For example, if you feel a colleague has a hygiene issue, you should never deal with it yourself. You can risk hurting the colleague’s feelings or even making them feel harassed. Instead, speak with your HR department and voice your concerns. They’ll be able to deal with it in a diplomatic way and by the book.’ Further reading on Google Why so many businesses are still confused by SEO Nominations are now open for the British Small Business Awards 2017, the leading event celebrating the brightest stars in the SME sector. Click here to enter, and make sure you get involved today using the hashtag #BSBAwards. Good luck!

Google is currently working on the upcoming Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, but a new report from Droid Life suggests that the company may also be developing a previously unknown third smartphone. A recent report noted that the upcoming 2017 Pixel devices were likely codenamed ‘muskie’ and ‘walleye’, and that a third device using the codename ‘taimen’ had been reported by multiple sources. One of the sources told Droid Life that the ‘taimen’ smartphone would feature a bigger screen than the Pixel XL. Hopefully Google will soon reveal if this mysterious third smartphone does indeed exist. Powered by ClickOnline.com READ MORE Visit the section home page here © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Fuchsia MacAree, the local illustrator Google commissioned to beautify what was until recently a boring grey warehouse building, drew inspiration for this particular mural by the concept of free cooling, or using cool outside air instead of energy-guzzling mechanical chillers to cool the computing equipment inside. The mural is painted over massive louvers through which outside air is sucked into the facility. The Dublin facility is one of two latest Google data centers to get large-scale artwork on their outside walls as part of the company’s Data Center Mural Project, started last year. With the project, Google declared war on boring data center walls, setting out to commission local artists in communities around the world where it’s built computing facilities to make the buildings more interesting than your typical server farm. MacAree “was inspired by how Ireland’s unique climate and fresh air, rather than mechanical cooling, regulates the temperature of Google’s data center,” Joe Kava, VP of Google Data Centers, wrote in a blog post. “She’s created a series of whimsical murals depicting a windy day in Dublin, including scenes from local landmarks like Grand Canal Square, Phoenix Park and Moore Street Market.” The largest of several murals illustrator Fuchsia MacAree painted on the walls of Google’s data center in Dublin (Photo: Google) The second of the two newly decorated data centers is in Council Bluffs, Iowa. There, painter Gary Kelley drew on the area’s history as an information hub for inspiration. A series of monotype images he painted on the facility’s walls catalogue that history, “from Lewis and Clark to today.” Painter Gary Kelley documented the area’s history as an information hub on the walls of Google’s data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa (Photo: Google) The Data Center Mural Project has now transformed the look of four Google data center sites. Artists in Mayes County, Oklahoma, and St. Ghislain, Belgium, painted murals on the company’s computing facilities in those communities.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Assistant isn’t coming to Android tablets Newsby Jimmy Westenberg3 days ago 10 491 34 About a month ago, Google first announced that its new Assistant, which first debuted on the Pixel and Pixel XL, would be rolling out to pretty much all Android phones running Marshmallow and higher. At the time of the announcement, the company was pretty careful about its wording. The announcement post read: Starting this week, the Google Assistant is coming to smartphones running Android 7.0 Nougat and Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Even though the company’s statement specifically mentioned smartphones, it wasn’t beyond the realm of possibility to think that Google could, if it really wanted to, bring Assistant to all Android devices running Marshmallow and higher – even Android tablets. Unfortunately for tablet users, that’s not going to happen, at least not right now. See also: Best Android tablets 5 days ago According to a statement given to Android Police, Google explains: The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play Services, this does not include tablets. That’s it, folks. You can stop tapping the home button on your Pixel C or Nexus 7 hoping to see anything other than Google Now on Tap. Does this statement mean that Assistant will never ever make its way to tablets? We’re not sure right now, but we do know Google has no plans to do so any time soon. Now, there is a workaround that lets you enable Assistant if you don’t mind editing your build.prop, which might be worth looking into if you really want Assistant on your tablet. Do you own an Android tablet? If so, are you upset that you won’t be getting Assistant any time soon? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

Designing the Disney Future facebook twitter google+ email reddit linkedin pinterest License License Gary S. Vasilash Shortly after he became president of what was then Google Self-Driving Cars, John Krafcik and I were talking design. At one point during the conversation, he said, "Doesn't it look like you just want to hug it?" He was talking about one of the Google self-driving vehicles. No, not the Lexus RX 450h outfitted with all manner of spinning, projecting, probing and otherwise slightly ominous-looking objects that makes it look like it would be, were it painted black, the Official Crossover of Bruce Wayne's Alter Ego. Krafcik was talking about what was then simply known as the "Google Car," that object that resembles the coconut-covered Hostess Sno Ball on wheels, a dome-like vehicle that is even too cute to be a character in a Pixar Cars movie, but would look right at home transporting people to Cinderella's Castle in the Magic Kingdom. Volkswagen Group recently revealed at the Geneva International Motor Show Sedric, its concept of what a four-place autonomous transport device might look like. Whereas the Google Car (I've yet to hear it referred to by anyone as the "Waymo Car") has a rounded theme, Sedric is more rectangular. As automotive designer and mobility enthusiast Dan Sturges might categorize it: Sedric is a COW—a container on wheels. And like a cow that we've come to know not through actual farms but via Gary Larson cartoons, Sedric is exceedingly benign in appearance, with rounded edges and corners and a front end that looks like it could be the Google Cars big androgynous sibling. Another family member, perhaps a cousin, would be Olli, the autonomous vehicle introduced last fall by Local Motors. It is like Sedric in not only its overall form, but also in its design as a multiple-person transporter. Olli uses IBM's Watson virtual agent. While that system is named after Thomas J. Watson, IBM's first CEO, it brings to mind Sherlock Holmes's sidekick, Dr. Watson, as portrayed in the 1940s series of movies by Nigel Bruce, a nonthreatening, avuncular character who would invariably get the job done. Pleasantness is essential in the space of advanced technology. When talking about Sedric and the ID Buzz and Buzz electric vehicles, Klaus Bischoff, head of Volkswagen Design, said, "We want to give the cars a more friendly appearance. They shouldn't be aggressive. We don't want to come up with grills that you fear the car will eat you up—no man-eaters." Bischoff continued, "We want to take this opportunity to harken back to a very friendly approach, a new design language for Volkswagen that also differs a lot from what our combustion engine cars are providing." "No man-eaters." While people tend to think of how autonomous vehicles will transform one's commute, that will probably only be the case if a person works at the rec center in a retirement community and lives on site or drives with a theme park. And that fact may go a long way toward explaining why purpose-designed/built autonomous vehicles have such a benign appearance. Realize that whether it is the aforementioned RX 450h that Waymo is using, the Ford Fusions that are decked out with sensor arrays at places like MCity in southeastern Michigan or the Volvo XC90s that Uber is running, all of these are vehicles that were conceived and produced without any consideration to being run in autonomous mode. Consequently they look like, well, regular vehicles. But as we have companies develop autonomous rides, they are doing so knowing full well that they have to make something that looks more befitting an amusement park than a public road. When Local Motors launched Olli in the public, it did so at National Harbor, Maryland, "a 350-acre resort destination." Or put another way, it showed how its vehicle works to the public in a private setting. Captivity is its natural environment. If this benign, huggable blobiness is what is going to become of automotive design language for the next couple of decades until the vehicles are fully integrated into the transportation system, then it is probably a good argument to start paying attention to the designs of major appliances as they may be the things that are far more edgy, literally and figuratively.

Unless you're a world traveler, there's a good chance you'll never make it to Vanuatu, an archipelago of 80 tiny islands located more than a thousand miles off the coast of Australia. But now, thanks to Google, anyone with a computer can explore the remote country's jungles, black sand beaches, and even peer inside an active volcano. "Starting today in Google Maps, we invite you to join us on a journey to the edge of one of the largest boiling lava lakes in the world on the Vanuatuan island of Ambrym," the Web giant wrote in a Wednesday blog post. To get the incredible images, Google partnered with explorers Geoff Mackley and Chris Horsley, who repelled 400 meters into the Marum crater with a Street View Trekker strapped on their backs that collected 360-degree imagery of "the molten lava lake, which is roughly the size of two football fields," Google said. In a statement, Mackley said standing at the edge of the volcano, feeling the heat on his skin, was a "phenomenal" experience. "You only realize how insignificant humans are when you're standing next to a giant lake of fiery boiling rock," he said. Google maps landmarks all over the world — from the Grand Canyon to Mt. Everest — but this is the first time the Web giant has taken its Street View technology beneath the Earth's surface. The tropical island of Ambrym is home to two active volcanic cones called Benbow and Marum as well as more than 7,000 people who have "learned to live in harmony with this beautiful yet deadly natural phenomena." Related Drone Captures Epic Footage of Iceland Volcano Eruption Drone Captures Epic Footage of Iceland Volcano Eruption Google spoke with a local village leader, Chief Moses, who explained that his people "believe that the volcanoes Marum and Benbow are devils… We believe that Benbo is the husband and Marum is the wife. Sometimes when they don't agree there's an eruption which means the spirit is angry so we sacrifice a pig or fawel to the volcano." Vanuatu in 2015 was hit by Cyclone Pam and natives have been rebuilding the country's infrastructure ever since. Now, "Chief Moses and his village are ready to welcome travelers back," Google wrote. "He believes making Vanuatu more accessible to the world is a key step in the island's recovery and ability to establish a sustainable economy and preserve its culture."

Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! This week I’m in Chicago on business and preparing for next week, where I’ll be at the first Devoxx US event, ever! I hope to see you there! Last week, I continued the Spring Tips series with a look at how to implement server-sent events using classic Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux in Spring Framework 5, due this summer. Last week, Pivotal and Google announced Kubo, the ability to run and manage Kubernetes, on top of BOSH, alongside Cloud Foundry. This means that it’s now possible to get support for both Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes deployments, supporting cloud-native applications and low-level container orchestration equally.

It was developed by the Cloud Foundry team (many of whom were former Googlers) to support deploying Cloud Foundry itself. It’s the package manager for services, not servers. It can be used to recreate entire distributed systems from the operating system up, with immutable infrastructure (as opposed to converged infrastructure options like Puppet or Chef). If you’re managing a large distributed system, you need something like this beneath your system. You can also deploy arbitrary other packages, like Apache JMeter in distributed mode. Also announced last week, Google’s CRE support and reliability engineers and Pivotal have tag-teamed to support and certify Pivotal Cloud Foundry running on Google Cloud. To appreciate why this is so important, it means that Pivotal Cloud Foundry - which is becoming more and more white-hot by the day — now bakes in Google’s best practices for site reliability engineering, as described here. Michael Gruczel put together a nice look at building REST APIs with Spring Boot in this German language post. I liked Stefan Pröll’s posts introducing using Hibernate Search and Spring Boot together. Not particularly related to Pivotal, I enjoyed this post from Eric Brewer - father of the CAP theorem — framing how CAP applies to Google’s Spanner database. I really enjoyed this JAX survey report detailing the frameworks in which people have the most interest. Spring MVC and Spring Boot take the top spots in their respective categories. Thanks so much, Java community! Check out this talk introducing Apache Geode by Spring Data for Apache Geode contributors John Blum and Luke Shannon. Couchbase developer advocate Laurent Doguin put together a nice look at testing Spring Data Couchbase applications with Test Containers and Spring. This Russian language post by Alexander Kosarev nicely introduces Spring Data repository method tricks. I liked Oracle senior application engineer Orlando L. Otero’s post on multi-version service discovery using Spring Cloud. this was a very short-n-sweet look at Spring Boot’s DevTools and live-reload support. Kevin Hooke put together a nice look at using Spring Data Redis to build a search endpoint over REST. John Thompson put together a nice look at using Spring Boot with Microsoft SQL Server. Oliver Antoine put together a nice look at integration testing Spring Data Cassandra applications. Check out the slides and code to our friend Nicolas Frankel’s talk, Spring Boot Under the Hood. This Tech Primer video on using Spring Data ElasticSearch seemed interesting. Iam Djalas looks at how to configure Spring Boot to talk to different databases using profiles. Auth0 has a nice post on configuring Spring Boot to work with a third-party JWT implementation. To our friends at Stormpath, congratulations on joining forces with Okta!

Android Police confirmed with Google that the Assistant is currently rolling out to Android phones only. "The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play Services, this does not include tablets," the company wrote. It's not clear why Google is making tablet owners wait Why the distinction? It's not at all clear. Google could be planning a different interface for tablets' bigger screens, but it didn't change a thing for the Assistant's predecessor, Now on Tap. It's also possible that Google is just trying to maintain a slow rollout for the Assistant — it took months for it to expand beyond the Pixel — but the company has more-or-less opened the floodgates by rolling it out to Android phones, which are far more popular than Android tablets. So it's not entirely evident why tablets, running the same OS, would be a different story. Google announced at the end of last month that the Google Assistant would begin rolling out to Marshmallow and Nougat phones in a number of English-speaking countries, and the update seemed to hit most phones sometime last week. The Assistant is a Siri-like interface that pulls together a number of features that Android devices have already been able to do, making them a little bit easier for users to access. Presumably, the Assistant will hit recent Android tablets eventually — there's just no word on when Google plans to make that happen.

Google will start shipping development kits for its Project Soli wireless gesture recognition technology later this year. Project Soli involves a millimeter-wave radar chip that can detect "very fine" gestures with fingers and hands. It can then be used for playing games using hand gestures on mobile devices, computers and electronics. The technology has the potential to get rid of controllers and input devices. Its biggest impact could be in virtual and augmented reality. When using VR headsets, users now need to hold controllers, but Project Soli could allow hand gesture movement to define how a user roams a virtual world. The chip is so tiny that Google has put it in devices as small as smartwatches. It was jointly developed by Google with Infineon, which has said the technology will be marketed by both companies later this year. An announcement about the development kit was made at the recent Game Developer Conference. The goal for the developer kit is to discover new uses for the technology. Initially, Google is targeting Project Soli at game control using hand gestures. A demo showed a user flicking fingers on a device containing the Project Soli chip, and the finger movement controlled a character running on a screen. The quicker the fingers flicked, the faster the character ran. By moving the hand up or down, the character could jump over trees. One group at the University of St. Andrews in the U.K. used the technology to recognize materials based on weight and other characteristics. For example, it could detect copper, plastic and other materials. Project Soli could be a transformative technology and used in applications beyond gaming, Aaron Cammarata, technical project lead at the Google Advanced Technology and Projects group (ATAP), said in a video posted on YouTube. The radar technology is highly reliable, and the response is quick because it uses millimeter-wave technology. Google ATAP is leading the project and works on technology that is then used in commercial products. One of its big flops was Project Ara, a modular smartphone that was scrapped by Google. ATAP also developed Tango, an augmented reality platform that is now part of Lenovo's Phab 2 Pro smartphone.  Later this year, Levi's will ship clothes with touch and gesture interactivity stitched into the fabric. That functionality was developed as part of Google ATAP's Project Jacquard. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Breaking the Internet Last year an unknown hacker unleashed a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack targeting U.S.-based Dyn, a company who provides DNS services for many Internet scale Web properties.  By focusing massive amounts of junk traffic from as many as 10 million compromised bots, the attack ultimately brought down such well-known sites as Twitter, Reddit, Netflix and Airbnb.  Think about that for a minute.  A single DDoS attack targeting a single company resulted in a day’s worth of absolute chaos and brought down several of the world’s largest Web properties.  So much for avoiding single points of failure. In one sense the attack wasn’t groundbreaking; DDoS attacks have been on the rise for years.  But two aspects of the attack bear mentioning.  First, the attack utilized compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices, as many as 10 million according to some reports.  That’s important because IoT devices are growing geometrically and are notoriously under-protected.  For example, what is the username for your webcam at home?  For far too many users the answer is “whatever they defaulted to out of the box,” providing fertile ground from which hackers can recruit the bots they need for their DDoS attacks. The second notable aspect was the sheer volume of traffic the attack generated.  The exact magnitude may never be precisely known, but estimates range as high as 1.2 terabits per second.  This is far beyond the capacity of most DDoS protections solutions.  If Netflix and Airbnb can fall to such DDoS attacks, what chance does the average site have?  Before you answer, consider that Deloitte is predicting that DDoS attacks will grow significantly in 2017, to more than 10 million discrete attacks, and that the size of the biggest attacks grew by 250 percent in the past year. The reality is that DDoS is a problem that is going to get worse – a lot worse – before it gets better.  It is worth thinking about how best to mitigate such attacks. Why High-Volume DDoS Attacks Are So Hard to Mitigate Fighting DDoS attacks requires two very different capabilities: intelligence and mitigation.  Intelligence is being able to spot the attacks in the first place.  Mitigation is doing something about it.  DDoS attacks can be stealthy, making common and seemingly innocuous requests of a company’s servers, but in such a high volume that the servers crumble under the load.  Security intelligence requires sophisticated software algorithms to analyze traffic in order to quickly and accurately identify attacks. Mitigation, on the other hand, is a fairly brute force operation.  It requires less intelligence, but very high throughput and fast switching times.  Mitigation in many ways is just a form of forwarding traffic.  Once security intelligence identifies the attack signature, mitigation is a matter of looking for traffic matching that signature and forwarding it away from the company’s servers. That sounds simple enough, but as the Dyn attack shows, DDoS protection is increasingly failing to protect company resources, for several reasons: Insufficient bandwidth.  The bad guys are winning the security arms race.  The most virulent DDoS attacks produce more traffic than current DDoS safeguards can process.  To protect against the kind of attacks leveled against Dyn last year, your DDoS solution needs to process 150 million packets per second for every 100Gbps of throughput.  Few of today’s DDoS solutions can do that. Inability to scale.  As noted above, mitigation is a form of traffic forwarding.  It is tempting to just add DDoS protection to your core router.  The problem is that your core routers are busy with core network routing chores.  When you add DDoS intelligence and mitigation to their workload you reduce their ability to do basic routing.  Core routers simply cannot scale to do both basic routing and DDoS protection – especially at the scale of attacks being seen recently. Lack of Location Flexibility.  Solutions that can keep up with today’s terabit-scale DDoS attacks are rare – and very expensive.  Their cost dictates that they sit at the very core of the network; it is simply too costly to place them at all your edge locations.  Yet this means rerouting all your traffic to the core for analysis and mitigation, a highly impractical solution.  Lack of Agility.  DDoS attacks are morphing quickly.  Many DDoS solutions lack the agility to update their intelligence and mitigation logic quickly as the industry identifies new DDoS attacks.  This is especially true when DDoS mitigation is deployed as rules in the core routers. Lack of Mitigation Flexibility.  Each DDoS attack is unique.  It follows that one’s mitigation strategy should be tailored to the specifics of that attack.  Yet that is often not the case.  Many large ISPs, for example, adopt a “cattle drive” mentality.  If one of their customers gets hit by a DDoS attack they move quickly to protect the rest of their customers by killing all traffic to and from that customer.  Essentially, they abandon the diseased cow by the roadside to save the rest of the herd. A more flexible solution would tailor a mitigation strategy that protects both the infected and non-infected customers simultaneously. Cost.  As mentioned above, DDoS solutions that can keep up with today’s terabit-scale attacks are astronomically expensive, causing many organizations to adopt a “duck and cover” approach (no protection and react to attacks manually). The Problem in a Nutshell The reason why existing DDoS solutions fall short is based on a fundamental architectural flaw.  Most solutions combine security intelligence with mitigation in a single solution.  As noted above, security intelligence requires complex software which can analyze traffic and detect even the most sophisticated attacks.  On the other hand, mitigation requires extremely fast hardware that can immediately enforce policy to reroute attack traffic at line-rate and without slowing the network down. When you put intelligence and mitigation in the same box you end up with a complex architecture that attempts to optimize the CPU complex needed for security intelligence with the raw hardware power for mitigation.  Complexity always leads to very high costs at purchase time as well as operationally over the life of the solution.  Or, if you do find a more affordable solution, the architecture is compromised and you end up underpowered in both intelligence and mitigation capacity. A better approach is to disaggregate security intelligence from mitigation, but how? Disaggregated Network Security: A Better Way When the security intelligence is separated from the mitigation and it communicates through an out of band interface, better and radically simplified DDoS protection is immediately possible. These interfaces include BGP Flow Spec and REST APIs.  The BGP Flow specification is a multi-vendor standard which allows multiple devices on a network to coordinate traffic filtering.  In this way, a large site can choose best-of-breed security intelligence solutions that sit at strategic points in the network and watch for attacks.  It is broadly used already, as are REST APIs. When the intelligence solution spots an attack it creates mitigation rules and sends them to the mitigation engine over these out-of-band interfaces.  This architecture provides several immediate and fundamental benefits: Best-of-Breed DDoS Protection.  By disaggregating security intelligence from mitigation, network architects are free to choose the very best intelligence solution and combine it with the very best mitigation solution.  As noted, these two activities have very different requirements, and it is unlikely any single solution is optimized for both. Terabit-class DDoS Mitigation.  As we saw above, mitigating high-volume DDoS attacks is demanding and requires extremely high-performance hardware.  That is easier to find in a pure-play mitigation solution than in a combined solution. Improved Location Flexibility.  By splitting DDoS into intelligence and mitigation, network architects can distribute each to its proper location in the network.  Put security intelligence where it belongs and mitigation where it belongs. Scalability.  Traffic volumes for DDoS attacks, currently topping out at 1.2 TB/sec, are forecast to grow even higher.  A pure-play mitigation solution makes it easier to design solutions that both scale out and up as needed. Agility and Mitigation Flexibility.  Disaggregated DDoS protection relies on using pure-play solutions for both security intelligence and mitigation.  These pure-play solutions will react and adapt to new attacks faster than bloated aggregated solutions because they are focusing on just their single aspect of DDoS protection.  This provides a more agile solution – one that adapts quickly to new attack vectors. It also enables more flexible mitigation strategies, such as filtering on sources of attack traffic instead of being limited to shutting down destinations. Affordability.  One of the core benefits of disaggregation is a reduction in costs.  Bloated all-in-one solutions come at a steep premium in cost.  Pure-play solutions not only perform better, but they also are less expensive. DDoS Will Continue to Evolve.  You Should Too. DDoS attacks have been around for nearly two decades.  But with the world’s first terabit-class attack, 2016 marked a turning point.  When even the largest Web scale sites are unable to withstand the largest DDoS attacks, it is time to evolve and adapt. Disaggregating security intelligence from mitigation is a strategy that provides fundamental benefits that will allow organizations to stay ahead of the bad guys in the DDoS arms race.

Project Soli involves a millimeter-wave radar chip that can detect "very fine" gestures with fingers and hands. It can then be used for playing games using hand gestures on mobile devices, computers, and electronics. The technology has the potential to get rid of controllers and input devices. Its biggest impact could be in virtual and augmented reality. When using VR headsets, users now need to hold controllers, but Project Soli could allow hand gesture movement to define how a user roams a virtual world. The chip is so tiny that Google has put it in devices as small as smartwatches. It was jointly developed by Google with Infineon, which has said the technology will be jointly marketed by both companies later this year. An announcement about the development kit was made at the recent Game Developer Conference. The goal for the developer kit is to discover new uses for the technology. Initially, Google is targeting Project Soli at game control using hand gestures. A demo showed a user flicking fingers on a device containing the Project Soli chip, and the finger movement controlled a character running on a screen. The quicker the fingers flicked, the faster the character ran. By moving the hand up or down, the character could jump over trees. One group at the University of St. Andrews in the U.K. used the technology to recognize materials based on weight and other characteristics. For example, it could detect copper, plastic, and other materials. Project Soli could be transformative technology and be used in applications beyond gaming, Aaron Cammarata, technical project lead at the Google Advanced Technology and Projects group (ATAP), said in a video posted on YouTube. The radar technology is highly reliable, and the response is quick because it uses millimeter-wave technology. Google ATAP is leading the projectÂ and works on technology that is then used in commercial products. One of its big flops was Project Ara, a modular smartphone that was scrapped by Google. ATAP also developed Tango, an augmented reality platform that is now part of Lenovo's Phab 2 Pro smartphone.Â  Later this year, Levi's will ship clothes with touch and gesture interactivity stitched into the fabric, and that functionality was developed as part of Google ATAP's Project Jacquard. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google and Levi’s Smart Commuter Jacket Lets You Wear Tech On Your Sleeve By Zara Ali Mar 13, 2017 14Shares Share Tweet Submit After two years of announcing their collaboration for connected clothing products, Google and Levi’s have finally come up with the final product – Project Jacquard Commuter Trucker jacket. With this product, Google is now trying to take wearable tech to some other level. Why have smart tech limited to your wrist or ears when you can wear it all over by shelling out $350. The main element is the fabric of the left sleeve on Commuter jacket. It has a rechargeable tag tucked inside it. On the whole, the entire fabric of the jacket is also smart as it is made up of conductive yarn that helps in all round touch functionality powered by the tag. The tag comes with support for USB charging, which makes it pretty easy for plug and charge. The functionalities on the Commuter jacket include playing music, opening lock screen, managing calendar, Google Maps, and much more as it pairs with your smartphone. Only snag being that it can’t work seamlessly with an iPhone. Related Google Confirms That It Won’t Bring Google Assistant To Android Tablets Advertisement Commenting on the Commuter jacket, Ivan Poupyrev, project lead for Project Jacquard at Google says: “It was a long road but what’s really impressive, is the entire journey, we stayed true to our vision and what we wanted to achieve. This jacket is going to be sold as a piece of apparel, that was always the vision from the very beginning.” You can access a variety of function on the jacket just by simple finger movements. For example – you can swipe your fingers to check the time on your phone, play-pause-forward the music, along with other features. To connect your phone to the Commuter jacket, you have to install “Project Jacquard” app on your phone and from the app you can pick gestures that you want for different functions. Levi’s also said that they are working on adding more gestures in the future, which would be helpful in making the jacket smarter. In a blog post, Paul Dillinger, head of global product innovation for Levi’s Strauss & Co, said: Related Latest Google Play Music Update Adds Wi-Fi Streaming And Playback Quality Options “Anyone on a bike knows that navigating your screen while navigating busy city streets isn’t easy – or a particularly good idea. This jacket helps to resolve that real-world challenge by becoming the co-pilot for your life, on and off your bike.” We can’t deny how cool the jacket looks with all the functionalities, but spending $350 could make it a hard sell.

By Josh Kolm 3 days ago Google’s Project Jacquard is an effort by the tech giant to weave technology into clothes, needing nothing more than a standard industrial loom to turn regular-looking garments into fully functional wearable tech. This week, the company – along with Levi’s, the inaugural brand partner on the project – lifted the veil on the first fruits of those efforts that will be available to consumers. Though it was initially announced last spring, the companies put the “Commuter x Jacquard” jacket on public display for the first time at SXSW. Despite looking like a typical Levi’s denim jacket, a small, barely visable area on the cuff has been programmed to recognize certain hand gestures. These are paired by the user with certain functions on their phone through an app. So, tapping your cuff can start, pause or skip songs, while waving your hand across it can have your phone tell you the time or read out directions to you without having to pull it out of your pocket. Levi’s has been working with Google on Jacquard since 2015, and the company says more applications for the tech are coming. When the jacket goes on sale later this year, it will retail for $350 USD. That’s a high price tag for consumers not interested in the latest and greatest tech, but it also shows that other fashion brands might have an opportunity to integrate smart functions into their own products in the near future. It also shows anyone that may have been scared off by the bulkiness of Google Glass that they don’t have to sacrifice style and design for the functions of wearable tech.

In a decision on Wednesday night, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, said it was unclear that the accord, which provided no money for plaintiffs but up to $2.2 million in fees and expenses for their lawyers, would ensure Google's compliance with federal and state privacy laws. Koh called the proposed disclosure notice inadequate. She said this was because it did not clearly reveal any technical changes that Google would make, or that Google scans non-Gmail users' emails to create ads for Gmail users. The judge also said the notice did not make clear that Google could still extract data for the "dual purpose" of creating targeted ads and detecting spam and malware, and then use that data once emails went into storage after being transmitted. "In sum, based on the parties' current filings, the court cannot conclude that the settlement is fundamentally fair, adequate, and reasonable," Koh wrote. Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc, declined to comment. Koh distinguished the settlement from a similar accord with Yahoo Inc that she said required more disclosures. Michael Sobol, a partner at Lieff Cabraser Heimann &amp; Bernstein representing the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. The named plaintiffs, Daniel Matera of New York and Susan Rashkis of San Francisco, had accused Google of violating the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act and California Invasion of Privacy Act through its scanning practices. Koh ruled six days after Google won preliminary approval from a different judge in her court of a separate $22.5 million settlement with businesses over internet ad placements. In that case, known as Google AdWords Litigation, businesses accused Google of placing their ads in obscure places such as error pages and undeveloped websites known as parked domains, causing them to overpay for the placements. The case is Matera v Google Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 15-04062.

If Plug and Play failed, you’ll have to manually install the drivers to enable communication between your computer and your phone. Installing Android drivers for Windows 10 is a really simple job. If all goes to plan, we’ll be done before bedtime. Install OEM Drivers OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer. Almost every Android device manufacturer has their own set of Android drivers. A handful of brands piggy-back on other manufacturers drivers, but they tend to be more obscure, such as OnePlus. To install OEM drivers, first head to the Android Developer site. Scroll down to the “Get OEM Drivers” section. Locate the drivers for your Android device manufacturer. If you don’t see your manufacturer, try an internet search for “[manufacturer name] android drivers.” The manufacturer should be one of the first results. Once you have downloaded the driver, you’ll need to install it. Plug your Android device into your PC. Press Windows Key + X, then select Device Manager. Scroll down to Portable Devices, and expand by clicking the bracket. Right-click the name of device, and select Update driver. This will open the driver update wizard. Choose Browse my computer for driver software. Browse to the OEM driver you previously downloaded. Select the driver, press OK, then Next to install the driver. It should only take a moment. While the driver will likely work immediately, it can be worth restarting your system. Official Google Tools For many moons, installing Android drivers was a lengthy process. You’d have to download the weighty Android SDK Tools, Android SDK Platform Tools, and Google USB Driver via the SDK Manager. The SDK Manager is bulky, and comes with a whole bunch of tools that quite frankly, the average user simply doesn’t need. Roll forward to January 2017, and Google has finally released ADB and fastboot as a standalone package. It really has been a long time coming. Google refers to their collection as the Platform Tools package. You can download the Platform Tools package directly from the SDK website. Once downloaded, extract the package to a memorable place. Once extracted, you don’t actually need to install anything. You simply open a Command Prompt in the SDK Platform Tools folder. Browse to the folder, hold Shift and right-click. Then select Open command window here from the context menu. Set PATH Variable Your computer knows where to find things.

If we add the location of the Platform Tools package, it’ll be much easier for you to use them in the future. Open the Start menu, and search for advanced system settings.

Select New when the new window opens, and paste the path to the Platforms Tools. Press Enter, then OK. The next time you need to use ADB or fastboot, you can simply open a command prompt window and enter your commands. 15-Second ADB Installer Before Google released their standalone package, Android users would have to download the Android SDK Manager, then select download packages. Irritating. Luckily, a jolly nice individual known as Snoop05 realized that this frustratingly long process could be significantly reduced. Thus, the 15-Second ADB Installer was born. To grab the fast installer, follow the previous link and scroll down to the download section. Once downloaded, double-click the executable. It will be named adb-setup-1.x.x.exe. You will now be asked a series of questions: Do you want to install ADB and Fastboot? Yes. Install ADB system-wide? User dependent — Do you share your system with someone else? Do you want to install device drivers? Yes. When you answer the final question, a new window will appear. This is the Google generic driver installation. Continue through the installation.

 Gmail app gets P2P upgrade BI Intelligence Mar. 16, 2017, 10:43 AM 1,539 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also THE MOBILE PAYMENTS IN CHINA REPORT: What the US can learn from China's enormous success in mobile payments Google and Facebook are tightening their stranglehold on the digital ad market You won’t recognize the new world of digital payments without this report This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Google is extending its previous support of peer-to-peer (P2P) payments for desktop users to the Gmail mobile app, according to Finextra. Four years after the feature was first enabled on desktop (2013), the mobile upgrade will let Android phone owners easily send money to their email contacts without leaving the email app. The feature is not yet available on iOS. Previously, they would have to open a separate mobile P2P app, such as Google Wallet or a competitor like Square Cash, to send a payment to an email contact. A couple of factors stand out about Google’s Gmail app upgrade. This is a slow transition to mobile for a digital titan. It is surprising that Google, which has been a leader in pioneering mobile ad sales alongside Facebook, would wait four years before determining mobile email users should have the same payments abilities as those online. While Google Wallet has been available for three of those years, since 2014, users had to leave their email app to transfer funds to contacts. WeChat Pay, the Chinese messaging-meets-P2P service, has shown that bridging communication with payments can have a tremendous effect – BI Intelligence estimates up to $299 billion was spent through the application in 2016 alone.  It begs revisiting Google’s split digital payments branding strategy. Google has two tools its users think of when they want to make payment: Android Pay (in-store, in-app, online payments) and Google Wallet (online and mobile P2P). As a brand, Google Wallet has a history that may further confuse users ­– it originally conducted mobile in-store payments, failed to catch on, and was later replaced by Android Pay. Consolidating all money movement capabilities under one brand could clear up confusion to users, and align marketing strategies for the two services. While the timing and execution of Google’s email payments upgrade could raise eyebrows, it is ultimately an encouraging progression for the company. Mobile P2P is rising — BI Intelligence forecasts that US mobile P2P volume will grow to $336 billion in 2021, up from $19 billion in 2015 — and adding Gmail app integration gives users one more way to pay with their phones, which could ultimately grow Google Wallet's volume. The move also represents Google thinking about new ways to differentiate the payments experience, in this case by connecting to mobile messaging environments. Continuing to experiment with new ingredients in the P2P payments formula – be that messaging, social network integration, or combining all of their other payment types (e.g., in-app, in-store, in-browser, or P2P) ­­– will allow Google stand out in a sea of competition.  Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, defined as informal payments made from one person to another, have long been a prominent feature of the payments industry. That’s because individuals transfer funds to each other on a regular basis, whether it's to make a recurring payment, reimburse a friend, or split a dinner bill.   Cash and checks have historically dominated the P2P ecosystem, and they’re still a popular tool. But as smartphones become a primary computing device, top digital platforms, like Venmo and Google Wallet, have enabled customers to turn away from cash and make those payments digitally with ease. Over the next few years, though overall P2P spend will remain constant, a shift to mobile payments across the board and increased spending power from the digital-savvy younger generation will cause the mobile P2P industry to skyrocket.  That poses a problem for firms providing these services, though. Historically, most of these players have taken on mobile P2P at a loss because it’s a low-friction way to onboard users and won’t catch on unless it’s free, or largely free, to consumers. But as it becomes more popular and starts to eat into these firms’ traditional streams of revenue, finding ways to monetize is increasingly important. That could mean moving P2P functionality into more profitable environments, leveraging existing networks of friends to encourage spending, or offering value-added services at a nominal fee. Jaime Toplin, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile P2P payments that examines what’s driving this shift to mobile P2P and explains why companies need to find a way to capitalize on it quickly. It discusses how firms can use the tools they have to gain in the P2P space, details several cases, and evaluates which strategies might be the most effective in monetizing these platforms. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Consumers still want mobile P2P services, and they’re turning to them. Individuals pay their peers on a regular basis, and as smartphones are increasingly used as computing devices, these consumers look to such services for fast and easy ways to pay.  Monetizing P2P is more important than ever. Initially, P2P was a valuable onboarding tool for companies, and when it was still a small segment, taking it on at little value or a loss didn’t have major implications. But as volume grows and user bases scale fast, finding ways to monetize quickly should be a priority for firms looking to stay ahead. New technology could put some apps ahead of their peers. P2P continues to rely on networks, especially for informal, social transactions. But rather than having a large network, it’s becoming important for firms to understand their user bases and the networks within them. This means that chat apps, and leveraging bot and AI technology, may offer a distinct advantage. In full, the report: Forecasts the growth of the P2P market, and what portion of that will come from mobile channels, through 2021. Explains the factors driving that growth and details why it will come from increased usage, not increased spend per user. Evaluates why mobile P2P isn’t profitable for companies, and details several cases of attempts to monetize. Assesses which of these strategies could be most successful, and what companies need to leverage to succeed in the space.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 16, 2017 8:16 AM PT Credit: Google More like this Google's researchers just stole I/O with smart pants, a password killer, and... Android's next destination: Untethered VR headsets with the Snapdragon 835 10 smartphone trends to watch in 2017 Video Hands-on with Visa's NFC sunglasses Google will start shipping development kits for its Project Soli wireless gesture recognition technology later this year. Project Soli involves a millimeter-wave radar chip that can detect “very fine” gestures with fingers and hands. It can then be used for playing games using hand gestures on mobile devices, computers, and electronics. The technology has the potential to get rid of controllers and input devices. Its biggest impact could be in virtual and augmented reality. When using VR headsets, users now need to hold controllers, but Project Soli could allow hand gesture movement to define how a user roams a virtual world. The chip is so tiny that Google has put it in devices as small as smartwatches. It was jointly developed by Google with Infineon, which has said the technology will be jointly marketed by both companies later this year. An announcement about the development kit was made at the recent Game Developer Conference. The goal for the developer kit is to discover new uses for the technology. Initially, Google is targeting Project Soli at game control using hand gestures. A demo showed a user flicking fingers on a device containing the Project Soli chip, and the finger movement controlled a character running on a screen. The quicker the fingers flicked, the faster the character ran. By moving the hand up or down, the character could jump over trees. One group at the University of St. Andrews in the U.K. used the technology to recognize materials based on weight and other characteristics. For example, it could detect copper, plastic, and other materials. Project Soli could be transformative technology and be used in applications beyond gaming, Aaron Cammarata, technical project lead at the Google Advanced Technology and Projects group (ATAP), said in a video posted on YouTube. The radar technology is highly reliable, and the response is quick because it uses millimeter-wave technology. Google ATAP is leading the project and works on technology that is then used in commercial products. One of its big flops was Project Ara, a modular smartphone that was scrapped by Google. ATAP also developed Tango, an augmented reality platform that is now part of Lenovo’s Phab 2 Pro smartphone.  Later this year, Levi’s will ship clothes with touch and gesture interactivity stitched into the fabric, and that functionality was developed as part of Google ATAP’s Project Jacquard.

US residents snapping up the Google Assistant-enabled phone before April 30 will get a Google Home speaker (worth $129) on the house. However, we can now reveal that the offer won't be extended to UK buyers of LG’s new flagship, as according to the company we have "differing requirements" here in Blighty. "We will be offering value-add deals for the G6 in the UK, in line with our partners’ needs. However, given the differing requirements across the UK and US markets, we do not have plans to offer the Google Home deal to customers in the UK," LG told TrustedReviews in a statement. The Google Home speaker was recently announced as “coming soon” to the UK market, with Google hotly tipped to be revealing more details pertaining to the official release date on March 28. Related: Google Home tips and tricks A free Google Home could have softened the financial burden of acquiring an LG G6, if leaked pricing proves to be accurate. Earlier this week a German retailer began listing the edge-to-edge device for €749, which comes to about £655/$729. Considering the LG G5 was available from £529, that would represent quite a leap for a firm looking to get back into the good graces of smartphone users following an off year in 2016. From a device quality standpoint, our first impressions of the Android Nougat device certainly suggests a triumphant return to form for the Korean tech giant. It has an 18:9 quad-HD display, HDR10 and Dolby Vision, wireless charging (US-only) and the Snapdragon 821 processor doing the heavy lifting. After a week with the G6, Mobile Editor Max Parker wrote: “I believe this to be LG’s best phone in years, but with the competition improving too, it’s a tough call as to whether or not this will stand up against the upcoming iPhone 8 and Samsung Galaxy S8. Price will be a big factor, and if this comes in cheaper than those models then LG could have a winner on its hands.” Our full review will be coming shortly, so stay tuned. Will you be grabbing the LG G6 at launch or waiting to see what the Samsung Galaxy S8 and HTC 11 have to offer? Lend us your thoughts below.

If you had dreams of getting Google Assistant up on your slate, Google has confirmed that tablets will not be receiving the goods at this time. The company didn’t give any real reason why they won’t do it, only reiterating that the current rollout of Assistant is only for Google Play Services phones running Marshmallow or higher. This isn’t a hard confirmation that tablets will never get Assistant, mind you, it’s just that for this particular rollout in this moment of time, it’s phones only. Fingers crossed that Google eventually broadens their scope.

Parental controls will be helpful in managing and tracking the screen time, daily limits and device “bedtimes,” and the selected apps that kids can use. WDnetStudio / Pixabay How this Google app works To access the app, users first need to download the Family Link app and create the Family Group on Google. Parents will manage the group, and thereafter, they can create accounts for the kids. If the Gmail address of the child was created a year ago, it cannot be used in this new app. A credit card is also required since Google charges 30 cents as official parental consent, notes Mashable. Even though Google has tried to keep the app simple, it takes more time compared to the average app purchase. Parents are also prompted to check all pre-installed Google apps before downloading parental control. It becomes an unavoidable step because the majority of apps were not created for kids, and therefore, parents will need to review the permission for each, notes Mashable. After the child signs in with the credentials, all activities are tracked so that parents can learn how much time he spends on various apps. There are weekly and monthly activity reports, and both mom and dad will be able to define a set of rules for their kids, such as time spent on mobile devices every day. If the amount of the child’s mobile use exceeds the limit set by the parents, they can lock it remotely. How it’s different from other similar apps Google’s Family Link is different from the apps offered by Amazon and Apple in that it is a two-party system and is more like a third-party parental control and monitoring software in the market, according to TechCrunch. With the help of Family Link, Google will be able to track what the kids are watching on the Internet at younger ages. Family Link will also allow them to access Google accounts with the help of a Gmail address and services such as Maps and search. However, these accounts will be under the control of the parents. Google’s intention can be questioned here. Some might argue that the company is tapping the kids when they are young. But the truth is that kids are already on various Google apps even before the age of 13, mostly with the permission of their parents.

While it’s no major update, 7.1.1 brings along some welcome changes for the device, as well as bringing updated security patch levels to the phone. The best gifts for Android users Right now, few smartphones carry the Android 7.1.1 update, with Google’s Pixel phones and most Nexus devices being the only notable devices with the update, although OnePlus does currently have it in beta for the OnePlus 3/T. Like with Nexus and Pixel devices, Android 7.1.1 for the Axon brings along with it a few minor changes, such as added emojis, the ability to send GIFs directly in text fields with supported apps and keyboards, and app shortcuts on supported launchers. ZTE also says that this update adds enhancements for Daydream VR and brings the phone up to February’s monthly security patch. The full changelog follows, and the update should be available soon for all Axon 7 owners. T-Mobile Wi-Fi Calling support – T-Mobile Axon 7 users will now be able to send and receive both calls and text messages over Wi-Fi. Don’t have service in a certain area? Don’t miss a beat by connecting to a wireless network to continue talking and texting. More ways to communicate – With 7.1.1, Google made all its emojis gender-equal, representing a wider range of professions for both men and women – so now you can be the astronaut you always wanted. Plus, you gain the ability to send gifs directly from your keyboard on supported apps. Go ahead, express yourself! Daydream update & optimization – One of our favorite 2017 announcements was that the Axon 7 was finally Daydream-ready! With Android 7.1.1, we’re making your virtual reality even better by updating and optimizing your experience. Google security patches updates through Feb 2017 – Speaking of security, Google fixed all of its known vulnerabilities with 7.1.1. Sound boring? You may be right, but these patches are critical in keeping your information even more safe while sending emails, browsing the website, texting, or processing media files.

And yes it’s for kids also. According to the blog post this new application is designed for parents and it will let them create their child first Google account and some other parental controls, like managing the apps your kid can use, keeping an eye on screen time, and setting a bedtime on your kid’s device. According to Google this is what you will get with Family Link Manage the apps your kid can use: Approve or block the apps your kid wants to download from the Google Play Store. Keep an eye on screen time: See how much time your kid spends on their favorite apps with weekly or monthly activity reports, and set daily screen time limits for their device. Set device bedtime: Remotely lock your kid’s device when it’s time to play, study, or sleep. In order to use it both parents and children must use Android smartphones. So the first action is to download the Family Link mobile app to a device that has Android KitKat (4.4) or higher. Unfortunately there isn’t an iOS version available. At least for the time being. Also the app is suitable for kids 13 and younger and their parents will set up the Google account. After you set the account you have to sign in from your child’s smartphone or tablet which must have Android Nougat (7.0), or a supported device running Marshmallow (6.1). You can find the full list here. And then parents can actually track down the activity from their kid’s phone. They can monitor how much time the child spends in apps and set boundaries. For example parents can block or approve apps. But this decision is left up to the parents, Google doesn’t make any suggestions. As for Google’s apps Family Link allow parents to change the filtering options remotely for  Google Search app and the Chrome browser. Of course this if for the kids safety and it will protect them from inappropriate content that they come across on the web. And if Google has an application for parent monitoring for Android phones and tablets, the company will have an new ally for the markets. The app Family Link is not available for everyone for the time being. But, Google offers early access to users who want to test it and give valuable feedback.

Amazon's phenomenally popular Echo speaker pioneered the idea of a music system with a built-in personal assistant. And it didn't take long for Google to follow in the retailer's footsteps. Last year, it announced Google Home, a wi-fi connected speaker system that included the power of the world's biggest search engine. Employing the same Google Assistant technology as its popular Pixel smartphones, Google's voice-activated speaker will read you the news, answer questions and remind you to put the kettle on.

ZTE Axon 7 Gets Android 7.1.1 Update With WiFi Calling on T-Mobile GO The update also brings February security patch Mar 16, 2017 14:42 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Axon 7 was updated from Marshmallow to Nougat last month and it seems that ZTE has already started to roll out the 7.1.1 Nougat update for the smartphone. The update brings some changes, as well as the updated security patch. Axon 7 smartphones will support WiFi calling for T-Mobile subscribers, this means that users will be able to send and receive text messages and calls over WiFi. The feature would come in handy especially when users don’t have a reliable mobile connection or wish to save on their data plan by connecting to a wireless network. In addition, Android 7.1.1 Nougat brings a feature for sending gifs directly from the keyboard on supported applications. The update will also add enhancements to Google Daydream in order to optimize and improve the experience for users, according to a report. Google made emojis gender-equal with Android 7.1.1 Nougat, and the feature will now be available to Axon 7 users. Google security patch for February 2017 The 7.1.1 Nougat update also includes Google’s security patch updates, which fix all known vulnerabilities with 7.1.1. This update proves that ZTE is determined to provide its users with timely OS updates, especially for the high-end but cheap Axon 7. However, last month’s 7.0 Nougat update was delayed, after the company announced that the update didn’t meet expectations and quality standards while in beta test. The smartphone comes with a 5.5-inch AMOLED display with QUAD HD (2560 x 1440 pixels) resolution and a 20MP rear camera with dual image stabilization, including iOS and EIS. The main camera also has sapphire crystal lens and enhanced dual-LED flash. Moreover, the Axon 7 runs Snapdragon 820 chipset, has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal memory. It’s the cheapest Daydream-ready smartphone in the United States, carrying a price tag of about $400. The battery inside the smartphone is 3,250mAh and the phone is available in multiple colors, including gold, grey and silver. #ZTE#Axon 7#Android 7.1.1 Nougat#T-Mobile#WiFi calling subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Officially Brings WebVR to Chrome on Android ZTE Axon 7 Gets Daydream Support Alongside Android 7.0 Nougat Update Head of Design Departs HTC to Join Google Daydream Division ZTE Postpones Android 7.0 Nougat Update for the Axon 7 Samsung Galaxy S8 Scores the Highest on AnTuTu, Video Shows Microsoft Says Windows 10 Users Might Receive Critical Updates No Matter What New Windows 10 ISO Available for Download (Build 15058) Microsoft Launches Windows 10 Build 15061 for PCs Samsung Galaxy S8 Scores the Highest on AnTuTu, Video Shows Android O Could Feature Notification Revamp and Picture-in-Picture Microsoft Loves iPhones: OneDrive App Updated with iMessage Support Say Goodbye to Another Microsoft App on Old Windows Phones    Axon 7 New Android APKs T-Mobile DIGITS APK: Updated March 18th, 20:47 GMT Sweet Selfie APK: Updated March 18th, 20:42 GMT Battery Doctor APK: Updated March 18th, 20:36 GMT 360 Battery Plus APK: Updated March 18th, 20:31 GMT Retrica APK: Updated March 18th, 20:26 GMT Adobe Photoshop Lightroom APK: Updated March 18th, 20:16 GMT LocalCast APK: Updated March 17th, 13:57 GMT Reader comments Samsung Galaxy S8+ Running Exynos 8895 Chip Spotted in Benchmark more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Shares Though the library of available virtual reality content is increasing daily, user uptake of that content is still slower than many companies invested in the tech would like. One such company is Google, which has recently published a patent for its idea to turn Android phone packaging into a VR wearable. It is, essentially, a Google Cardboard VR viewer, but one that your phone actually ships in. Rather than an advanced headset construction, the patent specifically points to the use of cardboard and thick paper stock, as well as "adhesives" and "fabric" components.  That's fine – an expensive smartphone need not have extra zeroes added to its price tag for an optional function, while it'd be a pleasant additional feature to have a "lite" VR option straight out of the box. VR for everyone It's the ultimate conclusion for Google's Cardboard tech, which looked to bring VR affordable to the masses. For those enamored with what they get from this introductory experience, there's always the  Google Daydream View to upgrade to. Google is hardly the first company to explore this idea, though. McDonald's had Happy Meal "Happy Googles" built into its takeaway meal boxes, while Alcatel's Idol 45 also worked a VR viewer shell into a single smartphone purchase. There's also the green-friendly benefit to consider here too – you've suddenly a reason to hold onto a box you'd otherwise throw away. So thumbs up all round here – hopefully it's a patent Google will put into practice.

The recent report suggests that Snowden’s claims were, in fact, correct, and Google’s new messaging application is not handy when it comes to day to day use. Google’s new virtual assistant appears to have a bug that provided unrelated personal information to the user’s friends. According to Independent, company’s new app, Allo, is capable of sharing the user’s past Google searches with their contacts. According to the publication, the recent discovery was made by Re/code’s Tess Townsend, who apparently was using Google’s new messaging application to chat with a friend. “In the middle of our conversation, my friend directed Assistant to identify itself,” wrote Ms. Townsend. “Instead of offering a name or a pithy retort, it responded with a link from Harry Potter fan website Pottermore.” [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Ms. Townsend further stated that neither she nor her friend had mentioned Harry Potter in their conversation before Google’s new messaging application brought it up. “But the response was not merely a non-sequitur,” continues Ms. Townsend. “It was a result related to previous searches my friend said he had done a few days earlier.” Like any other messaging application, even Google’s Allo is supposed to request permission from a user before sharing their personal information on social media platforms or among their friends, but this privacy feature of Google does not always work. Things became awkward for Ms. Townsend when she asked Allo about her occupation. Instead of showing the publicly listed address of her employer, Google’s virtual assistant shared a Google Maps image with the address of a co-working space she had used in the past. “Google had the address on file because I had included it in my personal Google Maps settings,” wrote Ms. Townsend. “It did not ask my permission to share that.” It was not long ago when Edward Snowden issued a warning not to use Google’s messaging app under any circumstances. The famous whistleblower warned everyone not to use Allo as it lets the company read everything that the user say. Free for download today: Google Mail, Google Maps, and Google Surveillance. That's #Allo. Don't use Allo. https://t.co/EdPRC0G7Py — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016 Google’s virtual assistant comes with a robot that watches everything people say, and then it stores it for later analysis. The stored data helps the application to respond faster in the future. But it also means that all the chats may stay on Google’s servers indefinitely, and they are able to read it as well. Google had initially indicated that the stored messages would stay on the servers temporarily, limiting the possibility of any data breach. Google had revealed in the past that by storing the information, it makes Allo more useful, but many people have claimed that by collecting that information, Google was putting people at risk of being spied on by the government. Google has issued a statement about the slip-up and stated that they had fixed the issue. “We were notified about the Assistant in group chats not working as intended. We’ve fixed the issue and appreciate the report.” [Image by David McNew/Getty Images] Meanwhile, Amazon’s smart gadget is also under the scrutiny. Earlier this month, a clip surfaced online that showed an anonymous woman asking Amazon’s Alexa a series of questions starting with, “would you lie to me” and finishing it with, “Alexa, are you connected to the CIA?” Amazon’s virtual assistant swiftly responded to the earlier questions, but it abruptly shut down after the woman asked about its connections with the U.S. government agency. @amazon #alexa the @CIA best tool for spying on unassuming Americans ????????????#daylightsavings#SundayMorning#tcot #ccothttps://t.co/GE6luaIj8m — Stephen Janiszak (@StephenJaniszak) March 12, 2017 Amazon’s spokesperson told DailyMail.com that when the woman in the video asked those questions to their virtual assistant, it encountered with a glitch, and the spokesperson stated that Alexa’s response to “Are you connected to the CIA?” is “No, I work for Amazon.” As of now, both the major companies claim to have resolved the ongoing issues.

The search engine's trends Twitter page tweeted out a bracket based on search interest across Google. Duke wins the tournament, meeting Gonzaga in the Final Four. Michigan and North Carolina also make the Final Four. Big upsets on the Google Trends bracket include Wisconsin over Villanova in the second round and Florida Gulf State making the Sweet Sixteen. It also features No. 15 North Kentucky defeated No. 2 Kentucky in the first round. Again, this is based on search interest. Will @dukebasketball win #MarchMadness?

Google Trends data show that the University of Michigan’s basketball team leads the nation in overall searches, ranking ahead of the Wisconsin Badgers, North Carolina Tar Heels, Villanova Wildcats and Gonzaga Bulldogs. The top five would indicate that Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Villanova would meet in the Final Four, but that’s impossible since Villanova and Wisconsin could meet in the second round of the tournament. Comment on this story The data also show that the Midwest has March Madness fever. Sioux City, Iowa, showed the most interest through search, along with Madison, Wisconsin; Cincinnati; Green Bay, Wisconsin; and Topeka, Kansas. Salt Lake City, which hosts six of the tournament’s games, has a 73 percent interest in the tournament. That’s about as much as Spokane, Washington, home of Gonzaga.

In other words, breaking into the top ten on Google is by no means, easy. Given that white hat SEO strategy takes a lot of time, some SEO practitioners still choose to cut corners when optimizing their pages. For obvious reasons, I don’t recommend using any of the black hat SEO techniques. But it can be challenging to tell white hat SEO from its black hat variety, or draw a distinctive line between white hat and gray hat optimization. Search engine optimization is constantly evolving, and some of the techniques that were once legitimate are strictly forbidden now. Let’s set the record straight. Let’s dive into the six on-page optimization techniques that Google dislikes and could get your website penalized. #1 Keyword Stuffing Digital marketers today recognize the importance and value of content marketing. Several years ago, however, marketers could produce tons of thin content with zero value to push their way through to the top of search results. Keyword stuffing (or keyword stacking) was one of the most common content generation methods due to its simple process: Research search terms you want to rank for (look for exact-match type keywords) Produce content with a focus on the topic but not too in-depth Stuff content with keywords (repeat the exact-match keywords and phrases frequently) Make sure that meta-tags are also stuffed with keywords Like this: See how one keyword phrase is repeated again and again? Fortunately, Google Panda made that on-page optimization method obsolete in 2011. The Google of 2017 favors meaningful and authentic content. It is smart enough to easily detect and penalize sites with thin, low quality, or plagiarized content so marketers should avoid stuffing their content with repetitive keywords. Solution Embrace a “reader’s first” approach. Develop a habit of creating content that really matters to your targeted audience. Keywords should always come second. Use your main keyword sparingly (2-3 times per 500 words) and include a couple of highly relevant and long-tail keywords to help crawlers identify the value of your content. To improve your marketing strategy, consider using a variety of keywords to get your content noticed. #2 Spammy Footer Links and Tags A footer is a must-have element for any website. It helps visitors navigate between multiple website sections and provides access to additional information such as contact info and a copyright license. The example below demonstrates how useful an info-heavy footer can be: Here we have a Forbes logo with tabs leading to the website’s main sections like Business or Technology, Featured Products, and Company Info. The footer also features multiple section headlines that allow users to easily access every part of the website. Let’s imagine, though, that a website’s footer is stuffed with hundreds of links and tags. How do you feel about the footer below? Quite user-unfriendly, right? It’s no wonder that websites relying on link- and tag-filled footers were penalized. They were hit by two algorithm updates: Panda, which targeted poor website structure, and Penguin, which flagged sites engaging in link and tag manipulation. Avoid spammy footers to achieve a higher search engine ranking position. Solution When you optimize a site, make sure it has a nice and clean footer that features vital data like contact information, address, working hours, terms of use, copyright license, navigation buttons, subscription field, and more. But spamming the footer is a big no-no. #3 Cloaking This old school SEO technique is rooted in the ability to display two separate pieces of content on a single webpage. The first text is “fed” to bots for further crawling, while the second one is showcased to actual readers. What did cloaking accomplish? Manipulate search engines to receive higher SERPs Allow a specific page to rank high while remaining easy for users to read Deliver “unrelated content” for common requests (e.g. you search “cute little puppies” but end up on a porn site) Cloaking is an advanced black hat SEO method. To harness its true power, you should be able to identify search engine spiders by IP and deliver different webpage content to them. This also requires abusing specific server-side scripts and “behind the scenes” code. Cloaking is a tactic that was marked as “black hat” years ago. Google has never found it legitimate, but nonetheless, it is widely used in the so-called DeepWeb. Solution This one is simple: avoid cloaking. Don’t risk your reputation for a quick SERP ranking. #4 Internal Linking With Keyword-rich Anchor Text Internal linking is not always a bad thing. Ideally, linking allows you to connect web pages to create properly structured “paths” for search crawlers to index your site from A to Z. But marketers must walk a fine line when it comes to internal linking. When you repeatedly link your site’s inner pages with keyword-rich anchor texts, this raises a big red flag to Google. You can risk being hit with an over-optimization penalty. Once, keyword-rich anchor texts were the holy grail of SEO. All you had to do to significantly improve a page’s search engine position was to link it to other pages using similar keyword-rich anchor texts. Basically, you would have one URL and several keyword variations to use in anchor texts, like this: The three sentences from the example above are located on different pages but feature one URL and similar anchor text. This can negatively impact your website and result in a number of harmful penalties from Google. Solution Google puts value first. Make sure the word “value” dominates your content creation process as well. The same is true for links: place them only where they bring real value to users. And don’t forget to use different anchor texts for your inner links. #5 Dedicated Pages for Every Keyword Variant For a long time, keywords played a critical role in how your pages ranked. Though their importance is on the decline, keywords are by no means dead. These days, you can’t stuff your site with multiple variations of targeted keywords to boost rankings. Instead, focus on: Proper keyword selection Topic and context User intent You must be careful and avoid over-optimizing your websites. Remember: Panda, Hummingbird, and RankBrain are always looking for sites that are abusing keywords. In old-school SEO practices, over-optimization was a must. In addition, acquiring a high search engine ranking position required the creation of specific pages for every keyword variant. Suppose you wanted to rank your website that sold “custom rings.” Your win-win strategy would be to create dedicated pages for “custom unique rings,” “custom personalized rings,” custom design rings,” and every other variation involving the words “custom” and “rings.” The idea was pretty straightforward: marketers would target all keywords individually to dominate search by every keyword variation. You sacrifice usability but drive tons of traffic. This on-page SEO method was 100% legitimate several years ago but if you were to try this strategy today, you run the risk of receiving a manual action penalty. Solution To avoid a manual action penalty, don’t create separate pages for each particular keyword variant. Google’s “rules” for calculating SERPs have significantly changed, rendering old-time strategies obsolete. Utilizing the advanced power of its search algorithms and RankBrain, Google now prioritizes sites that bring actual value to users. Your best strategy to reach the top is to create visually and structurally appealing landing pages for your products and services, post high-quality, SEO-optimized content in your blog, and build a loyal following on social media platforms. #6 Content Swapping Google has been a powerhouse for more than a decade. They employed thousands of people and invested billions of dollars into their research and development departments, but their search engine lagged in intelligence for several years. SEO strategies previously could easily trick Google. For example, content swapping was one way to manipulate Google’s algorithms and indexing protocols. It worked like this: Post a piece of content on a site Wait until Google bots crawl and index it Make sure that a site is displayed in the search Close a page or entire site from indexation Swap content This would result in a page that originally featured an article about tobacco pipes but ended up with swapped content on prohibited medications or banned substances. Content swapping has always been forbidden, but advanced black hat SEO professionals used the technique because Google wasn’t quick enough to reindex sites. Now with changes in the SEO landscape, Google can almost immediately cut the search ranking of any site that’s closed from indexation. This is exactly why content swapping is no longer a viable strategy as it can result in significant penalties. Solution Content is king. If you want to hit Google’s top, prioritize creating dense content that provides as much information as possible and adds value to your audience. Google hates sites that manipulate content, so stay away from content swapping. Conclusion For better or worse, on-page SEO never stays still. Launching one algorithm update after another, Google is constantly pushing SEO experts and digital marketers to find new opportunities to improve their rankings via organic search. Google drives innovation forward, making some of the most popular on-page optimization techniques of the past outdated. No longer can marketers rely on keyword stuffing, thin content, and the myriad of other grey and black hat on-page SEO methods. SEO strategies of the past were technical and manipulative but lacked long-term sustainability. A true SEO pro could easily trick Google by stuffing content with keywords and paid links. The only problem was, it didn’t bring any real value to customers. Do you need to deliver value? Regardless of where your website currently ranks, every company can benefit from an updated SEO strategy. The key is to avoid using the SEO techniques described above and to pursue legal, white hat SEO tactics in the future.

Twitter Facebook Follow us: Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Paid Search Content Marketing Social Media Tools Advertise Rank Tracking in a RankBrain World SEO March 16, 2017 SEO Clark BoydMarch 16, 2017 357SHARES 641READS 357SHARES 641READS Clark Boyd 357SHARES 641READS ADVERTISEMENT We no longer live in a world of 10 blue links, but some elements of SEO hold stubbornly true. People continue to type (or say) search queries, they continue to be presented with options, and they make a choice. As a result, it still matters where your website ranks. It matters whether consumers choose your listing over the competition. So it stands to reason that we want to track these positions as accurately as possible; they are the lifeblood of a successful SEO campaign. However, Google’s search algorithms have incorporated an increasing number of factors over the years that have made it more difficult to know exactly where a URL ranks for a search query on a broad scale. Search ranking data is further obfuscated by the growth of mobile search, local results, and the expanding presence of paid listings. In the case of the latter, the continuing success of Google advertising is driven by the clear causal link between ad dollars spent and the return on that investment. Conversely, the SEO rankings picture continues to grow murkier, with RankBrain at the heart of Google’s ever more sophisticated algorithms. The Impact of RankBrain on Search Results RankBrain is Google’s artificial intelligence program that now affects all queries, and it is particularly powerful when processing queries Google has never seen before. Many consider RankBrain to be part of the Hummingbird algorithm, although this is unconfirmed. It is, however, part of a broader movement towards advanced conversational search and natural language processing of queries. Therefore, RankBrain can improve the quality of search results and help Google (and brands) start to deliver on that eternal-but-elusive marketing goal of bringing the right result to the right user at the right time. Although much of the potential of this technology remains untapped, there are signs of progress within everyday search results. See, for example, the concertina effect visible in ‘People also ask’ boxes, which expand and adapt based on the user’s interaction with the listings: This creates new opportunities for relevant content to appear, but it does make it harder to predict exactly when, where, and with what frequency our informational content will rank. Moreover, as part of a wider and interconnected ecosystem containing a mobile-first index, local search, and voice-based queries, we emerge with a constantly shifting landscape that refuses to satiate the digital marketer’s desire for accurate measurement. How Can We Measure Something That Is in Constant Flux? To tackle this question, it would first be worth outlining the core challenges we are now facing as SEO practitioners in a RankBrain-tinged landscape: Machine learning is a continually developing process, so measuring comparative data over a period of time is no longer the success indicator it once was. Similarly, if a campaign has to be reactive and responsive to this process, it is hard to benchmark and give detailed reports on an ongoing basis. With the inclusion of natural language processing as a core part of the algorithm, the possibilities of keyword variations can become unmanageable to track. And as RankBrain allows for heavily personalized results, it’s increasingly difficult to predict the kind of keywords and content a site’s audience will engage with. Finally, it is very complex for humans to handle the amounts of written language and transform it into relatable vectors in the same way that RankBrain does. Results can differ by form (image, video, rich snippet), depending on the device used, the user’s location, or the user’s browsing history. How are Rank Tracking Platforms Tackling This? At face value, many rank trackers seem simply to provide an illusion of stability in a permanently shifting data set. Weekly ranking reports present a comforting (admittedly, sometimes discomforting) view of how our pages are performing, but it can be hard to accept and understand that this is not reflective of what so many of our customers see when they search. Once more, it stands to reason that we seek clarity on this, as our SEO rankings shape important business decisions and we want the data to be reliable. It is a challenging conundrum for rank trackers; something simply has to give, if they are to provide one final number as a ranking position for each query. To their credit, the major players in this space have taken the issue seriously. Frequent crawls are run across locations and devices and vast data sets are normalized, so this is not a matter of simply pulling one set of rankings and presenting this as gospel truth. One restricting factor is that many of their customers feel ill-at-ease with the fact that so much instability is inherent within their own data. As such, an ideological shift is required if we are to come to terms with, and avail of, this new landscape, but it is not necessarily one that requires us to jettison keyword tracking altogether. So How Could We Approach Rank Tracking More Effectively? The answer to this may lie in targeting and tracking topics in broader keyword clusters, much in the way that Moz’s Keyword Explorer allows us to do. The mindset that this encourages is one that values relevance over sheer quantity, an approach that SEO professionals have been forced towards already with the evasive nature of accurate search volumes. TechCrunch also notes that as RankBrain continues to grow in sophistication, it will become harder for SEOs to use any of the old shortcuts to success. This will lead to a greater emphasis on using analytics platforms and a deeper understanding of audience and their neighborhood (both physical and digital) to optimize a site. Therefore, as we gain more insight into user behavior across devices and channels, we would be better advised to analyze ranking positions within audience segments, rather than by device or location. This level of specificity would be reflective of — and reward — sophisticated content marketing efforts that pay close attention to audience needs. In the meantime, the good news is that while all of the above serves to remind us that the way we need to build strategies has changed, there is still room in any SEO campaign for keyword research. Nonetheless, a shift needs to take place from aiming for the most popular queries to targeting the most relevant queries for a site’s offering. This doesn’t mean an abandonment of all frequently searched phrases and a race to the bottom to capture every 10-search phrase for each site, but it does mean that SEOs and clients need to think about success differently. As RankBrain works by connecting convoluted or ambiguous queries with their more popular counterparts, it is constantly learning more about the general topic of these queries. Thus, populating a site hierarchy with interrelated and thoroughly covered topics will continue to increase a brand’s overall visibility and user engagement metrics. By continuing down the path of measuring rankings at a topic level rather than at query level, we can continue to use keyword rankings as a reliable metric of a campaign’s success. An essential consideration is that these lists are no longer static, but change upon regular analysis of data such as CTRs from the SERPs, site search results, audience interaction with the site, and of course aggregated rankings across the topic as a whole. As long as people continue to search using typed or spoken queries and brands compete to respond to the query, rank tracking will matter to businesses. However, for this practice to retain its relevance and improve its accuracy, some significant upgrades will be required to reflect a RankBrain-driven search industry.

Google Assistant Will Not Be Pushed to Android Tablets GO The digital assistant will remain a smartphone affair Mar 16, 2017 14:29 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Google announced last month that its Assistant app would come to more Android smartphones in the coming weeks, but it did not mention anything about tablets. Surely, there are many customers out there wanting to take advantage of Assistant's features on their Android tablets. Unfortunately, that won't be possible since Google has confirmed its digital personal assistant will remain a smartphone affair. Reputable Android website AndroidPolice has reached out to Google to learn more about the company's plans in regard to Assistant, and whether or not these plans included Android tablets as well. The official answer is definitely disappointing for those who own Android tablets: “The Assistant will be available on Android Marshmallow and Nougat phones with Google Play Services, this does not include tablets.” Of course, Google can change its mind at any time, but we believe that's unlikely to happen. If you're waiting for Google Assistant to arrive on your Android tablet, then you can let it go now and start looking for it on an Android smartphone instead. You can still get Google Assistant on Android tablets through unofficial means Or, you can go ahead and use a more unorthodox approach like editing the build.prop file to bring Google Assistant to life on your Android tablet. The solution has been in the wild for quite a long time, and it still works. However, for the time being, you can stop hoping that Google Assistant will arrive on Android tablets through official means. If anything changes, we'll definitely update the news. In the meantime, Google continues to push its Assistant to even more smartphones. As many of you probably know by now, all smartphones powered by Marshmallow and Nougat are eligible to receive the Assistant. Keep in mind, though, that the Assistant will arrive on your phone through an update to Google Play Services, so if you notice that it is available to download, then there's a high chance you'll be getting the digital personal assistant. #Google Assistant#Android tablet#digital personal assistant#Android smartphone#Google app subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Assistant in Allo App Can Reveal Your Search History to Friends Google Announces New Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat Services Google Assistant Can Now Read and Interact with Text Messages Google Assistant Could Soon Arrive on Apple's iPhone Samsung Galaxy S8 Scores the Highest on AnTuTu, Video Shows Microsoft Says Windows 10 Users Might Receive Critical Updates No Matter What New Windows 10 ISO Available for Download (Build 15058) Microsoft Launches Windows 10 Build 15061 for PCs Samsung Galaxy S8 Scores the Highest on AnTuTu, Video Shows Android O Could Feature Notification Revamp and Picture-in-Picture Microsoft Loves iPhones: OneDrive App Updated with iMessage Support Say Goodbye to Another Microsoft App on Old Windows Phones    Google Assistant new android apps T-Mobile DIGITS APK: Updated March 18th, 20:47 GMT Sweet Selfie APK: Updated March 18th, 20:42 GMT Battery Doctor APK: Updated March 18th, 20:36 GMT 360 Battery Plus APK: Updated March 18th, 20:31 GMT Retrica APK: Updated March 18th, 20:26 GMT Adobe Photoshop Lightroom APK: Updated March 18th, 20:16 GMT LocalCast APK: Updated March 17th, 13:57 GMT Reader comments Samsung Galaxy S8 Event Posters and Stock Wallpapers Are Out more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.
