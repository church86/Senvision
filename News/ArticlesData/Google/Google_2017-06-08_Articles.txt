Google wants to make it easy for carriers to have interoperable RCS messaging Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/06/07 2:18pm PDTJun 7, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 174 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares261 Carriers Google News Last week Sprint and Rogers announced that users sending messages between the two carriers will be able to make use of RCS. RCS, of course, is the new standard to replace SMS that Google committed to back in 2015. So far each carrier seems to have its own idea for how RCS should work. But Google's recent work in cross-carrier communication is a big step towards ubiquity, and thanks to the tech behind this latest interconnect other carriers can more easily get in on the RCS action. We are deploying a "hub" model, so that carriers can interconnect to the hub once to get access to all other carriers connected to the hub. — Nick Fox (@RealNickFox) June 5, 2017 Google's Nick Fox followed up his announcement on the 1st with an answer to a question posed by our own Artem about how Google's RCS interconnect works. Instead of requiring that carriers individually connect their networks in some capacity to one another to exchange RCS messages, the RCS standards used by Google and the GSMA make use of a hub-style interconnect. Google's hub-based implementation of RCS in the recent cross-carrier announcement isn't a new technology, but it is cool. Back in 2013, the GSM Association published a white paper that detailed how RCS could work — and it's very much worth a read if you are even mildly interested in the future of carrier messaging, RCS, or even just networking. The white paper showed a few different methods for RCS implementation, such as using a direct NNI (Network-Network Interface) decentralized network for each carrier interconnection. Unfortunately, that particular solution results in a quickly rising number of interconnects as the number of carriers increases (n(n - 1) / 2), which means for each additional carrier in the network a larger investment needs to be made by those in it. The white paper also talked about a hub model for RCS, which has clear advantages for carriers. Rather than be burdened with developing their own connections to other carriers, each needs only connect to the one central hub presumably provided by Google. But, this centralized system will likely suffer from the same sort of weaknesses that all centralized systems do. For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. A central network is also more susceptible to censorship, attacks, or interference. However, it also provides some advantages, such as decreasing the investment of time and resources for carriers joining the standard. 4 node interconnect vs 36 The hub system proposed in the white paper (based on Openmind Networks implementation for SMS/MMS) does have drawbacks, but fewer connections might end up meaning faster deployment. And since Google has already done the work bringing the hub network up for Sprint and Rogers, each additional carrier should only responsible for its connection to that hub, as opposed to managing every link to every other RCS carrier themselves. Perhaps the recent news might help other carriers be persuaded to adopt Google's version of RCS, if for no other reason than cost-cutting. Why manage a ton of different networks for RCS when they can let Google cough up the cash for infrastructure? After all, if there's one thing carriers love, it's money.

Release 2 of the RCS universal profile which is to contain the needed information for third-party apps (Like Textra) to utilize RCS features will be released very soon. http://i.imgur.com/HLbSwcy.jpg https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ns9oV0Dh8_S5M-JHDvJ8sNHR6rpbiq2N6qZlP3g9zQ/edit Ryne Hager The beauty of that document makes me feel bad about my Google Docs skills. Jayson Stephenson Trust me, it wasn't anywhere that great to begin with. I really learned a lot with this doc and the amazing features/flexibility that G-Drive has. Snowsky Mountain Does this mean I can use third-party apps like the SMS Backup & Restore app to backup and restore RCS messages? Jayson Stephenson Yes, but even better. RCS Messages are by default synced to your carriers cloud infrastructure. So if you were to change phones/tablets your messages will be in sync with whatever device you use. Snowsky Mountain Where would I go to turn off/on that syncing of messages? Would it be from a messaging app, like the Android Messages app? Or would it be through my carrier? Also, I wonder what (if any) effect that would have on T-Mobile's DIGITS service, which appears to do something similar for SMS/MMS messages... Jayson Stephenson I'm not 100% yet. But I believe your answer might be on what Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en MJ I have no interest in my carrier storing my messages. No thanks... I hope this can be turned off. Jayson Stephenson I'm sure a lot of people will agree with you. As I mentioned to Snowsky, I believe the option for that will be on whatever Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en Latheryin There goes your privacy. Dmitri Smirnov There was never any to begin with in the SMS world. Latheryin That completely is a matter of the country to live in. Dmitri Smirnov SS7 vulnerabilities prove, that lack of privacy transcends borders :) Also, there is nothing preventing your carrier to store the SMS "for technical reasons" regardless of a country. At any rate, while RCS might be a weird attempt to catch up with the messenger market, it is definitely not worse than the SMS. Latheryin Acutally there is. At least in the states. There are laws that prevent them from being more then a pass through. As for the messaging market. That also depends on the country you live in. Data messengers are bigger in developing countries then they are say in the states. A perfect example is that 3% of the US population even use a messaging app as their primary. SMS or just flat out calling is the preffered. David Ruddock Cool doc, but Verizon and AT&T are both signatories on the RCS Universal Profile. That doesn't compel them to do anything, but it seems unlikely they'd sign if they didn't intend to be compatible with the universal profile at some point, which is what Google Jibe is based on. Jayson Stephenson It doesn't say anywhere they they ever will implement it. In fact I expect they won't for a long time. All it mentions is their RCS is a proprietary format meaning it will work on only their internal networks. Also check out my comment on AT&T. newtonfb ATT showed a demo of it at MWC(I see that you made that comment on the doc, you should include the twitter picture also). I dont see why ATT and Tmobile will not have the UP out by the end of the year. Verizon is a different story as they have not showed or said anything about it. Jayson Stephenson The doc is open source. ;) Latheryin Yes attached showed it but it plans on placing it on top of their SMS setup not as a replacement. wicketr I think what he's saying is that "yes, it's proprietary now, but they planning on having UP with an unconfirmed launch date". The same is true for most of these. T-Mobile's is currently proprietary, but has been rumored to be UP completed by the end of the year. But it's undetermined if it's going to use Google's hub, or implement the RCS UP using Samsung's infratructure across the boards. Jayson Stephenson Yes, sorry for the confusion. I will see if I can design it any better. But so far the only carrier which we know guaranteed is in the process of installing the UP is T-Mobile. Which is mentioned in the doc. Tom Erlandsen Calling it now, I bet Allo gets RCS support fairly soon after this release Joshua Why? Android Messages - which has RCS - is made by Google. They could have implemented RCS into Allo this whole time. Tom Erlandsen Because Google wants Allo to succeed, and the absolute best way they can do that is by having some kind of carrier messaging fallback. They're not going to do SMS fallback, the Allo lead has come out and said that before. But they've never said they won't do RCS fallback. And the fact that Android Messages has RCS support means absolutely nothing. Google is infamous for its A/B tests, so it's hardly a stretch to imagine them having two apps with RCS support. If Allo with RCS fallback proves very popular and successful, I could imagine them discontinuing Android Messages and making Allo with RCS the default messaging app on Android, requiring OEMs to bundle it with their devices. But I only think they'll do that if Allo proves to be a success, as otherwise they'll face massive OEM backlash Joshua They wont discontinue Android Messages because here in Canada where RCS has been out for months, carriers have said in 2018 Android Messages is shipping with all of their devices. Tom Erlandsen Like I said, I don't think they'd discontinue Android Messages unless Allo was poised to take its place (i.e. had a decent userbase). And that would take a while to happen, even with RCS support. So yeah Android Messages will probably stay for a while, until Google has something it feels would make a better replacement, and I think that's what they'll try and build Allo into Jayson Stephenson You have a very similar theory as I do. I think the point of the renaming of Google Messages to "Android Messages" is to give all AOSP devices a baseline messenger app that is not branded with the Google name, and supports whatever standard your carrier utilizes. (SMS/MMS/RCS) Obviously Allo will not be getting full-SMS support at all for obvious reasons....(https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/53uvvu/why_sms_fallback_isnt_the_holy_grail_you_all/) But it might be possible for it to get RCS support and still allowing it to view, send, and receive SMS messages. As SMS messages are connected to your carriers data infrastructure instead of tied to your phone storage. (If you have an RCS compatible carrier) You can have Allo to communicate to any non-Allo contacts while still utilizing its rich features with Allo-Allo communication. Although I'm not sure if such an app/feature is even possible. If it were, we could see a messenger revolution! Abraham No this is how I see it. Android Messages is a very generic simple SMS/RCS platform. No real branding, no real benefit for Google. This makes carriers happy as they are not shoving Google on everyones faces by default. Allo, if it gets RCS support. Will be the Google branded, with Google assistant and many more things. But this will be for the user to decide if they want to use. Not set as default to keep the user and carriers happy. What do you guys think? Joshua More likely. Allo will never replace Android Messages. Android Messages is a very lightweight, clean, and basic app. Allo is full of many (some might call pointless) features most don't want or need. Allo is slow to open compared to Android Messages, which could get annoying if you just want to send a quick SMS/RCS message. McStagger are you keeping that spreadsheet updated? Jayson Stephenson Most certainly! .w oh, and google will be in the center of our communication even more! and if someone opts to use basic sms, which doesn't use internet and such one will end up being processed but damn google... how "noble" of them, and they will probably do this also for "free" (i.e. "only" our data will be collected)... 😆😄 Better Google than Amazon, Facebook, or Apple. That's for sure. .w I'm not so sure about that, given google cluster-freck attitude towards messaging apps... None of the above looks great tbh... Nana Adu-Krow Not sure what is so hard to understand about their messaging apps. Each one serves a different purpose. And if you feel like there's apps that lack certain functionality (like web app support or something) you have the option to use something 3rd party. .w ROTFL, I didn't say that it's hard to understand but the purpose of messaging app is, well... messaging. In case of google you have abundance of messaging apps and if they have distinctive functionality it's even worse - there should be single app that handles all the basics and does it well. That's not the case in google messaging ecosystem. Why would I put my feet in that mess? Just to find out that in a couple of months google would introduce yet another messaging app? or in case of operators - say that they were mistaken if not 100% chooses their solution. Bottomline - trusting google services, especially those not well established (like mail, calendar, docs or android ecosystem) is veeeery risky... Cakefish When will RCS come to the UK? NathanDrago My knowledge is that SMS have basically disappeared. I only receive SMS from my bank and my carrier. Everybody is using WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it. What's the purpose of this effort for RCS? Is RCS more capable than WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it? David Ruddock SMS is still widely used in the USA. NathanDrago But don't you suspect that by the time this standard even starts to spread, USA will already have caught up with the rest of the world (that is, abandoning non-data messages)? It seems to me a lot of wasted resources. raddacle Considering how comfortable people are with services like iMessage which discriminates against other OS's, I don't see SMS going anywhere for the US. SMS is as standard as possible for the US right now. The only way to change the standard is by forcing it, hence RCS. Santos Chavez iMessage says nope, sorry. iPhones are actually a lot more popular here in the USA than the rest of the world. Hence people never switch to other apps.Hence those iPhone users messaging an Android user and oops, it's an SMS now because, yeah, Android doesn't have iMessage. The Android user also wouldn't change apps either if their current SMS app allows them to chat with all of their iPhone using friends. Like me, for instance, I'm the only one in my group of 5 friends that uses an Android phone. Hence, my default SMS app, Android Messages,is all I need to talk with them. They don't switch apps because amongst themselves they use iMessage which is enough as they get advanced messaging features. See what I mean? RCS would at the very least make Android---> Android users have those same advanced messaging features they'd get with other apps. Pushing RCS as the standard works for us here because we've never switched out of using SMS apps. .w This highly depends on the country... Peter Obligatory XKCD https://m.xkcd.com/927/ Dat Nguyen Here in Belgium, SMS is still used (well less than before) because when it comes to mobile subscriptions, Belgium is one of the countries that has expensive prices. For example, for 15€ a month, the carrier I use gives you 2,5 hours of calling, unlimited texting and 1,5 Gb of data so it's not like I can enable the data 24/7 And none of the carriers in Belgium doesn't seem to be aware of RCS AbdulB1 keep it on 3g. You will survive within limits Ryne Hager RCS is supposed to be an open replacement for SMS/MMS. But it is really just another competing standard. At least when compared to things like WhatsApp it isn't a private system. Any carrier that wants to can jump on and start using RCS for messaging, while WhatsApp is not so open and requires that you use their app the way they want you to. So TL:DR RCS is just supposed to replace old standards. bekifft Obligatory XKCD: https://xkcd.com/927/ Latheryin Data only messaging services are not really used a lot in the states and many other places. Data rates are just too high where SMS is unlimited free. Kyle Salewski Really hoping that since Google is behind this, and with the recent revamp of Google Voice, that RCS would soon come to GV. Anyone have any insight on the complexity behind that? Or would it be really difficult since Google Voice isn't a traditional "carrier" but more of a middle man. David Ruddock It would make sense as a reason for them bringing it back from the brink of death, if nothing else. bekifft But Google Voice / Hangouts are the core of the Frankenstein monster that is Google Fi. They seem to be trying to kill both brands, so it makes more sense to do this as part of Google Fi. But maybe GV / GFi is just more A / B testing. Willie Chalmers III More like A/B/C/D/E testing for a messaging strategy. Santos Chavez I think Nick Fox also mentioned on Twitter that they're working on bringing RCS to Project Fi. Project Fi uses Google Voice as the back end for most of its functions so perhaps adding RCS to Voice is pretty much necessary for it to come to Fi-- maybe they'll "talk" to the same server, as such. Project Fi numbers are Google Voice numbers after all, technically. Snowsky Mountain Is an Internet connection required to send and receive RCS messages? Jay Yes. h4rr4r So then why bother with it over XMPP? Snowsky Mountain So what would happen if I had a cellular connection but no Internet (no Wi-Fi or data)? Would it fall back to SMS/MMS? Jay Yep, you got it! John Doe VoLTE? Phone service requires Internet now so why not messages? Evan Anderson For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. This is an extremely unlikely situation. Any large network system, such as this one, will have plenty of redundancy and excess capacity to avoid ever overloading the system. Star network topology is standard these days, so this architecture makes perfect sense. Any other topology is highly inefficient. Snowsky Mountain I wonder what would happen if that were to occur, though. Maybe it would fall back to SMS/MMS? Ryne Hager It's definitely unlikely, I'm more concerned about denial of service implications from a centralized system. Decentralized might be more expensive for the carriers, but it would be more robust. Houston Texas Robust how? Borgman Say Android Messages gets RCS on all carriers and stuff. What then will be the incentive to use Allo or other IM? Sruly J Well Allo has bots... Marcellus1 It'll be the particular feature set of each offering. I could use Allo because I like the bot and you could use WhatsApp because you like the stickers, for example, but it wouldn't matter that we aren't using the same app--which would be awesome and would drive competition better. Borgman But Allo won't get RCS, correct? Won't that remain an IM (unfortunately?). Or by some miracle (thanks to RCS) I'd be able to use Allo and message someone on imessage? Or are IM a whole nother story for a later date? (I just wish I could use X app and send messages, full resolution photos, HD video, read receipt, typing notify, to someone on Y app). Marcellus1 I don't know specifically what apps will get RCS and what ones won't. Hopefully all messaging apps will support it at some point. I suspect if there are any holdouts, iMessage would be the main one just because Apple likes to be intentionally incompatible. The goal of RCS, though, is to have exactly what you said is your wish. Borgman Man I sure hope that happens!!! Latheryin Will never take off as the standard. Not for a least 10 years. Joshua Canada already has had RCS for many months. We only have a few carriers, so it can easily be standard in Canada. Latheryin Everywhere has it. It is just a matter of who will be using it and what version they will use. It will end up like Android pay.. It to mention that is a but too much privacy that many people just will not freely Give up. Mainly not with the anti Google movement going on right now. Marty For some reason the headline of this article made me remember what I used to think about Google several years ago. I was of the opinion that the mentality at Google was of forging a future of making everything free...at least free in the phone and service market to start. Back then my impression of Google was that it was lead by activistic, hippy-culture young people who wanted everything in life to be free. I felt Google would try to lead society to forge such a mindset that "profit" was evil and that humanity being free from wants and needs was the future they wanted. Viktor Ivanov Good thing they aren't, I'd be really worried if they were. Marty Maybe they were to a certain extent but couldn't manage to bring their ideals to fruition. The people running the show right now seem to be money-driven. Syukri Lajin Google trying to make the carriers move to a more centralized system. Good thing they showed good example by not making another messaging app just for RCS. :D freshprince_87 I hope the other 3 US carriers (T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T) adopts Google's RCS messaging network so that RCS finally replaces SMS/MMS forever . SMS/MMS needs to freaking die already! When that happens, there won't be a need for iMessage and it's blue bubbles anymore 😒. Because every phone except for iPhones (unless Apples updates it's messages app in iOS 11)will have the Google's version of iMessage messaging service, RCS, in the United States. Borgman I don't know how many bozo iphone friends I have who say "the picture you just send is hazy" or "why does Android not send HD pics or videos". Drives me crazy! Just want a simple way to send those things to my friends! Warren Skipper No matter if the rest of the world uses RCS, Apple will never adopt it simply because it involves connecting to Google. Add on top of the fact that Google will likely have access to all messages that come through and you have a perfect recipe for Apple to publicly stand against it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson Not sure what you mean by "Connecting to Google", if Apple were to ever adopt RCS they would just have to utilize the exact same API's that every other OEM (Windows Phones, Android, etc...) uses. The only thing Google is doing is promoting the standard and trying to push adoption. Warren Skipper From everything I've read, there are some parts of the universal profile that seem to be Google-specific. In this article by Mobilesyrup, the carrier network Rogers stated “It’s a Google managed service”: http://mobilesyrup.com/2017/05/11/rcs-messaging-sms-canada-explainer/ I could be wrong though.Even if so, Apple wouldn't adopt it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson What he was mentioning in that paragraph that you quoted was the Google Jibe platform which those carriers have agreed to utilize to have Google host the server infrastructure for them. Look at the previous paragraph... "One point Sarhangi is quick to reiterate multiple times throughout our interview is that RCS “is not a Google service.”" RCS is NOT a Google exclusive service. Any Carrier, or OS, or Hardware manufacturer can utilize RCS 100% without any involvement of Google whatsoever. Warren Skipper You're mistaken what I'm saying. I know this is not Google exclusive. I also understand that any carrier can implement it along with OEMs like Samsung who can host the servers in lieu of Google. However, it's highly likely that Google has some form of code within the universal profile itself, that they can track, that is beyond whoever implements RCS. Again I could be wrong but either way, RCS has to go through someone's servers and who's ever it is will have the ability to mine everything that goes through it. Nicholas Conrad But apple hates industry standard, it interferes with their platform lock-in. mrjayviper Did that mean SMS communications will be data mined by Google as well? I believe they can't do that right now? h4rr4r Why not? They can read anything the device sends. If you own the kernel you own it all. mrjayviper Google can't read my SMS right now success they are not part of the process Ryan yes, they can. as he said they can technically read anything that exits your phone, if they choose to do so. This is how the current sms backup function works. Also if you use android messages they are already in the process mrjayviper i don't backup my SMS h4rr4r Google made the software that displays the text. If you use an Android phone. eddiepearson Honestly, don't care about this unless this means TMO will implement this tomorrow. All of this is null if TMO continues to not give a crap. You can get those free poop goodies every Tuesday though. bekifft The Venn diagram of people on Sprint with friends in Canada (and vice versa) are going to be very excited about this! JD So what Google is saying is RCS will be an unreliable POS that will be in Beta forever. Santos Chavez No that is not at all what they're saying. thecoolkid So now Google will be reading our texts too...? kamiller42 Control the hub? Control the world! Nice one, stop shop for intelligence agencies. Will hub participants be given access to all traffic on the hub? I'm sure Google will. "Better to mine you with my pretty!" MeCampbell30 I'm sure the carriers have no intention of letting google profit at their expense. kamiller42 The answer? Enticement. Offer the carriers the access to the products of the data mining. "We all benefit." Abhishek Saral RCS is just for SMS or are there any other benefits? senoredusty Separate ideas. Your question doesn't really make sense. Think of RCS ad the evolution of SMS Abhishek Saral Try to understand the context. It's just for sending messages or something else. senoredusty Yes. It's like fancy SMS. Read receipts, higher quality media, typing indicators, etc. Abhishek Saral People in US should start using WhatsApp already. Instead of making things tough for everyone. senoredusty Everyone in the US uses SMS already. If, over the course of time, people are naturally transitioned from SMS to RCS, that's a lot smaller a barrier than trying to convince each and every person to install yet another app. Sprint is going in the right direction with this, having Android Messages installed by default on all new Android devices. Also IMO WhatsApp is ugly. I don't want to use it, so I'm not about to try to convince everyone else they should. I'd much rather see Textra gain RCS functionality. Duder12 Fixed for you. *iPhone users in US should stop using iMessage already. Instead of making things tough for everyone.* Jay Who care? Americans have locked themselves into a vicious cycle, where 'SMS FALLBACK' in 2017 is necessary and their own self created injury infliction about being the 'green text' to 'blue text' users. Be it whatsapp or telegram or wechat, the rest of the world seems a lot more sane and the messaging discussion has not been one, in a lot of places on earth for years now. Instead here we are in 2017, with americans ranting about SMS and 'the imessage for android'. Something most nations will not care about Santos Chavez I think a lot of has to do with the fact that many folks here aren't really technically knowledged. Most never use any other app other than what came with their phone. Hence why SMS is still a thing, they just use that app to communicate with everyone. By gradually moving things over to RCS, those same consumers would still benefit from advanced messaging even if they never change their app. Sprint is helping with that since they're installing Android Messages by default on all new phones, and they already support RCS. ThePublisher So Google will be able to read all texts... awesome... Erstam Why don't they have Google voice setup with this already? James Where does it say Jibe will provide the hub connection to carriers for free? davidtb I could see how Google (a non-carrier) would want a piece of every RCS message (via their servers) who's at the center of the hub? RCS is pretty, but not a necessity, needa I wonder if Google is going to let everyone in the hub get the data. Yuri Vidal Can someone please explain me why use RCS (Or even SMS) would be better than simply using internet IP messaging systems? (WhatsApp, Telegram, Hangout, and so many others...) Paul Hansen A universal platform for all mobile devices. Not just the ones with a particular app installed. Santos Chavez Because then you could message someone the same way as those apps, but it wouldn't even matter what app they're using. For example, SMS apps will adopt the standard, as well (Textra devs have already said they will support it) so an Android Messages user on Sprint would be able to RCS with a Textra user on Rogers while having the same exact features of WhatsApp, Facebook, etc (like read receipts, typing indicators, large video sending, high quality pictures, and so on). Believe it or not, not everyone uses those other apps, especially here in the US. And even if they had an account in one or more of the apps, they may not be active on it anymore, like it is the case with my friends. With RCS you'd still be able to reach them anyway and have all of the advanced features those apps provide, across carriers and across apps. 2 Men-E I just want this to come to Project Fi Santos Chavez Me too! Really hoping that because Google owns the infrastructure and that they've streamlined the requirements to bridge to other carriers, it'll come to Fi pretty soon. Should be lots easier for them than all of the other carriers anywhere, after all :P Sonic Sunglasses I'm sure AT$T is busy working out its strategic plan to be dead last in implementing this technology. KChristainsen So basically we're still far off from RCS becoming a reality, unreal Jeff Saul Everything goes through the Google. It has been decreed. Humans will bow down to the Google. The Google reigns supreme. Soraya Xel For Google's next trick: Steal everyone's SMS data too. xyz No big deal. In most countries, the telecom regulators will set a standard that all carriers will have to follow. In the US, it'll be a mess. Đức Thành This is always the case: Google wants to help make something better for everyone, they have an idea that can help people improve things for themselves, which then more often than not gets rejected because everyone is a selfish and foolish asshole whose only interest is their own short-term benefits. Much of humanity is like that. Sometimes I think I can begin to get why in sci-fi movies the supreme AI ruler just wants to get rid of all humanity: Humanity's stupidity is a threat to their very existence.

Chrome Beta 60 adds new search widget, limits the Vibration API to combat malware ads, and more [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 8:10pm PDTJun 8, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 35 Share on Twitter Total Shares121 Applications Google News Article Contents 1 New search widget 2 No more vibrating ads 3 New context menu 4 New file picker 5 Other features 6 APK Download Chrome 59 was just released, which means Chrome 60 has graduated to beta status. This version includes a few interface changes, like a new context menu and file picker, as well as a new search widget. The Vibration API also has some new limitations to combat malware ads. Let's take a look. New search widget We previously covered Chrome's new search widget, which was developed as a result of an anti-trust lawsuit Russia. Russian search company Yandex claimed that Google violated local competition rules, and the settlement required Google to develop a search widget that could change between search engines. At some point, this will replace the normal Google search widget for Android phones sold in Russia. It uses whatever search engine you have set in Chrome, and starting with version 57, Chrome supports almost any search engine you could want to use. It doesn't appear to have changed since we covered it in Chrome Dev 60. No more vibrating ads You've probably seen those fake full-screen malware ads before - the ones that vibrate your phone. This is possible thanks to the Vibration API introduced a few years ago. I'm sure someone thought that web games would be pretty cool with if they could vibrate your phone, but I've only ever seen it used by malicious advertisements. Starting with Chrome 60, pages will no longer be able to vibrate your device unless you tap on the page first. I still think the Vibration API should be removed entirely, or at least have to ask the user permission first (like camera access), but this is a step in the right direction. In a similar move, the beforeunload JavasScript function will only work if you have tapped on the page. This is also commonly used by malicious advertisements, to show an alert as you try to close the window/tab. New context menu If you're not aware, the 'context menu' is the name of the menu that appears when you long-press a link or image in Chrome for Android. Chrome 60 includes a fancy new context menu, but for now, it's disabled by default. You can turn it on by switching the #enable-custom-context-menu flag to 'Enabled.' So what's so great about this new menu? Not only does it have helpful icons next to each menu item, it has a tabbed interface if you select an image contained in a link. Take a look at the below screenshots:     From left to right: link and linked image in Chrome 59, link and linked image in Chrome 60 There aren't any new menu items, everything just looks cleaner. I like it. New file picker The context menu isn't the only interface element to get a facelift in Chrome 60. There's also a new photo/file picker, which appears when you try to upload a file to a webpage. Just like the context menu, this is hidden behind the #enable-new-photo-picker flag, and must be turned on manually (for now).   Left: File picker on Chrome 59; Right: File picker on Chrome 60 You can tell this is a bit unfinished - I imagine recent photos are supposed to appear on the new popup. Still, it's already an improvement from Chrome 59's picker. Other features As with every Chrome release, Chrome 60 includes several smaller changes that may go unnoticed by most users and/or developers. Here are a few of them: Google previously added support for the paymentRequest API to Chrome, which allowed sites to checkout using Android Pay on Android (I still haven't seen a real site that does this). This will be extended to other payment apps starting with Chrome 60, but apps have to add support for the API. Several non-standard animation functions, like WEBKIT_KEYFRAMES_RULE and WebKitTransitionEvent, have been removed. The WebUSB API is now enabled by default. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Thanks, Google Chrome team. Peter You can enable the VibrationAPI changes in Chrome 59 via a flag which is handy. chrome://flags/#vibrate-requires-user-gesture Also same for the new file picker, although it seems quite broken. Launch the file picker, close it, then try to launch it again and it often doesn't work. YMMV. Sruly J I don't really deal with vibrating ads anymore (very rarely), but I'm more thrilled with this change than how Artem feels when he can go a week without experiencing #artemsluck. Jay It's amazing that those spammy malware sites have managed to avoid destruction for so long. I can't wait for the day.. Syukri Lajin I have never seen any website that uses the vibration API except for malwares. Until now, I thought they were using some kind of hack to get the phone vibrating. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I've only seen it used by ads. Oktawiusz Wieczorek I think sites like Facebook use the API for the notifications. So it is not entirely useless. Gotmilo greatly needed .. especially since androidpolice blocked adblockers for their websites and i'm still getting popup ads with vibrations.... Jay Even if you've got acceptable ads enabled? needa I don't, and I never do. With or without adblocker. This site is pretty clean. You must have something else going on. On a side note. I started using Fair Adblocker last night. It gives you the standard google adverts, which you can tell it how many you want to see, and gets rid of the rest. You can even selectively get rid of things if you want. I also don't get the popup asking me to give them two cents a view. Nate Is the app shortcut for "New incognito tab" missing for anyone else? It's been gone for a while for me. boop ;) I've always had it.

Carson Saldanha Why is there always two camera icons in the file picker menu? abqnm That search bar doesn't so much as search using the search engine in Chrome as it does just open a quick overlay of the Chrome omnibox on the screen. And it's incredibly awesome. It makes it one tap to open chrome, focus on the omnibox and launch the keyboard. And it's quite fast. bass-ackwards Word to the wise, use Samsung browser, it blows chrome out the water. And I used to use nothing but chrome after experimenting with all the others. Samsung browser is by far the best PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The Vibration API This was idiotic to ever have been added. Teja I want to login to sites using my fingerprint on Chrome.

We knew that Masayoshi Son, founder and CEO of telecom giant SoftBank, loved robots. Now the Japanese billionaire is about to significantly expand his collection. Minutes ago, SoftBank announced that it will be acquiring Boston Dynamics and Schaft from Google parent Alphabet for an undisclosed sum, in order to “collaborate in advancing the development of smart robotics technologies.” Boston Dynamics and Schaft were two of the nine robot companies that Google bought in 2013 to form the core of its robotics division, headed by Android founder Andy Rubin. As far as anyone could tell, not much happened after all those companies became part of Google, and not much continued to happen through 2016, much to the frustration of roboticists everywhere. Boston Dynamics, led by legendary robot builder Marc Raibert, just kept on doing its own awesome thing, unveiling ever more agile and capable quadrupeds and humanoids, and Schaft, founded by a team of University of Tokyo engineers, quietly improved its bipedal robots, with a surprise sneak peak at a new dual-legged machine last April. As Google’s robotics group (eventually swallowed up by Alphabet’s advanced tech division X) continued to not produce all that much and began slowly losing talent, the rumors were that Boston Dynamics in particular was looking for a new owner, and they’ve finally found one, in SoftBank. Here’s the press release, which sadly will not tell you all that much more than our headline: SoftBank Group Corp. today announced a subsidiary of SoftBank has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics from Alphabet Inc. The transaction aligns with SoftBank’s investments in paradigm-shifting technologies and its vision of catalyzing the next wave of smart robotics. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Masayoshi Son, Chairman & CEO of SoftBank Group Corp., said, “Today, there are many issues we still cannot solve by ourselves with human capabilities. Smart robotics are going to be a key driver of the next stage of the Information Revolution, and Marc and his team at Boston Dynamics are the clear technology leaders in advanced dynamic robots. I am thrilled to welcome them to the SoftBank family and look forward to supporting them as they continue to advance the field of robotics and explore applications that can help make life easier, safer and more fulfilling.” Marc Raibert, CEO and founder of Boston Dynamics, said, “We at Boston Dynamics are excited to be part of SoftBank’s bold vision and its position creating the next technology revolution, and we share SoftBank’s belief that advances in technology should be for the benefit of humanity. We look forward to working with SoftBank in our mission to push the boundaries of what advanced robots can do and to create useful applications in a smarter and more connected world.” As part of the transaction with Alphabet, SoftBank has also agreed to acquire Japanese bipedal robotics company Schaft. Founded in 2012 in the JSK Robotics Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, the company has continued its pioneering work under the leadership of co-founders Yuto Nakanishi, Junichi Urata, Narito Suzuki and Koichi Nishiwaki. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. SoftBank entered the robotics market with its $100+ million acquisition of French company Aldebaran Robotics in 2012. Aldebaran, makers of Nao and Romeo, was immediately tasked with creating Pepper, which (as far as we can tell) is a social robot that’s still trying to figure out exactly how to become commercially viable as much more than a novelty. What we do know for sure is that SoftBank suddenly has an alarming amount of robotics talent and tech at its disposal—either it’s all going to get sucked up into a corporate void and never heard from again, or something truly amazing is going to come out of this new partnership More recently, Softbank invested $20 million in Fetch Robotics, which makes mobile robots for warehouse fulfillment as well as a mobile manipulator that (they hope) will soon transition from research platform to a robot that can pick objects off of shelves. While as far as we know neither Boston Dynamics nor Schaft have robots with much in the way of near-term commercial potential, what these companies have in common is that they’re developing capable physical platforms backed by reliable software with an eye towards performing useful tasks outside of structured environments. Yes, our imaginations are running wild, although our expectation is that we’ll be seeing things that are bipedal and dynamic (and, um, social?). We’re also wondering to what extent SoftBank is going to leave these groups alone to do what they do best (making awesome robots just for the heck of it), or whether SoftBank expects tangible, near-term contributions towards some specific project. It’s also unclear how much collaboration (if any) there will be between Boston Dynamics, which is based in Waltham, Mass., and Schaft, based near Tokyo, or with the other robotics stuff that SoftBank has going on in Japan, France, and the United States. What we do know for sure is that SoftBank suddenly has an alarming amount of talent and tech at its disposal—either it’s all going to get sucked up into a corporate void and never heard from again, or something truly amazing is going to come out of this new partnership. We’re hoping for the latter, and we’ll keep you updated as we learn more.

Those findings from DeepMind, the pioneering London-based AI lab, also suggest the motive behind why DeepMind has created a huge new dataset of YouTube clips to help train AI on identifying human actions in videos that go well beyond “Mmm, doughnuts” or “Doh!” The most popular AI used by Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other companies beyond Silicon Valley is based on deep learning algorithms that can learn to identify patterns in huge amounts of data. Over time, such algorithms can become much better at a wide variety of tasks such as translating between English and Chinese for Google Translate or automatically recognizing the faces of friends in Facebook photos. But even the most finely tuned deep learning relies on having lots of quality data to learn from. To help improve AI’s capability to recognize human actions in motion, DeepMind has unveiled its Kinetics dataset consisting of 300,000 video clips and 400 human action classes. “AI systems are now very good at recognizing objects in images, but still have trouble making sense of videos,” says a DeepMind spokesperson. “One of the main reasons for this is that the research community has so far lacked a large, high-quality video dataset.” DeepMind enlisted the help of online workers through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service to help correctly identify and label the actions in thousands of YouTube clips. Each of the 400 human action classes in the Kinetics dataset has at least 400 video clips, with each clip lasting around 10 seconds and taken from separate YouTube videos. More details can be found in a DeepMind paper on the arXiv preprint server. The new Kinetics dataset seems likely to represent a new benchmark for training datasets intended to improve AI computer vision for video. It has far more video clips and action classes than the HMDB-51 and UCF-101 datasets that previously formed the benchmarks for the research community. DeepMind also made a point of ensuring it had a diverse dataset—one that did not include multiple clips from the same YouTube videos. Tech giants such as Google—a sister company to DeepMind under the umbrella Alphabet group—arguably have the best access to large amounts of video data that could prove helpful in training AI. Alphabet’s ownership of YouTube, the incredibly popular, online, video-streaming service, does not hurt either. But other companies and independent research groups must rely on publicly available datasets to train their deep learning algorithms. Early training and testing with the Kinetics dataset showed some intriguing results. For example, deep learning algorithms showed accuracies of 80 percent or greater in classifying actions such as “playing tennis,” “crawling baby,” “presenting weather forecast,” “cutting watermelon,” and “bowling.” But the classification accuracy dropped to around 20 percent or less for the Homer Simpson actions, including slapping and headbutting, and an assortment of other actions such as “making a cake,” “tossing coin” and “fixing hair.” AI faces special challenges with classifying actions such as eating because it may not be able to accurately identify the specific food being consumed—especially if the hot dog or burger is already partially consumed or appears very small within the overall video. Dancing classes and actions focused on a specific part of the body can also prove tricky. Some actions also occur fairly quickly and are only visible for a small number of frames within a video clip, according to a DeepMind spokesperson. DeepMind also wanted to see if the new Kinetics dataset has enough gender balance to allow for accurate AI training. Past cases have shown how imbalanced training datasets can lead to deep learning algorithms performing worse at recognizing the faces of certain ethnic groups. Researchers have also shown how such algorithms can pick up gender and racial biases from language. A preliminary study showed that the new Kinetics dataset seems to fairly balanced. DeepMind researchers found that no single gender dominated within 340 out of the 400 action classes—or else it was not possible to determine gender in those actions. Those action classes that did end up gender imbalanced included YouTube clips of actions such as “shaving beard” or “dunking basketball” (mostly male) and “filling eyebrows” or “cheerleading” (mostly female). But even action classes that had gender imbalance did not show much evidence of “classifier bias.” This means that even the Kinetics action classes featuring mostly male participants—such as “playing poker” or “hammer throw”—did not seem to bias AI to the point where the deep learning algorithms had trouble recognizing female participants performing the same actions. DeepMind hopes that outside researchers can help suggest new human action classes for the Kinetics dataset. Any improvements may enable AI trained on Kinetics to better recognize both the most elegant of actions and the clumsier moments in videos that lead people to say “doh!” In turn, that could lead to new generations of computer software and robots with the capacity to recognize what all those crazy humans are doing on YouTube or in other video clips. “Video understanding represents a significant challenge for the research community, and we are in the very early stages with this,” according to the DeepMind spokesperson. “Any real-world applications are still a really long way off, but you can see potential in areas such as medicine, for example, aiding the diagnosis of heart problems in echocardiograms.” Learn More machine learning datasets YouTube DeepMind computer vision deep learning data science machine vision machine learning Comments Comment Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> Comments powered by Disqus Advertisement Tech Talk IEEE Spectrum’s general technology blog, featuring news, analysis, and opinions about engineering, consumer electronics, and technology and society, from the editorial staff and freelance contributors.

Google has announced the release of Chrome 59 for Android, which introduces some helpful new features and adds a few tweaks, including faster loading times. Chrome version 59.0.3071.92, which you can download here if it hasn’t already been pushed out to your device, uses an updated V8 JavaScript engine that helps web pages load quicker. Google says the speeds are up to 20 percent faster compared to previous versions of its mobile browser. And as the improved V8 engine is more efficient, it uses less memory, too. In April, Google said the JavaScript page loading improvements were due to the development of a new metric that better quantifies real-world usage. Chrome 59 also adds support for animated PNGs, known as APNGs. While they appear similar to GIFs, the format is of a slightly higher quality in that it supports 24-bit images and 8-bit transparency. Mozilla has supported it since Firefox 3, and Apple introduced APNGs in iMessages with iOS 10. The release contains standard performance and stability improvements, as well as a new image capture API that gives web pages more control over a device’s camera (only after the user grants permission, of course). Instead of just being able to take pictures, the new API allows pages to switch between detected cameras, use the flash, adjust the zoom, and focus the image. Finally, Chrome 59 for Android contains some minor security improvements. Pages that are embedded using iFrames, for example, are no longer allowed to send notifications.

That is the buzzword nowadays in the Silicon Valley. On June 5 at WWDC 2017 when Apple showed the new cool photography tricks that the iPhone will do with the iOS 11, it became clear why the computational photography is the next big thing as far as smartphones and cameras are concerned. It changes the game completely and in the last two odd years we have seen how it is making the phones like the iPhone 7 Plus and the Google Pixel the kind of shooters that can hold their own against proper cameras. But before we talk about the computational photography, let's talk about that magic trick that Apple showed on June 5. While demoing the new photo app in the iOS 11, Apple spokespersons talked about the time lapse feature. This is the kind of the feature that lets photographer clicks that light trail and silky white and extremely smooth running water with motion effect. It requires fiddling with aperture and shutter speed in cameras. It also requires a decent enough camera for the best results, with DSLR cameras often preferred. But Apple showed it can do the same photography with an iPhone, without fiddling with any knobs and dials. On the stage we saw that the time lapse feature was turned on the iPhone and it clicked a photo of waterfall that showed the water motion with silk smooth white stream. Just like that. Pure magic. Not for the first time The interesting bit is that this is not the first time Apple is doing something like this, creating an effect that would otherwise require expensive camera and lenses, with an iPhone. In fact, Apple is not even the only phone company doing it. Google too is big on the computational photography. We first saw the best example of it when Apple came out with the portrait mode in the iPhone 7 Plus. This mode allows a user to click portrait photos that have this creamy blurred background. and it works beautifully. In a proper DSLR camera the effect of blurred background is achieved using physics and light. It requires a lens with very wide aperture - F1.8 is better, F1.4 is fantastic - and with a combination of distance between the sensor and lens. Also the elements used inside the lens and the sensor size have an effect on this mode. Finally, there is the focal length. The higher the focal length, the better will be the blurred background aka bokeh. This is the reason why pro photographers use something like 105mm or 135mm lens with aperture of F2.8 or less to shoot portrait photos. There is lot of science involved here, lot of technology, and lot of skills. The iPhone 7 Plus does it all with just a toggle. Put the camera app in the portrait mode and shoot. And results are spectacular. so how does Apple manage something that requires a bulky camera with a small iPhone that has a tiny lens and tiny image sensor. Apple uses computational data. Apple doesn't rely on the physics of light to create the blurred background. It uses the data that camera sees, and computes a scene that would otherwise require expensive lens and a big bulky camera. It's not perfect all the time. It is definitely not as fine and natural looking as what a full-frame DSLR can manage. But the difference is minute. It is more than good enough for most consumers. Now the company is doing the same with the time lapse feature. it again is using the data collected by the tiny lens and making all those calculations using the powerful A10 processor to create a scene that is otherwise can only be clicked by a proper camera. Nowadays, everyone clicks photos with their phones. In fact, phones like the Google Pixel are even better than most entry-level cameras. In good light, these phones even match better cameras And Apple is hardly the only company doing it. Samsung is working on computational photography to make its cameras click better photos. Inside Google, which makes Pixel phones, there is this whole team that works on computational photography. It is this team that is behind the fantastic HDR mode in Pixel phones. Pixel phones have a small sensor compared to what you will inside a DSLR camera and yet it captures brilliant HDR. the sunset and sunrise photos clicked with the Pixel phones have amazingly clean shadows and brilliant colours. it's not because of the lens of the pixel or its image sensor - although that plays a role too - it is because Google's camera app issuing all those cool algorithms to compute a scene. It is probably filling in the data that is missing by recognising the patterns in the scene. It is using machine learning to probably make billions of calculations and figuring out the scene to recreate it digitally even if its lens can't capture all those brilliant rays of light the way a DSLR camera can do. Nikon and Canon should worry The interesting bit about the computational photography is that this is just beginning. In the last one year we have seen portrait mode and HDR getting better in the phones with the use of algorithms. Now Apple is adding another cool effect using it. Next you will see, phone companies will be figuring out the focus-related issues by using computation and not the light physics the way Canon or Nikon do. Then low light photography. Next the effects like starbursts. Who knows in future the computational photography may even figure out the problem of zoom and shutter speed. It is the digital world after all. This should make Canon and Nikon sit and take notice. Unfortunately, for now they remain oblivious to the risk, even though the entry-level camera market is almost gone. Nowadays, everyone clicks photos with their phones. In fact, phones like the Google Pixel are even better than most entry-level cameras. In good light, these phones even match better cameras. Yet, canon and Nikon continue to rely on their mastery of light, sensors and lights. But that won't be enough. they also need to start thinking about putting powerful computers inside their cameras, the way Apple and Google do in their phones. The Nikon and Canon cameras need to go beyond the Expeed and Digic. They need Snapdragons, Exynos and processor like the Apple A10 in their DSLR cameras. And they need to use these processors to make the cameras better, fill in the gaps, solve the problems that physics and light can't. Or else, in another five years DSLR cameras will look as irrelevant  as the compact cameras do right now. Also Read: iPhone 7 Plus camera can surpass a DSLR camera.

BY Sarah Jaffe Share TweetReddit0 StumbleUpon0EmailPrint Email this article to a friend your email your name recipient(s) email (comma separated) message captcha 'There was a dissonance between the voters and the messages that were coming out of the Democrats. There was this disconnect.' Welcome to Interviews for Resistance. Since election night 2016, the streets of the United States have rung with resistance. People all over the country have woken up with the conviction that they must do something to fight inequality in all its forms. But many are wondering what it is they can do. In this series, we'll be talking with experienced organizers, troublemakers and thinkers who have been doing the hard work of fighting for a long time. They'll be sharing their insights on what works, what doesn't, what’s changed and what is still the same. Becky Bond: I am Becky Bond. I was senior adviser on the Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign and, since the election of Trump, been in a lot of parts of the resistance, including co-founding a group called Knock Every Door. Sarah Jaffe: I want to talk about Knock Every Door. Tell us how that got started. Where did the idea come from and how did you end up putting it together? Becky: Like a lot of people that have been involved in organizing after the election of Trump, everyone I knew and people that I didn’t know, would come up to me and say, “What do we do now? What should I do?” It was kind of an amazing moment, in part because everybody wanted to do something and not only did they want to do something, it wasn’t just that they wanted to know where to give a donation or how to make a phone call, but they wanted to do things that were in person where they lived. They wanted to be with other people and they wanted to be active together in person, which was an amazing impulse. I, personally, felt that, too. I wanted to be with other people and I wanted to be engaged in work that was going to be part of the solution. One of the things I would tell people was that surely one of the next things that was going to happen was that we were going to start talking to the voters who had supported President Obama in 2008 and 2012 and who flipped to support Trump in 2016, as well as with the people who voted for President Obama in 2008 and 2012, but didn’t vote in 2016. Understanding what happened with those voters is going to be key in how were going to make things be different next time. We have got to get out there and knock on doors and talk to people and we have got to phone bank these people and start the conversation. I actually just really thought that most organizations that were involved in elections were going to basically start the work for the next cycle then because so many people were ready. They were like, “Let’s go! Let’s go canvas.” And then nobody asked them to do that. Nobody asked me to do that. So, even at the same time as all these new stories were coming out about the presidential campaign, which had really failed to talk to voters, at scale, in person with volunteers, there had been this idea on the campaign that that wasn’t a valuable or cost effective thing to do. One of the things that became clear, I think that the people who were asking me what to do next felt it very viscerally, was that somehow we lost this feedback loop between voters and the people who were running campaigns. If you had actually gone out and talked to people, like we did on the Bernie Sanders campaign across the country, you knew that people were really angry and hurting and that the solutions that the Democrats were talking about and were bragging about, “We fixed the economy. The economy is growing. It is awesome.” They were talking about the amazing advances of Obamacare, which did solve problems for a lot of people, but I would talk to people again and again across the country who said, “I am forced to pay expensive premiums that I can’t afford and my deductible is so high that I can’t go to the doctor when I am sick.” There was a dissonance between the voters and the messages that were coming out of the Democrats. There was this disconnect. There were a lot of people that were ready to go out and start having the conversations and to listen and try and forge the connections that we need and the civil dialogue that we need to get out of this hole. When that opportunity wasn’t offered, there were some other organizers that were feeling the same as I was and we all got together kind of as volunteers and we said, “Well, what if we could just help people go out and go canvassing? Why do we need a professional organization to run these canvasses and to invite people to do it?” We learned a lot on the Bernie Sanders campaign about how to use very cheap or free consumer software to help volunteers actually run their own voter contact operations. So that is when we decided that we would set an all-volunteer run, pretty much, campaign up that we called Knock Every Door. That was a series of conference calls and Google Docs and data entry teams and text message turnout teams and sort of bringing people together where they lived to go out and talk to voters. Sarah: It has been a few months now that this has been going on. How is it going? How many doors have been knocked? Where are people doing the door-knocking? Becky: It is amazing. Volunteers are running canvases in 37 states right now and they’ve knocked on tens of thousands of doors and they have had thousands of amazing conversations. And a lot of it is listening. What is so amazing about this moment that we are in and the really sort of humble and generous attitude of the volunteers who believe that we need to break out of filter bubbles and go talk to people that may not agree with us to try and understand, “What are the problems that they are facing? What are their hopes and fears for the future?” Then, how do we engage with them about our hopes and fears, especially if they are different? We have debriefing calls every week where the volunteers who hosted a conference get on one of these free conference calls with other people who have hosted and some of the organizers that were involved in the Bernie Sanders campaign, some of them were involved with the Clinton campaign and what they say is that people who show up and go out to canvass who have never done it before, not only are they having conversations that they think will make progress for the next election, but it is transforming them and how they feel about things. It is a really amazing personal experience for them to actually go out and relearn talking to people that are different than we are and sharing experiences. It has opened their eyes to the world in a certain way and it is creating a sense of connection that is missing. Sarah: What kinds of things are people learning on the doors? Becky: I think the thing that we are learning at the doors is that people actually want to talk. We worked with some political scientists to try and write scripts that would be most effective at the door that would also tap into a new kind of research about canvassing that suggests that a certain kind of, they call it deep canvassing, is actually the most impactful in terms of persuading people and having that persuasion be durable over time. We ask people at the end of the survey, “Would you like to have someone come back and talk to you about this again?” Overwhelmingly, people say “Yes,” they would. There is this myth that people don’t like to be bothered, that the voters don’t like to be bothered, that we are bothering them by going in and having conversations. One of the most amazing things that we are learning is that actually people do want to have these conversations with their fellow citizens about what is at stake and people really want to feel like they are listened to not just delivering a script and trying to tell somebody what they should think. Sarah: All of these conversation are happening, where does this go? Where does the information go? Where do the conversations lead? Becky: Right now what we are doing is if you are a volunteer and you want to start canvassing, when you go to the doors with your fellow volunteers, you pre-print out these forms where you can record the answers and what people say at the door. It is a combination of verbatims and picking on a scale of one to ten, “How do you feel about X or Y?” What they do after a canvass is there are these free apps you can put on your phone, and they turn the forms that they fill out into PDFs right there with their phone. Then, they email those forms in. Then, we have a team of a volunteers who actually enter the data into the database. Right now the data I think just goes into an air table just like on Google Sheets where we are tracking these responses. Then, we also send the Google spreadsheet back to the canvass organizer to give them that data back, because a lot of people when they are doing this have a small local group that is actually running a campaign that they look for candidates at times and they want the data back about the people that you talked to. So we are giving it back to the people that did it, but we are also keeping account of it. Right now, you think about how many people are doing this wherever they are, it is not concentrated in one area, so right now relative to the number of voters, it's a small database, but we are going to keep compiling it. And if enough people get involved, it will get large enough to be useful, at which point, what we say is that we are open to sharing the information with campaigns that are fighting for racial and economic justice. But, for now, we are just keeping information and putting it back in the hands of the people that are organizing on the ground. Sarah: It has been really interesting to me to see all of these new organizations or formations like Knock Every Door. There are a whole bunch of other things where it seems like you are doing basically what political parties in countries that have functional political parties would be doing. Especially in this vacuum of the Democratic Party not wanting to do some of these things, how do you feel about how all these different formations come together and what they’re building towards? Becky: I think, in some ways, what we are seeing are that people are just way out in front of the politicians and party leaders. With Knock Every Door, one of the things that we wanted to do was make a bold statement saying that this was really important and we need to show that volunteers actually really wanted to do it and to show that the voters at the doors actually want to be a part of the conversation. When we started this, there was no chair of the DNC and now we have people at the DNC talking very passionately about the need to go out, especially in an off year, and knock on every door. We have created a demand to knock every door and we are seeing the party start to talk about it. I think that is progress. Where we are actually seeing the party really get involved and really get involved with these volunteers is several state parties have come to us, where you have someone who works at the state party who went, “This is what I have been wanting to do is knock every door because our lists aren't great,” or “I know we could persuade people.” There are a lot of people that work at state parties who, especially in red states where there are counties where they don’t have staff on the ground in those counties because they just don’t have enough Democratic voters there. For them, this has been this great tool, this great platform where they can say, “I am going to run. I want help to run a Knock Every Door canvass in these counties in my state where we don’t have party staff.” We have been working with state parties about [how] they could get volunteers to start doing this work in places where they are not funded to do it. And really wanting to put this together as a platform and not as a campaign behind a specific idea. We already have ActBlue, which really revolutionized how people can raise small dollar donations to candidates without ever having to talk to staff or not having to rely on a group like the DNC or the DCCC to promote a candidate. We thought, in the same way, what if people could contribute small amounts of doors knocked to a larger strategy and create a platform that would let anybody plug into it and get started and with the hope that like ActBlue, which started slowly but has eventually become this really important part of the infrastructure of the Democratic Party and progressive movements, that setting up a platform where volunteers could be canvassing could really change things. Then finally, this is important too, is that we are turning people on to canvassing and once people start going door-to-door and talking to people, it is pretty addictive. What you find is that people that do it, some of them really get into and do it a lot. It is the kind of the thing where you get better at it the more you do it. We are completely certain that what is going to happen here is that by the time candidate campaigns and maybe some issue campaigns get to the maturity that they are ready to go out and knock on doors for some of the candidate campaigns for 2018, it might not be until the summer of 2018, but when they do, they are going to find these volunteers who have been doing Knock Every Door canvasses, they are going to be ready to come and be their top volunteers and start canvassing for that candidate for that campaign. We think that when the party catches up to the people and they open up their own canvasses for these important races to come that we are going to have a bunch of people that are ready to go, they have been doing this all along, and that can be huge contributors to climbing that hill that we have to climb, which is midterm elections. Sarah: This obviously comes out of your work on the Sanders campaign and the willingness to trust people to go run their own canvass, to do things largely without asking for permission. The tough question will be: How do you decide who is part of the movement and who isn’t? Becky: The folks behind Knock Every Door are working on a lot of things as part of the resistance. This is a certain platform that we thought could be important to all sorts of things that are going on. For example, a lot of the Swing Left chapters and Indivisible chapters are running Knock Every Door canvasses. They have a program, we have a platform to help people with resources to get trained and tools to use and data entry ability and the conference calls where people can debrief together and support each other. In this work we have really said this platform is going to be used by anyone who supports racial and economic justice. But in our other work we are more specifically ideological. There is a real divide in the party right now and all these calls for unity within the Democratic Party, I think they kind of get it wrong, the calls for unity and healing. I think what we actually have [is] groups of people that believe different things. I think we have factions or formations, and the people we generally refer to as the neoliberals, they want to have a few more winners and a few less losers, but they want to keep the current economic system basically the way it is. Then, there are other people that think that financialized capitalism is a huge contributor to gross economic and racial injustice and that we have to take on capitalism and structural racism at the same time. That is incompatible with a party which represents big money and elites in this country. In our other work, we are working on racial justice campaigns. We are working to elect district attorneys who are going to end mass incarceration. We are looking at other municipal and county campaigns where we can stop pipelines and protect voting rights, supervise elections and that kind of stuff. I think that it is important to be clear about what you believe in and to be working for specific solutions, but also I think it is sort of the tax on all of us, or maybe a tithe, that we all need to contribute to creating practices and infrastructure for everyone that is going to lift all boats. And I think that when we have a system or when we are pushing tactics that involve getting more people involved, getting volunteers involved, and talking to more voters that is good for strengthening little-d democracy. This is how we make people more important than money and it is something that we need to work on even as we are pursuing other specific policies. This is why we are really open to this being something we hope is adopted by the parties, no matter where we stand on some of the issues and some of the ideological battles which we are engaged in and that I think are really important, but I think this is important, too. Sarah: I suppose is part of the goal of this is to bring some feedback back to candidates and campaigners about what people actually care about and what people are actually feeling and that should shape what those policy decisions end up being, right? Becky: Yes, I think that is right. I think if campaigns actually heard word for word from voters, and if they tried to talk all the voters—not just a small number of voters they cherry-picked to swing an election—there are a lot of things to take away from the 2016 presidential election. One of the things to take away was how absolutely dangerous it was, that strategy which was going for 50 percent of the vote plus one because there should have been a wide margin between the Clinton campaign and the Trump campaign going into election day. Had there been that wide margin, then the Comey revelations and the other things, they could have gotten it down some, but it wouldn’t have been so catastrophic. The big data strategy is where essentially you hire a bunch of data consultants to run a bunch of models to find out, “What is the smallest number of people you can talk to and win? Who are those people and what do they care about?” We need to talk to everybody. When you talk to a small group of people, they may not reflect back what the campaign needs to hear and about what is really going on with most of the constituents in that race. I think that campaigns need to hear from the majority of the people how policies are affecting their lives. Then, that could really change what politicians decide to talk about and fight for. One of the things that I really learned from talking to people across the country is that the people that are not participating in elections, the so-called “low information voters,” it is not that they are ignorant people at all. In fact, time and time again, when I talk to them I come away feeling like they have a very sophisticated political analysis and they are choosing not to participate in politics. Not because they don’t know, but because their liberation is not on the ballot or they don’t see how voting is actually going to materially change anything in their lives. I think that reestablishing the feedback loop of talking voters is doing an important thing. That the concerns from the people that are not participating can also be something that politicians take into account, not just the narrow slice of voters who they think will put them over the top. Sarah: We are having this conversation shortly before the People’s Summit, which is going to be the second year in a row of this post-Bernie campaign gathering. You are going to be talking. What are you looking forward to about it? Becky: I am really excited about the People’s Summit in Chicago. I feel like it could really be a turning point for the resistance in 2017. I am talking about a couple of things there. One, there is going to be a panel about big organizing after Bernie. Big organizing is this idea of campaigning behind big ideas that are really going to change things and getting as many people involved as possible in making change. And then also, I am really excited to be there because this is an explicit gathering of the left activists who are fighting both fascism and neoliberalism and are involved in a project of political education so that we know not just which races we need to win and not just who we are supporting, but, “What is it that we are actually for and why?” and “How is what's going on right now and is that caused by the deeper issues that are going on in politics?” I am very excited to be part of a movement that cares about this kind of analysis and putting it into action and that cares about bringing movement values into electoral politics. I think we will look back on the People’s Summit in 2017 possibly as a real turning point for the Democratic Party and for the American left at a really dire moment when big change is needed and the country could go in two very different directions. Sarah: How can people keep up with you and sign up to knock every door? Becky: Go to KnockEveryDoor.org. If you sign up at KnockEveryDoor.org, you will get a text message from a volunteer inviting you to be on a conference call where you can talk to people about how you can get started going door-to-door in your community. It is not just about getting some information, it is not just a software site, it is really a community of volunteers that are supporting each other to do this work and we would love to have as many people come and join us as available.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You By Pavel Alpeyev and Mark Bergen SoftBank Group Corp. is taking over Google parent Alphabet Inc's robot dreams, buying Boston Dynamics to pursue a future when more machines intermingle with humans. As part of the transaction with Alphabet, SoftBank also agreed to buy Japanese bipedal robotics company Schaft. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Boston Dynamics, bought by Google in 2013 as part of a robotics acquisitions spree, made its name with a series of two- and four-legged machines that are able to stay upright even when pushed or traversing rocky terrain. Videos of the robots, known for their animal-like movements, are popular on YouTube. While SoftBank has already made investments in robotics, those efforts have yet to deliver hit products or pay off. That may change with this new deal. "Boston Dynamics is seen as the best in the world," said Tomotaka Takahashi, a University of Tokyo associate professor and the founder of Robo Garage Co. While there might be some concerns whether it might be difficult to work with the "geniuses" at Boston dynamics, he said, "it will be interesting to see what they come up with when they’re free to conduct research." It wasn't clear whether Boston Dynamics would remain within SoftBank, a Tokyo-based telecommunications and tech investment company, or become part of the Vision Fund, the $93 billion technology investment fund started by SoftBank founder, Masayoshi Son. The fund will allow the billionaire to cut even more ambitious deals than he's been able to do with his highly leveraged company. The Vision Fund already has the right to acquire 25 percent of SoftBank's holdings in ARM Holdings Plc, OneWeb, US-based online lender Social Finance Inc. and US chipmaker Nvidia Corp. This would be Son's second venture into robotics. In 2012, SoftBank acquired French company Aldebaran Robotics SA and two years later unveiled Pepper, a $1,600 humanoid promoted as the world's first robot endowed with emotions. Son envisioned building an ecosystem of apps that would let Pepper man storefronts as well as entertain people at home. But culture clashes between the Japan parent and French engineers as well as challenges of creating artificial intelligence capable of understanding natural language has left Pepper underwhelming and with lackluster adoption limited to Japan. "SoftBank may not have struggled as much if they bought a better robotics company" instead of Aldebaran, Takahashi said. The shares of SoftBank rose as much as 7.7 percent in early trading in Tokyo. The stock was buoyed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s 13 percent jump in US trading, which boosted the valued of SoftBank's stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant to $105.6 billion. "Typically, when Son makes a big acquisition, the markets are worried," said Tomoaki Kawasaki, an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities Co. "If this deal goes through the Vision Fund, no one will fret about the impact on SoftBank’s balance sheet." Alphabet decided to put the company up for sale earlier this year because it didn't anticipate a marketable product in the next few years, people familiar with the company's plans have said. Boston Dynamics was among the largest in a slew of robotics companies that Google bought in a short period. Before the acquisition, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company developed large, heavy robots mostly for potential military purposes, through research contracts with US government agencies. The acquisitions, orchestrated by former Android chief Andy Rubin, formed a hodge-podge unit inside the company, called Replicant internally. But the teams never cohered around a singular strategy, and Rubin left Google in 2014. Alphabet shifted all its robotics companies, aside from Boston Dynamics and Schaft, to its X research lab last year. "One of the challenges they've had is that the robotics don't scale as well for mass production," said Gene Munster, an analyst at Loup Ventures. "That's why they never fit with Google's model."

Google wants to make it easy for carriers to have interoperable RCS messaging Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/06/07 2:18pm PDTJun 7, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 174 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares261 Carriers Google News Last week Sprint and Rogers announced that users sending messages between the two carriers will be able to make use of RCS. RCS, of course, is the new standard to replace SMS that Google committed to back in 2015. So far each carrier seems to have its own idea for how RCS should work. But Google's recent work in cross-carrier communication is a big step towards ubiquity, and thanks to the tech behind this latest interconnect other carriers can more easily get in on the RCS action. We are deploying a "hub" model, so that carriers can interconnect to the hub once to get access to all other carriers connected to the hub. — Nick Fox (@RealNickFox) June 5, 2017 Google's Nick Fox followed up his announcement on the 1st with an answer to a question posed by our own Artem about how Google's RCS interconnect works. Instead of requiring that carriers individually connect their networks in some capacity to one another to exchange RCS messages, the RCS standards used by Google and the GSMA make use of a hub-style interconnect. Google's hub-based implementation of RCS in the recent cross-carrier announcement isn't a new technology, but it is cool. Back in 2013, the GSM Association published a white paper that detailed how RCS could work — and it's very much worth a read if you are even mildly interested in the future of carrier messaging, RCS, or even just networking. The white paper showed a few different methods for RCS implementation, such as using a direct NNI (Network-Network Interface) decentralized network for each carrier interconnection. Unfortunately, that particular solution results in a quickly rising number of interconnects as the number of carriers increases (n(n - 1) / 2), which means for each additional carrier in the network a larger investment needs to be made by those in it. The white paper also talked about a hub model for RCS, which has clear advantages for carriers. Rather than be burdened with developing their own connections to other carriers, each needs only connect to the one central hub presumably provided by Google. But, this centralized system will likely suffer from the same sort of weaknesses that all centralized systems do. For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. A central network is also more susceptible to censorship, attacks, or interference. However, it also provides some advantages, such as decreasing the investment of time and resources for carriers joining the standard. 4 node interconnect vs 36 The hub system proposed in the white paper (based on Openmind Networks implementation for SMS/MMS) does have drawbacks, but fewer connections might end up meaning faster deployment. And since Google has already done the work bringing the hub network up for Sprint and Rogers, each additional carrier should only responsible for its connection to that hub, as opposed to managing every link to every other RCS carrier themselves. Perhaps the recent news might help other carriers be persuaded to adopt Google's version of RCS, if for no other reason than cost-cutting. Why manage a ton of different networks for RCS when they can let Google cough up the cash for infrastructure? After all, if there's one thing carriers love, it's money.

Snowsky Mountain Does this mean I can use third-party apps like the SMS Backup & Restore app to backup and restore RCS messages? Jayson Stephenson Yes, but even better. RCS Messages are by default synced to your carriers cloud infrastructure. So if you were to change phones/tablets your messages will be in sync with whatever device you use. Snowsky Mountain Where would I go to turn off/on that syncing of messages? Would it be from a messaging app, like the Android Messages app? Or would it be through my carrier? Also, I wonder what (if any) effect that would have on T-Mobile's DIGITS service, which appears to do something similar for SMS/MMS messages... Jayson Stephenson I'm not 100% yet. But I believe your answer might be on what Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en MJ I have no interest in my carrier storing my messages. No thanks... I hope this can be turned off. Jayson Stephenson I'm sure a lot of people will agree with you. As I mentioned to Snowsky, I believe the option for that will be on whatever Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en Latheryin There goes your privacy. Dmitri Smirnov There was never any to begin with in the SMS world. Latheryin That completely is a matter of the country to live in. Dmitri Smirnov SS7 vulnerabilities prove, that lack of privacy transcends borders :) Also, there is nothing preventing your carrier to store the SMS "for technical reasons" regardless of a country. At any rate, while RCS might be a weird attempt to catch up with the messenger market, it is definitely not worse than the SMS. Latheryin Acutally there is. At least in the states. There are laws that prevent them from being more then a pass through. As for the messaging market. That also depends on the country you live in. Data messengers are bigger in developing countries then they are say in the states. A perfect example is that 3% of the US population even use a messaging app as their primary. SMS or just flat out calling is the preffered. David Ruddock Cool doc, but Verizon and AT&T are both signatories on the RCS Universal Profile. That doesn't compel them to do anything, but it seems unlikely they'd sign if they didn't intend to be compatible with the universal profile at some point, which is what Google Jibe is based on. Jayson Stephenson It doesn't say anywhere they they ever will implement it. In fact I expect they won't for a long time. All it mentions is their RCS is a proprietary format meaning it will work on only their internal networks. Also check out my comment on AT&T. newtonfb ATT showed a demo of it at MWC(I see that you made that comment on the doc, you should include the twitter picture also). I dont see why ATT and Tmobile will not have the UP out by the end of the year. Verizon is a different story as they have not showed or said anything about it. Jayson Stephenson The doc is open source. ;) Latheryin Yes attached showed it but it plans on placing it on top of their SMS setup not as a replacement. wicketr I think what he's saying is that "yes, it's proprietary now, but they planning on having UP with an unconfirmed launch date". The same is true for most of these. T-Mobile's is currently proprietary, but has been rumored to be UP completed by the end of the year. But it's undetermined if it's going to use Google's hub, or implement the RCS UP using Samsung's infratructure across the boards. Jayson Stephenson Yes, sorry for the confusion. I will see if I can design it any better. But so far the only carrier which we know guaranteed is in the process of installing the UP is T-Mobile. Which is mentioned in the doc. Tom Erlandsen Calling it now, I bet Allo gets RCS support fairly soon after this release Joshua Why? Android Messages - which has RCS - is made by Google. They could have implemented RCS into Allo this whole time. Tom Erlandsen Because Google wants Allo to succeed, and the absolute best way they can do that is by having some kind of carrier messaging fallback. They're not going to do SMS fallback, the Allo lead has come out and said that before. But they've never said they won't do RCS fallback. And the fact that Android Messages has RCS support means absolutely nothing. Google is infamous for its A/B tests, so it's hardly a stretch to imagine them having two apps with RCS support. If Allo with RCS fallback proves very popular and successful, I could imagine them discontinuing Android Messages and making Allo with RCS the default messaging app on Android, requiring OEMs to bundle it with their devices. But I only think they'll do that if Allo proves to be a success, as otherwise they'll face massive OEM backlash Joshua They wont discontinue Android Messages because here in Canada where RCS has been out for months, carriers have said in 2018 Android Messages is shipping with all of their devices. Tom Erlandsen Like I said, I don't think they'd discontinue Android Messages unless Allo was poised to take its place (i.e. had a decent userbase). And that would take a while to happen, even with RCS support. So yeah Android Messages will probably stay for a while, until Google has something it feels would make a better replacement, and I think that's what they'll try and build Allo into Jayson Stephenson You have a very similar theory as I do. I think the point of the renaming of Google Messages to "Android Messages" is to give all AOSP devices a baseline messenger app that is not branded with the Google name, and supports whatever standard your carrier utilizes. (SMS/MMS/RCS) Obviously Allo will not be getting full-SMS support at all for obvious reasons....(https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/53uvvu/why_sms_fallback_isnt_the_holy_grail_you_all/) But it might be possible for it to get RCS support and still allowing it to view, send, and receive SMS messages. As SMS messages are connected to your carriers data infrastructure instead of tied to your phone storage. (If you have an RCS compatible carrier) You can have Allo to communicate to any non-Allo contacts while still utilizing its rich features with Allo-Allo communication. Although I'm not sure if such an app/feature is even possible. If it were, we could see a messenger revolution! Abraham No this is how I see it. Android Messages is a very generic simple SMS/RCS platform. No real branding, no real benefit for Google. This makes carriers happy as they are not shoving Google on everyones faces by default. Allo, if it gets RCS support. Will be the Google branded, with Google assistant and many more things. But this will be for the user to decide if they want to use. Not set as default to keep the user and carriers happy. What do you guys think? Joshua More likely. Allo will never replace Android Messages. Android Messages is a very lightweight, clean, and basic app. Allo is full of many (some might call pointless) features most don't want or need. Allo is slow to open compared to Android Messages, which could get annoying if you just want to send a quick SMS/RCS message. McStagger are you keeping that spreadsheet updated? Jayson Stephenson Most certainly! .w oh, and google will be in the center of our communication even more! and if someone opts to use basic sms, which doesn't use internet and such one will end up being processed but damn google... how "noble" of them, and they will probably do this also for "free" (i.e. "only" our data will be collected)... 😆😄 Better Google than Amazon, Facebook, or Apple. That's for sure. .w I'm not so sure about that, given google cluster-freck attitude towards messaging apps... None of the above looks great tbh... Nana Adu-Krow Not sure what is so hard to understand about their messaging apps. Each one serves a different purpose. And if you feel like there's apps that lack certain functionality (like web app support or something) you have the option to use something 3rd party. .w ROTFL, I didn't say that it's hard to understand but the purpose of messaging app is, well... messaging. In case of google you have abundance of messaging apps and if they have distinctive functionality it's even worse - there should be single app that handles all the basics and does it well. That's not the case in google messaging ecosystem. Why would I put my feet in that mess? Just to find out that in a couple of months google would introduce yet another messaging app? or in case of operators - say that they were mistaken if not 100% chooses their solution. Bottomline - trusting google services, especially those not well established (like mail, calendar, docs or android ecosystem) is veeeery risky... Cakefish When will RCS come to the UK? NathanDrago My knowledge is that SMS have basically disappeared. I only receive SMS from my bank and my carrier. Everybody is using WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it. What's the purpose of this effort for RCS? Is RCS more capable than WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it? David Ruddock SMS is still widely used in the USA. NathanDrago But don't you suspect that by the time this standard even starts to spread, USA will already have caught up with the rest of the world (that is, abandoning non-data messages)? It seems to me a lot of wasted resources. raddacle Considering how comfortable people are with services like iMessage which discriminates against other OS's, I don't see SMS going anywhere for the US. SMS is as standard as possible for the US right now. The only way to change the standard is by forcing it, hence RCS. Santos Chavez iMessage says nope, sorry. iPhones are actually a lot more popular here in the USA than the rest of the world. Hence people never switch to other apps.Hence those iPhone users messaging an Android user and oops, it's an SMS now because, yeah, Android doesn't have iMessage. The Android user also wouldn't change apps either if their current SMS app allows them to chat with all of their iPhone using friends. Like me, for instance, I'm the only one in my group of 5 friends that uses an Android phone. Hence, my default SMS app, Android Messages,is all I need to talk with them. They don't switch apps because amongst themselves they use iMessage which is enough as they get advanced messaging features. See what I mean? RCS would at the very least make Android---> Android users have those same advanced messaging features they'd get with other apps. Pushing RCS as the standard works for us here because we've never switched out of using SMS apps. .w This highly depends on the country... Peter Obligatory XKCD https://m.xkcd.com/927/ Dat Nguyen Here in Belgium, SMS is still used (well less than before) because when it comes to mobile subscriptions, Belgium is one of the countries that has expensive prices. For example, for 15€ a month, the carrier I use gives you 2,5 hours of calling, unlimited texting and 1,5 Gb of data so it's not like I can enable the data 24/7 And none of the carriers in Belgium doesn't seem to be aware of RCS AbdulB1 keep it on 3g. You will survive within limits Ryne Hager RCS is supposed to be an open replacement for SMS/MMS. But it is really just another competing standard. At least when compared to things like WhatsApp it isn't a private system. Any carrier that wants to can jump on and start using RCS for messaging, while WhatsApp is not so open and requires that you use their app the way they want you to. So TL:DR RCS is just supposed to replace old standards. bekifft Obligatory XKCD: https://xkcd.com/927/ Latheryin Data only messaging services are not really used a lot in the states and many other places. Data rates are just too high where SMS is unlimited free. Kyle Salewski Really hoping that since Google is behind this, and with the recent revamp of Google Voice, that RCS would soon come to GV. Anyone have any insight on the complexity behind that? Or would it be really difficult since Google Voice isn't a traditional "carrier" but more of a middle man. David Ruddock It would make sense as a reason for them bringing it back from the brink of death, if nothing else. bekifft But Google Voice / Hangouts are the core of the Frankenstein monster that is Google Fi. They seem to be trying to kill both brands, so it makes more sense to do this as part of Google Fi. But maybe GV / GFi is just more A / B testing. Willie Chalmers III More like A/B/C/D/E testing for a messaging strategy. Santos Chavez I think Nick Fox also mentioned on Twitter that they're working on bringing RCS to Project Fi. Project Fi uses Google Voice as the back end for most of its functions so perhaps adding RCS to Voice is pretty much necessary for it to come to Fi-- maybe they'll "talk" to the same server, as such. Project Fi numbers are Google Voice numbers after all, technically. Snowsky Mountain Is an Internet connection required to send and receive RCS messages? Jay Yes. h4rr4r So then why bother with it over XMPP? Snowsky Mountain So what would happen if I had a cellular connection but no Internet (no Wi-Fi or data)? Would it fall back to SMS/MMS? Jay Yep, you got it! John Doe VoLTE? Phone service requires Internet now so why not messages? Evan Anderson For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. This is an extremely unlikely situation. Any large network system, such as this one, will have plenty of redundancy and excess capacity to avoid ever overloading the system. Star network topology is standard these days, so this architecture makes perfect sense. Any other topology is highly inefficient. Snowsky Mountain I wonder what would happen if that were to occur, though. Maybe it would fall back to SMS/MMS? Ryne Hager It's definitely unlikely, I'm more concerned about denial of service implications from a centralized system. Decentralized might be more expensive for the carriers, but it would be more robust. Houston Texas Robust how? Borgman Say Android Messages gets RCS on all carriers and stuff. What then will be the incentive to use Allo or other IM? Sruly J Well Allo has bots... Marcellus1 It'll be the particular feature set of each offering. I could use Allo because I like the bot and you could use WhatsApp because you like the stickers, for example, but it wouldn't matter that we aren't using the same app--which would be awesome and would drive competition better. Borgman But Allo won't get RCS, correct? Won't that remain an IM (unfortunately?). Or by some miracle (thanks to RCS) I'd be able to use Allo and message someone on imessage? Or are IM a whole nother story for a later date? (I just wish I could use X app and send messages, full resolution photos, HD video, read receipt, typing notify, to someone on Y app). Marcellus1 I don't know specifically what apps will get RCS and what ones won't. Hopefully all messaging apps will support it at some point. I suspect if there are any holdouts, iMessage would be the main one just because Apple likes to be intentionally incompatible. The goal of RCS, though, is to have exactly what you said is your wish. Borgman Man I sure hope that happens!!! Latheryin Will never take off as the standard. Not for a least 10 years. Joshua Canada already has had RCS for many months. We only have a few carriers, so it can easily be standard in Canada. Latheryin Everywhere has it. It is just a matter of who will be using it and what version they will use. It will end up like Android pay.. It to mention that is a but too much privacy that many people just will not freely Give up. Mainly not with the anti Google movement going on right now. Marty For some reason the headline of this article made me remember what I used to think about Google several years ago. I was of the opinion that the mentality at Google was of forging a future of making everything free...at least free in the phone and service market to start. Back then my impression of Google was that it was lead by activistic, hippy-culture young people who wanted everything in life to be free. I felt Google would try to lead society to forge such a mindset that "profit" was evil and that humanity being free from wants and needs was the future they wanted. Viktor Ivanov Good thing they aren't, I'd be really worried if they were. Marty Maybe they were to a certain extent but couldn't manage to bring their ideals to fruition. The people running the show right now seem to be money-driven. Syukri Lajin Google trying to make the carriers move to a more centralized system. Good thing they showed good example by not making another messaging app just for RCS. :D freshprince_87 I hope the other 3 US carriers (T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T) adopts Google's RCS messaging network so that RCS finally replaces SMS/MMS forever . SMS/MMS needs to freaking die already! When that happens, there won't be a need for iMessage and it's blue bubbles anymore 😒. Because every phone except for iPhones (unless Apples updates it's messages app in iOS 11)will have the Google's version of iMessage messaging service, RCS, in the United States. Borgman I don't know how many bozo iphone friends I have who say "the picture you just send is hazy" or "why does Android not send HD pics or videos". Drives me crazy! Just want a simple way to send those things to my friends! Warren Skipper No matter if the rest of the world uses RCS, Apple will never adopt it simply because it involves connecting to Google. Add on top of the fact that Google will likely have access to all messages that come through and you have a perfect recipe for Apple to publicly stand against it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson Not sure what you mean by "Connecting to Google", if Apple were to ever adopt RCS they would just have to utilize the exact same API's that every other OEM (Windows Phones, Android, etc...) uses. The only thing Google is doing is promoting the standard and trying to push adoption. Warren Skipper From everything I've read, there are some parts of the universal profile that seem to be Google-specific. In this article by Mobilesyrup, the carrier network Rogers stated “It’s a Google managed service”: http://mobilesyrup.com/2017/05/11/rcs-messaging-sms-canada-explainer/ I could be wrong though.Even if so, Apple wouldn't adopt it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson What he was mentioning in that paragraph that you quoted was the Google Jibe platform which those carriers have agreed to utilize to have Google host the server infrastructure for them. Look at the previous paragraph... "One point Sarhangi is quick to reiterate multiple times throughout our interview is that RCS “is not a Google service.”" RCS is NOT a Google exclusive service. Any Carrier, or OS, or Hardware manufacturer can utilize RCS 100% without any involvement of Google whatsoever. Warren Skipper You're mistaken what I'm saying. I know this is not Google exclusive. I also understand that any carrier can implement it along with OEMs like Samsung who can host the servers in lieu of Google. However, it's highly likely that Google has some form of code within the universal profile itself, that they can track, that is beyond whoever implements RCS. Again I could be wrong but either way, RCS has to go through someone's servers and who's ever it is will have the ability to mine everything that goes through it. Nicholas Conrad But apple hates industry standard, it interferes with their platform lock-in. mrjayviper Did that mean SMS communications will be data mined by Google as well? I believe they can't do that right now? h4rr4r Why not? They can read anything the device sends. If you own the kernel you own it all. mrjayviper Google can't read my SMS right now success they are not part of the process Ryan yes, they can. as he said they can technically read anything that exits your phone, if they choose to do so. This is how the current sms backup function works. Also if you use android messages they are already in the process mrjayviper i don't backup my SMS h4rr4r Google made the software that displays the text. If you use an Android phone. eddiepearson Honestly, don't care about this unless this means TMO will implement this tomorrow. All of this is null if TMO continues to not give a crap. You can get those free poop goodies every Tuesday though. bekifft The Venn diagram of people on Sprint with friends in Canada (and vice versa) are going to be very excited about this! JD So what Google is saying is RCS will be an unreliable POS that will be in Beta forever. Santos Chavez No that is not at all what they're saying. thecoolkid So now Google will be reading our texts too...? kamiller42 Control the hub? Control the world! Nice one, stop shop for intelligence agencies. Will hub participants be given access to all traffic on the hub? I'm sure Google will. "Better to mine you with my pretty!" MeCampbell30 I'm sure the carriers have no intention of letting google profit at their expense. kamiller42 The answer? Enticement. Offer the carriers the access to the products of the data mining. "We all benefit." Abhishek Saral RCS is just for SMS or are there any other benefits? senoredusty Separate ideas. Your question doesn't really make sense. Think of RCS ad the evolution of SMS Abhishek Saral Try to understand the context. It's just for sending messages or something else. senoredusty Yes. It's like fancy SMS. Read receipts, higher quality media, typing indicators, etc. Abhishek Saral People in US should start using WhatsApp already. Instead of making things tough for everyone. senoredusty Everyone in the US uses SMS already. If, over the course of time, people are naturally transitioned from SMS to RCS, that's a lot smaller a barrier than trying to convince each and every person to install yet another app. Sprint is going in the right direction with this, having Android Messages installed by default on all new Android devices. Also IMO WhatsApp is ugly. I don't want to use it, so I'm not about to try to convince everyone else they should. I'd much rather see Textra gain RCS functionality. Duder12 Fixed for you. *iPhone users in US should stop using iMessage already. Instead of making things tough for everyone.* Jay Who care? Americans have locked themselves into a vicious cycle, where 'SMS FALLBACK' in 2017 is necessary and their own self created injury infliction about being the 'green text' to 'blue text' users. Be it whatsapp or telegram or wechat, the rest of the world seems a lot more sane and the messaging discussion has not been one, in a lot of places on earth for years now. Instead here we are in 2017, with americans ranting about SMS and 'the imessage for android'. Something most nations will not care about Santos Chavez I think a lot of has to do with the fact that many folks here aren't really technically knowledged. Most never use any other app other than what came with their phone. Hence why SMS is still a thing, they just use that app to communicate with everyone. By gradually moving things over to RCS, those same consumers would still benefit from advanced messaging even if they never change their app. Sprint is helping with that since they're installing Android Messages by default on all new phones, and they already support RCS. ThePublisher So Google will be able to read all texts... awesome... Erstam Why don't they have Google voice setup with this already? James Where does it say Jibe will provide the hub connection to carriers for free? davidtb I could see how Google (a non-carrier) would want a piece of every RCS message (via their servers) who's at the center of the hub? RCS is pretty, but not a necessity, needa I wonder if Google is going to let everyone in the hub get the data. Yuri Vidal Can someone please explain me why use RCS (Or even SMS) would be better than simply using internet IP messaging systems? (WhatsApp, Telegram, Hangout, and so many others...) Paul Hansen A universal platform for all mobile devices. Not just the ones with a particular app installed. Santos Chavez Because then you could message someone the same way as those apps, but it wouldn't even matter what app they're using. For example, SMS apps will adopt the standard, as well (Textra devs have already said they will support it) so an Android Messages user on Sprint would be able to RCS with a Textra user on Rogers while having the same exact features of WhatsApp, Facebook, etc (like read receipts, typing indicators, large video sending, high quality pictures, and so on). Believe it or not, not everyone uses those other apps, especially here in the US. And even if they had an account in one or more of the apps, they may not be active on it anymore, like it is the case with my friends. With RCS you'd still be able to reach them anyway and have all of the advanced features those apps provide, across carriers and across apps. 2 Men-E I just want this to come to Project Fi Santos Chavez Me too! Really hoping that because Google owns the infrastructure and that they've streamlined the requirements to bridge to other carriers, it'll come to Fi pretty soon. Should be lots easier for them than all of the other carriers anywhere, after all :P Sonic Sunglasses I'm sure AT$T is busy working out its strategic plan to be dead last in implementing this technology. KChristainsen So basically we're still far off from RCS becoming a reality, unreal Jeff Saul Everything goes through the Google. It has been decreed. Humans will bow down to the Google. The Google reigns supreme. Soraya Xel For Google's next trick: Steal everyone's SMS data too. xyz No big deal. In most countries, the telecom regulators will set a standard that all carriers will have to follow. In the US, it'll be a mess. Đức Thành This is always the case: Google wants to help make something better for everyone, they have an idea that can help people improve things for themselves, which then more often than not gets rejected because everyone is a selfish and foolish asshole whose only interest is their own short-term benefits. Much of humanity is like that. Sometimes I think I can begin to get why in sci-fi movies the supreme AI ruler just wants to get rid of all humanity: Humanity's stupidity is a threat to their very existence.

Chrome Beta 60 adds new search widget, limits the Vibration API to combat malware ads, and more [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 8:10pm PDTJun 8, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 35 Share on Twitter Total Shares121 Applications Google News Article Contents 1 New search widget 2 No more vibrating ads 3 New context menu 4 New file picker 5 Other features 6 APK Download Chrome 59 was just released, which means Chrome 60 has graduated to beta status. This version includes a few interface changes, like a new context menu and file picker, as well as a new search widget. The Vibration API also has some new limitations to combat malware ads. Let's take a look. New search widget We previously covered Chrome's new search widget, which was developed as a result of an anti-trust lawsuit Russia. Russian search company Yandex claimed that Google violated local competition rules, and the settlement required Google to develop a search widget that could change between search engines. At some point, this will replace the normal Google search widget for Android phones sold in Russia. It uses whatever search engine you have set in Chrome, and starting with version 57, Chrome supports almost any search engine you could want to use. It doesn't appear to have changed since we covered it in Chrome Dev 60. No more vibrating ads You've probably seen those fake full-screen malware ads before - the ones that vibrate your phone. This is possible thanks to the Vibration API introduced a few years ago. I'm sure someone thought that web games would be pretty cool with if they could vibrate your phone, but I've only ever seen it used by malicious advertisements. Starting with Chrome 60, pages will no longer be able to vibrate your device unless you tap on the page first. I still think the Vibration API should be removed entirely, or at least have to ask the user permission first (like camera access), but this is a step in the right direction. In a similar move, the beforeunload JavasScript function will only work if you have tapped on the page. This is also commonly used by malicious advertisements, to show an alert as you try to close the window/tab. New context menu If you're not aware, the 'context menu' is the name of the menu that appears when you long-press a link or image in Chrome for Android. Chrome 60 includes a fancy new context menu, but for now, it's disabled by default. You can turn it on by switching the #enable-custom-context-menu flag to 'Enabled.' So what's so great about this new menu? Not only does it have helpful icons next to each menu item, it has a tabbed interface if you select an image contained in a link. Take a look at the below screenshots:     From left to right: link and linked image in Chrome 59, link and linked image in Chrome 60 There aren't any new menu items, everything just looks cleaner. I like it. New file picker The context menu isn't the only interface element to get a facelift in Chrome 60. There's also a new photo/file picker, which appears when you try to upload a file to a webpage. Just like the context menu, this is hidden behind the #enable-new-photo-picker flag, and must be turned on manually (for now).   Left: File picker on Chrome 59; Right: File picker on Chrome 60 You can tell this is a bit unfinished - I imagine recent photos are supposed to appear on the new popup. Still, it's already an improvement from Chrome 59's picker. Other features As with every Chrome release, Chrome 60 includes several smaller changes that may go unnoticed by most users and/or developers. Here are a few of them: Google previously added support for the paymentRequest API to Chrome, which allowed sites to checkout using Android Pay on Android (I still haven't seen a real site that does this). This will be extended to other payment apps starting with Chrome 60, but apps have to add support for the API. Several non-standard animation functions, like WEBKIT_KEYFRAMES_RULE and WebKitTransitionEvent, have been removed. The WebUSB API is now enabled by default. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Thanks, Google Chrome team. Peter You can enable the VibrationAPI changes in Chrome 59 via a flag which is handy. chrome://flags/#vibrate-requires-user-gesture Also same for the new file picker, although it seems quite broken. Launch the file picker, close it, then try to launch it again and it often doesn't work. YMMV. Sruly J I don't really deal with vibrating ads anymore (very rarely), but I'm more thrilled with this change than how Artem feels when he can go a week without experiencing #artemsluck. Jay It's amazing that those spammy malware sites have managed to avoid destruction for so long. I can't wait for the day.. Syukri Lajin I have never seen any website that uses the vibration API except for malwares. Until now, I thought they were using some kind of hack to get the phone vibrating. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I've only seen it used by ads. Oktawiusz Wieczorek I think sites like Facebook use the API for the notifications. So it is not entirely useless. Gotmilo greatly needed .. especially since androidpolice blocked adblockers for their websites and i'm still getting popup ads with vibrations.... Jay Even if you've got acceptable ads enabled? needa I don't, and I never do. With or without adblocker. This site is pretty clean. You must have something else going on. On a side note. I started using Fair Adblocker last night. It gives you the standard google adverts, which you can tell it how many you want to see, and gets rid of the rest. You can even selectively get rid of things if you want. I also don't get the popup asking me to give them two cents a view. Nate Is the app shortcut for "New incognito tab" missing for anyone else? It's been gone for a while for me. boop ;) I've always had it.

Carson Saldanha Why is there always two camera icons in the file picker menu? abqnm That search bar doesn't so much as search using the search engine in Chrome as it does just open a quick overlay of the Chrome omnibox on the screen.

Business Report | 9 June 2017, 06:54am Wesley Diphoko Recently South Africans have been exposed to a multitude of reports about #GuptaEmails. Some have used these reports to motivate the call for President Jacob Zuma to step down. Some have questioned the authenticity of these e-mails. The fact that some in society have questioned the veracity of these e-mails points to a challenge in society, which relates to the broken trust between society and the media industry. Tell a friend Wesley Diphoko, Online Editor,Business Report (02 June 2017) Everyday society is bombarded by fake news which creates a challenge for even most authentic news and content. This means that even news organisations that try to provide accurate information in the form of news will be confronted with an expressed lack of trust by its intended audience. It means that there’s a need for the media industry to regain the trust of society. The question is: How can the media regain societal trust? A number of organisations are thinking about the solution to this challenge, among such organisations there’s Google. The leading technology organisation Google has just announced its intention to work closely with the media industry. Intention Part of its intention is to assist the media industry to regain the trust of society through its technology. The challenge with this move by Google is that as long as the solution to the media trust challenge is led by entities with commercial interests it will be difficult to built a solution to this challenge. The fact that servers of multinationals such as Google are based in the US creates doubts in the minds of international governments. This will become another source of trust issues, especially with leaders such as President Donald Trump (father of fake news) at the helm of the US, where Google is based. Google understands that to assist in regaining the trust of society in the media industry, data will be at the centre of developing a solution. The only issue is that such a solution should not be led by an entity with commercial interests of such data. The media industry can use data to regain the trust of society by reporting based on facts that can be accessed by society. It should be possible for a reader of #GuptaEmails to view the raw version of the e-mails and also know how the e-mails were obtained. Going forward, the media industry in South Africa therefore needs to develop a neutral entity that will serve as the guardian of data, upon which the industry will base its reports. Society should be able to identify accurate information based on an identifying mark of content that indicates that content is sourced from a credible and neutral entity. This is not a task that should be left to organisations such as Google. It should be an industry-wide initiative in collaboration with the technology industry in its purest form. In my capacity as the head of Independent Media Lab I propose that the technology industry in South Africa should collaborate with the media industry to solve the current challenge of fake news and not leave this issue to organisations such as Google. Wesley Diphoko is the Online Editor for Business Report and head of Independent Media’s Digital Lab.

(Image courtesy Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya) When you can’t go to the museum, the museum comes to you. A new virtual exhibition playing out on Google reflects 3,000 years of world fashion, and includes displays from two Mumbai museums — the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Bhau Daji Lad. Their exhibits focus on specially crafted textiles passed on from one generation to the next, and variations of the sari, India’s iconic drape, exploring the types of saris, motifs and embellishments and the stories behind each. The exhibition also details the craftsmanship that goes into India’s unique textiles, and the history of cotton in the country. The exhibition is being hosted by Google Arts & Culture, in collaboration with 183 cultural institutions from 42 countries, including the US, UK, France and Japan. It’s called ‘We Wear Culture’. It opened on June 8. And it holds quite a few surprises for the virtual explorer. “You might be surprised to find that the sari, jeans or little black dress in your wardrobe has a centuries-old story,” says Amit Sood, director of Google Arts & Culture. Family heirlooms ‘Potrait of Mrs Dhurandhar with baby (June 1875)’, exhibits the country’s tradition of heirloom textiles. Wedding finery Note the different animals in each gold orb. Benarasi saris are integral to weddings of many Indian communities. This 19th century Banarasi sari is a symbol of how traditional textiles are passed on from generation to generation as a symbol of love and care. The nine-yard drape A picture postcard depicts a woman wearing a traditional brocade sari. Zabla and topi of Jamsetji Tata This outfit was made for a baby Jamsetji Tata, founder of the Tata empire, for his sixth-day ceremony. The ceremony was celebrated at Navsari on March 8, 1839. According to family records the outfit was made of silk. Culture through thread and needle This exhibit, named ‘Chanda talking to a Friend’, dates back to the Sultanate period, 1525 -1575 CE. Tradition on the verge of extinction Kunchi is an heirloom textile from Maharastra which is gifted to a Maharashtrian child during his naming ceremony. This kunchi was stitched by Indu Nene for her son in 1962. It was also worn by her grandson in 1993. It was gifted to the museum in 2013. The tradition is on the verge of extinction. more from mumbai Amit Shah to visit Mumbai next week, plot BJP’s Maharashtra strategy for next Assembly polls Jun 09, 2017 10:38 IST Mumbai gets 25 new hybrid buses Jun 09, 2017 10:37 IST New Horizons, New Courses Promotional Feature Recommended for you Read more Sattriya dance form to narrate the mythological love story of Usha and Aniruddh ITPA revives one of its classic plays, Ek Mamuli Aadmi, to celebrate its 75th year India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Pune Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper interactives Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini Studymate Englishmate HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Chrome Beta 60 adds new search widget, limits the Vibration API to combat malware ads, and more [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 8:10pm PDTJun 8, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 35 Share on Twitter Total Shares121 Applications Google News Article Contents 1 New search widget 2 No more vibrating ads 3 New context menu 4 New file picker 5 Other features 6 APK Download Chrome 59 was just released, which means Chrome 60 has graduated to beta status. This version includes a few interface changes, like a new context menu and file picker, as well as a new search widget. The Vibration API also has some new limitations to combat malware ads. Let's take a look. New search widget We previously covered Chrome's new search widget, which was developed as a result of an anti-trust lawsuit Russia. Russian search company Yandex claimed that Google violated local competition rules, and the settlement required Google to develop a search widget that could change between search engines. At some point, this will replace the normal Google search widget for Android phones sold in Russia. It uses whatever search engine you have set in Chrome, and starting with version 57, Chrome supports almost any search engine you could want to use. It doesn't appear to have changed since we covered it in Chrome Dev 60. No more vibrating ads You've probably seen those fake full-screen malware ads before - the ones that vibrate your phone. This is possible thanks to the Vibration API introduced a few years ago. I'm sure someone thought that web games would be pretty cool with if they could vibrate your phone, but I've only ever seen it used by malicious advertisements. Starting with Chrome 60, pages will no longer be able to vibrate your device unless you tap on the page first. I still think the Vibration API should be removed entirely, or at least have to ask the user permission first (like camera access), but this is a step in the right direction. In a similar move, the beforeunload JavasScript function will only work if you have tapped on the page. This is also commonly used by malicious advertisements, to show an alert as you try to close the window/tab. New context menu If you're not aware, the 'context menu' is the name of the menu that appears when you long-press a link or image in Chrome for Android. Chrome 60 includes a fancy new context menu, but for now, it's disabled by default. You can turn it on by switching the #enable-custom-context-menu flag to 'Enabled.' So what's so great about this new menu? Not only does it have helpful icons next to each menu item, it has a tabbed interface if you select an image contained in a link. Take a look at the below screenshots:     From left to right: link and linked image in Chrome 59, link and linked image in Chrome 60 There aren't any new menu items, everything just looks cleaner. I like it. New file picker The context menu isn't the only interface element to get a facelift in Chrome 60. There's also a new photo/file picker, which appears when you try to upload a file to a webpage. Just like the context menu, this is hidden behind the #enable-new-photo-picker flag, and must be turned on manually (for now).   Left: File picker on Chrome 59; Right: File picker on Chrome 60 You can tell this is a bit unfinished - I imagine recent photos are supposed to appear on the new popup. Still, it's already an improvement from Chrome 59's picker. Other features As with every Chrome release, Chrome 60 includes several smaller changes that may go unnoticed by most users and/or developers. Here are a few of them: Google previously added support for the paymentRequest API to Chrome, which allowed sites to checkout using Android Pay on Android (I still haven't seen a real site that does this). This will be extended to other payment apps starting with Chrome 60, but apps have to add support for the API. Several non-standard animation functions, like WEBKIT_KEYFRAMES_RULE and WebKitTransitionEvent, have been removed. The WebUSB API is now enabled by default. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Thanks, Google Chrome team. Peter You can enable the VibrationAPI changes in Chrome 59 via a flag which is handy. chrome://flags/#vibrate-requires-user-gesture Also same for the new file picker, although it seems quite broken. Launch the file picker, close it, then try to launch it again and it often doesn't work. YMMV. Sruly J I don't really deal with vibrating ads anymore (very rarely), but I'm more thrilled with this change than how Artem feels when he can go a week without experiencing #artemsluck. Jay It's amazing that those spammy malware sites have managed to avoid destruction for so long. I can't wait for the day.. Syukri Lajin I have never seen any website that uses the vibration API except for malwares. Until now, I thought they were using some kind of hack to get the phone vibrating. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I've only seen it used by ads. Oktawiusz Wieczorek I think sites like Facebook use the API for the notifications. So it is not entirely useless. Gotmilo greatly needed .. especially since androidpolice blocked adblockers for their websites and i'm still getting popup ads with vibrations.... Jay Even if you've got acceptable ads enabled? needa I don't, and I never do. With or without adblocker. This site is pretty clean. You must have something else going on. On a side note. I started using Fair Adblocker last night. It gives you the standard google adverts, which you can tell it how many you want to see, and gets rid of the rest. You can even selectively get rid of things if you want. I also don't get the popup asking me to give them two cents a view. Nate Is the app shortcut for "New incognito tab" missing for anyone else? It's been gone for a while for me. boop ;) I've always had it. Using Chrome Stable and Canary Damodara Kovie [dkovie] Nice spoiler tag 😉 PI "Vibration API" No more Porn sites with Free Vibrator :D ChikuChakk They will still exploit it LoveHater Unless u touch that site , vibrator lol LoveHater Ok , I got it.It was there API, but it's now more restrictive . Carson Saldanha Why is there always two camera icons in the file picker menu? abqnm That search bar doesn't so much as search using the search engine in Chrome as it does just open a quick overlay of the Chrome omnibox on the screen. And it's incredibly awesome. It makes it one tap to open chrome, focus on the omnibox and launch the keyboard. And it's quite fast. bass-ackwards Word to the wise, use Samsung browser, it blows chrome out the water. And I used to use nothing but chrome after experimenting with all the others. Samsung browser is by far the best PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The Vibration API This was idiotic to ever have been added. Teja I want to login to sites using my fingerprint on Chrome.

Android Pay is starting its rollout to the Canadian market with ATB Financial, BMO, Canadian Tire, CIBC, Desjardins, National Bank, PC Financial, Scotiabank, and Tangerine. It will be using the tokenization services offered by Visa, Mastercard, and Interac here to authenticate payments, with support for Interac cards expected to go live June 5. Android Pay debuted in the U.S. in September of 2015 and is seeing adoption at a pace of 1.5 million new registrations per month. Worldwide, it’s accepted in more than 2 million locations. Google expects that adoption in Canada could show an even steeper hockey stick curve on the adoption graph. “Users are looking to get more out of their mobile devices and that’s why we’re bringing these services to the Canadian market,” says Spencer Spinnell, the head of emerging platforms at Google Inc. “The U.S. is a fragmented eco-system, Canada, on the other hand, is much more sophisticated. You’ve enjoyed contactless payments for awhile.” Speaking to a room of journalists via video conference from his Silicon Valley office, Spinnell said Google has been interested in launching to the Canadian market from the start of Android Pay. But technology integration takes time, he says. There’s a long list of well-known Canadian retail brands that Google describes as launch partners, from Loblaws, to Sears, to Chapters Indigo. Those are promotional partners to help advertise Android Pay’s availability, as any merchant that can accept contactless payments will be able to accept Android Pay. No set up required. At Toronto’s The Candy Bar, store owner Paola Giavedoni has been using a Moneris POS that supports contactless payment since she opened shop. She looks forward to accepting Android Pay as well, saying it can be more convenient than using cash. “Our transaction is now more about me and you and what you are buying and what you want, and not about the financials, which is great,” she says. “If you want to buy something from my shop, I want to find something that makes you happy when you walk out the door. How you pay for it doesn’t matter.” Giavedoni notices more customers using their phones as a payment option in store. Apple Pay has been broadly supported by banks in Canada since May 2016 and some banks have offered mobile payments functionality on their own Android apps over the past couple of years. Paola Giavedoni, owner of The Candy Bar, says she sees more customers using their phones to pay. Moneris, the most popular POS provider for Canadian merchants, says that one in three of all its transactions processed are now contactless. It predicts that will grow to half of transactions by the end of 2017 because of Canadians’ adoption of mobile wallets. It also says that of 18-34 year-olds, one quarter say they prefer to pay with a mobile wallet. About 85 per cent of Moneris’ 350,000 merchants can accept Android Pay with the contactless payments terminals they already use, according to Moneris. Sanjay Gosalia, the head of financial services at Google Canada, says Google worked collaboratively with its bank partners and networks to launch in Canada. TD and RBC are notably absent from the launch, but expected to begin offering support in the next couple of quarters. Google says that more technical integration is required for those banks. Google doesn’t charge transactions fees for Android Pay. It doesn’t disclose the deals it makes with banks for the service either. But for merchants, they can expect the same sort of transaction fees for a credit card used via Android Pay tokenization as they would as if it were used directly. Android Pay requires a phone with NFC and running Android 4.4. To use it, users just have to set up their payment credentials on their device. After that, they should be able to turn on their phone near any contactless terminal and it will detect it and make a payment under $100 without need for unlocking. For transactions more than $100, users will need to unlock their device. Android Pay differs from Apple Pay, which requires users authenticate each transaction with a fingerprint. Google says that if users lose their phones, they can use Android Device Manager to lock their devices, to prevent them from being used to make purchases. Another minor difference from Apple Pay – Apple Pay generates the payment token on the device in the Secure Element. Android Pay generates that token with a cloud service. Implications for Google Home launch in Canada In our review of using Google Home without it being officially supported in Canada, we mentioned that shopping is one of the few things that Canadians can’t do with it right now. The problem is that Google will only accept U.S. credit cards as payment. With Android Pay launching in Canada, Google will now accept Canadian-based credit cards (and soon debit cards) as payment methods. In theory, that should mean that Google Home users will be able to select that as a payment option within the Google Home app. (This is how it works according to an American user). Currently, if you’re using Google Home in Canada, the payment methods option is hidden from the Google Home settings menu. But when the device is launched in Canada officially later this summer, as announced at Google I/O, it’s possible that launch will include a shopping capability. Google says it’s not commenting on what the Canadian launch of Google Home will look like yet, in terms of services supported. Thanks for your interest, Brian!

Chrome Beta 60 adds new search widget, limits the Vibration API to combat malware ads, and more [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 8:10pm PDTJun 8, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 35 Share on Twitter Total Shares121 Applications Google News Article Contents 1 New search widget 2 No more vibrating ads 3 New context menu 4 New file picker 5 Other features 6 APK Download Chrome 59 was just released, which means Chrome 60 has graduated to beta status. This version includes a few interface changes, like a new context menu and file picker, as well as a new search widget. The Vibration API also has some new limitations to combat malware ads. Let's take a look. New search widget We previously covered Chrome's new search widget, which was developed as a result of an anti-trust lawsuit Russia. Russian search company Yandex claimed that Google violated local competition rules, and the settlement required Google to develop a search widget that could change between search engines. At some point, this will replace the normal Google search widget for Android phones sold in Russia. It uses whatever search engine you have set in Chrome, and starting with version 57, Chrome supports almost any search engine you could want to use. It doesn't appear to have changed since we covered it in Chrome Dev 60. No more vibrating ads You've probably seen those fake full-screen malware ads before - the ones that vibrate your phone. This is possible thanks to the Vibration API introduced a few years ago. I'm sure someone thought that web games would be pretty cool with if they could vibrate your phone, but I've only ever seen it used by malicious advertisements. Starting with Chrome 60, pages will no longer be able to vibrate your device unless you tap on the page first. I still think the Vibration API should be removed entirely, or at least have to ask the user permission first (like camera access), but this is a step in the right direction. In a similar move, the beforeunload JavasScript function will only work if you have tapped on the page. This is also commonly used by malicious advertisements, to show an alert as you try to close the window/tab. New context menu If you're not aware, the 'context menu' is the name of the menu that appears when you long-press a link or image in Chrome for Android. Chrome 60 includes a fancy new context menu, but for now, it's disabled by default. You can turn it on by switching the #enable-custom-context-menu flag to 'Enabled.' So what's so great about this new menu? Not only does it have helpful icons next to each menu item, it has a tabbed interface if you select an image contained in a link. Take a look at the below screenshots:     From left to right: link and linked image in Chrome 59, link and linked image in Chrome 60 There aren't any new menu items, everything just looks cleaner. I like it. New file picker The context menu isn't the only interface element to get a facelift in Chrome 60. There's also a new photo/file picker, which appears when you try to upload a file to a webpage. Just like the context menu, this is hidden behind the #enable-new-photo-picker flag, and must be turned on manually (for now).   Left: File picker on Chrome 59; Right: File picker on Chrome 60 You can tell this is a bit unfinished - I imagine recent photos are supposed to appear on the new popup. Still, it's already an improvement from Chrome 59's picker. Other features As with every Chrome release, Chrome 60 includes several smaller changes that may go unnoticed by most users and/or developers. Here are a few of them: Google previously added support for the paymentRequest API to Chrome, which allowed sites to checkout using Android Pay on Android (I still haven't seen a real site that does this). This will be extended to other payment apps starting with Chrome 60, but apps have to add support for the API. Several non-standard animation functions, like WEBKIT_KEYFRAMES_RULE and WebKitTransitionEvent, have been removed. The WebUSB API is now enabled by default. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Thanks, Google Chrome team. Peter You can enable the VibrationAPI changes in Chrome 59 via a flag which is handy. chrome://flags/#vibrate-requires-user-gesture Also same for the new file picker, although it seems quite broken. Launch the file picker, close it, then try to launch it again and it often doesn't work. YMMV. Sruly J I don't really deal with vibrating ads anymore (very rarely), but I'm more thrilled with this change than how Artem feels when he can go a week without experiencing #artemsluck. Jay It's amazing that those spammy malware sites have managed to avoid destruction for so long. I can't wait for the day.. Syukri Lajin I have never seen any website that uses the vibration API except for malwares. Until now, I thought they were using some kind of hack to get the phone vibrating. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I've only seen it used by ads. Oktawiusz Wieczorek I think sites like Facebook use the API for the notifications. So it is not entirely useless. Gotmilo greatly needed .. especially since androidpolice blocked adblockers for their websites and i'm still getting popup ads with vibrations.... Jay Even if you've got acceptable ads enabled? needa I don't, and I never do. With or without adblocker. This site is pretty clean. You must have something else going on. On a side note. I started using Fair Adblocker last night. It gives you the standard google adverts, which you can tell it how many you want to see, and gets rid of the rest. You can even selectively get rid of things if you want. I also don't get the popup asking me to give them two cents a view. Nate Is the app shortcut for "New incognito tab" missing for anyone else? It's been gone for a while for me. boop ;) I've always had it. Using Chrome Stable and Canary Damodara Kovie [dkovie] Nice spoiler tag 😉 PI "Vibration API" No more Porn sites with Free Vibrator :D ChikuChakk They will still exploit it LoveHater Unless u touch that site , vibrator lol LoveHater Ok , I got it.It was there API, but it's now more restrictive . Carson Saldanha Why is there always two camera icons in the file picker menu? abqnm That search bar doesn't so much as search using the search engine in Chrome as it does just open a quick overlay of the Chrome omnibox on the screen. And it's incredibly awesome. It makes it one tap to open chrome, focus on the omnibox and launch the keyboard. And it's quite fast. bass-ackwards Word to the wise, use Samsung browser, it blows chrome out the water. And I used to use nothing but chrome after experimenting with all the others. Samsung browser is by far the best PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The Vibration API This was idiotic to ever have been added. Teja I want to login to sites using my fingerprint on Chrome.

Release notes for Play Services v11 have been posted with a new API for smooth SMS verification and several significant additions and deprecations Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 3:32pm PDTJun 8, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 21 Share on Twitter Total Shares61 Development News Now that Google is through with its biggest developer conference of the year, it's time to deliver a few updates and fulfill some of the promises made during the event. Some of that is happening through and update to Play services. Google posted the release notes for the update and it includes a lot of additions, both big and small, and a few deprecations. For the non-developers in the crowd, most of this stuff isn't going to matter all that much, but there is one new feature that might catch their interest. A new API will allow apps to perform SMS verifications without accessing the SMS history. It's probably not a big change for users, and developers will still have to implement some changes to their app and server code before it can be used, but it means there will be fewer apps with an excuse to poke around in your SMS messages. There are quite a few changes to the different APIs provided by Play services, and developers should definitely check out the full list here. Here are a few particularly interesting things worth highlighting: SmsRetriever API is the SMS verification API mentioned above. It allows apps to listen for incoming SMS messages intended for them without asking users for permission to read all of their messages. This means phone number verifications can be entirely seamless with no authorization dialogs or manual steps to copy a code from a text message. It works by giving a unique hash to apps so they can pass it back to the developer's server. That hash should then be sent via SMS to the user's phone and parsed by Play services. Once a message with the hash is identified, it will be passed directly to the primary app. The RemoteMediaPlayer class has been deprecated from the Cast API. If you're using the Cast SDK v2, there is a guide available for migrating to Cast SDK v3. As we were told during I/O, all developers are now free to build Instant Apps. Details can be found here. Significant additions to Nearby and SafetyNet APIs, as well as some handy new classes for working with the Fused Location Provider and Awareness capabilities. If you haven't already done it, go to the SDK Manager in Android Studio or the one included with the Android SDK and update the Google repository to get started with the latest APIs.

He's on a different team now, so we're probably not going to see him around. David Onter > "Significant additions to SafetyNet APIs" I don't trust this part right here Bewear SafetyNet is getting more evil. Trooper311 More like Skynet. Daniel Tbh, it's all those rooting apps we're hearing about that made them want to put in all theses APIs. Hackers make the problems, tinkers suffer. That's life I guess. Ryan Hoffmann Wrong link to the API release notes. It should be this one: https://developers.google.com/android/guides/releases but you guys have it linked to your post about Instant Apps instead. Makay Chapulets I run v11 already... On BETA Willie Chalmers III Yep; knew it: http://disq.us/p/1ipjdav Allo probably did use a version of this, after all. I saw a discussion in the FirebaseUI Android GitHub repo that this would be a part of a (then) unreleased version of Google Play Services, and it's good to finally see SMS Retriever API going public. blindexecutioner Fuck your adblock popup, dicks. Hayden7200 Why, because you think these guys should spend all their time writing articles for you to read and not receive a paycheck? It's free to you, so stop acting so entitled. tim242 That doesn't give sites the right to abuse. Stephen Sharp You would think someone who has an adblocker installed would know how to block one more popup.....just saying... Jsilvermist Whenever I get an anti-adblock popup, I either just block it or disable JavaScript for that site, if both of those things fail, bye bye site. Edit: Also, I run anti-anti-adblock scripts :P jcopernicus Messaging is like a rash at Google. Now they're spreading into Play Services.

Creative Commons Zero Pixabay The open source arena continues to rapidly converge with the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Not only are technology industry titans contributing meaningful tools to the community, but international players and billionaires are making contributions. Meanwhile, some of our smartest people are also laser-focused on keeping AI development open and safe. Interest from China in AI has been ramping up quickly, and Chinese social media and gaming titan Tencent Holdings has just announced that it is opening an AI research center in Seattle, to be headed up by former Microsoft scientist Yu Dong. Reuters cites Tencent, which owns the WeChat messaging app, as Asia's most valuable company with a market capitalization of almost $300 billion. The center’s leader, Yu Dong, was a speech recognition expert at Microsoft. According to MIT Technology Review: "This may be the year in which China starts looking like a major player in the field of AI. The country’s tech industry is shifting away from copying Western companies, and it has identified AI and machine learning as the next big areas of innovation." Meanwhile, Elon Musk has stepped in with the formation of OpenAI, an organization that is focusing on anticipating the challenges that AI will present in the coming years, and keeping AI technology development open. It is a nonprofit organization with the dual mission of ensuring that AI stays safe, and its benefits are as broadly and equitably distributed as possible. Microsoft recently partnered with OpenAI to work on open tools and “democratize AI,” according to the company. You can follow the OpenAI Twitter feed to see just how rapidly the organization’s tools are being integrated with everything from open robotics tools to anti-spam filters. Musk isn’t the only billionaire to be pointing to the promise of AI. In a recent series of tweets aimed at college graduates, Bill Gates said “it’s what I would do if starting out today.” Tech Giants Continue to Deliver Free, Open Tools At leading companies in the technology sector, AI is a huge priority, and many of these companies are open sourcing important tools. Both Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai have been vocal about their contributions of open source artificial intelligence and machine learning tools. In a Google Founders' Letter to stockholders, Pichai said, “[Artificial Intelligence] can help us in everything from accomplishing our daily tasks and travels to eventually tackling even bigger challenges like climate change and cancer diagnosis." “The biggest thing that we’re focused on with artificial intelligence is building computer services that have better perception than people,” said Zuckerberg, on a conference call. “I think it’s possible to get to that point in the next five to 10 years.” Just this month, Facebook discussed new, open technology that could revolutionize machine translation, resulting in translations that are far more accurate than what is available now. In addition, Facebook has open sourced its central machine learning system designed for artificial intelligence tasks at large scale. It's a proven platform in use at Facebook. And, at the company’s recent F8 developer conference, Facebook also open sourced a new framework for deep learning and AI called Caffe2. Google has open sourced a software framework called TensorFlow that it has spent years developing to support its AI software and other predictive and analytics programs. You can find out more about TensorFlow at its site, and it is the engine behind several Google tools you may already use, including Google Photos and the speech recognition found in the Google app. Meanwhile, Yahoo has released its key artificial intelligence software under an open source license. Its CaffeOnSpark tool is based on deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence particularly useful in helping machines recognize human speech, or the contents of a photo or video. And, IBM has announced that its proprietary machine learning program known as SystemML is freely available to share and modify through the Apache Software Foundation. The Raspberry Pi community is waking up to the promise of AI as well. Some Raspberry Pi owners are building their own AI-driven voice assistants, and Google has open sourced an AI-driven “Voice Kit” for Pi devices. Previously, I covered H2O.ai, formerly known as Oxdata, which has carved out a unique niche in the machine learning and artificial intelligence arena because its primary tools are free and open source.  You can get the main H2O platform and Sparkling Water, a package that works with Apache Spark, by simply downloading them. These tools operate under the Apache 2.0 license, one of the most flexible open source licenses available, and you can even run them on clusters powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and others for just a few hundred dollars. Never before has this kind of data sifting power been so affordable and easy to deploy. H2O.ai’s Vinod Iyengar oversees product strategy at the company. In an interview, he said: “In the last five years the cost of storage has come down dramatically, as has the cost of memory,” he said. “Additionally, anyone can leverage an advanced computing cluster on, say, Amazon Web services, for a few hundred dollars. All of this means that organizations or individuals can take a whole lot of data and produce powerful predictions and insights from the large data sets without facing huge costs.” To learn more about the convergence of open source with machine learning and artificial intelligence, watch a video featuring David Meyer, Chairman of the Board at OpenDaylight, a Collaborative Project at The Linux Foundation.

Although Google's search engine and email services are blocked since 2010 in mainland China, mobile phones running its android operating system dominate China's market. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) We may not know what delicious dessert the next version of Android will be named after, but the mystery of what its official version number will be has been solved. Android O, the next version of Google's mobile operating system, will be (drumroll, please) Android 8.0, according to information tucked into the third developer preview, released Thursday. It was really only a contest between a 7.2 designation and the 8.0 designation, says Android Police, which first reported the development. © Provided by CNET The next version of Android has been revealed to get the 8.0 version number. Google confirmed the new designation. Considering the magnitude of Android O, it seems a new version level was warranted. The forthcoming software for phones, tablets, watches and Android TV will sport a picture-in-picture feature meant to make multitasking more convenient; a copy/paste function designed to be easier to use; and password autofill in Chrome for Android that's meant to save users time and typing. But about the mystery O, what sweet treat does Google have on its plate for us to devour? Perhaps an Oreo?  Or an oatmeal cookie? Maybe orange sherbet? Who knows.

According to searches on Google, that’s a challenging word for many British Columbians to spell. Google Trends has released a map showing which words Canadians struggle with province by province. Data was collected based on the most commonly searched words followed by “how to spell.” Last week, a similar map was released for the U.S., where four states also struggled with the word. We've made a few corrections to the legend. This is the one to use pic.twitter.com/0Z8fUlzmHc— GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) May 30, 2017 But it’s Alberta that seems to struggle with the strangest spelling of the word coined by Disney Classic Mary Poppins: supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Albertans aren’t the only ones. Four states also needed a little help from Google.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 130 Plus 1 on G+ 337 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares551 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues. Darshan Jain I am facing the same bootloop issue and my phones warranty has expired and Huawei and Google refused to help Shailla Chand My phone will be fresh off the charger at 100% and shut down within 15 minutes. Talk about frustrating.. Gerbil My 6p has been losing power at alarming rate always with Android system and Android OS at the top. Then it began randomly shutting down an demanding to be charged after sending a notification my battery hit 0% when I was well above 40% and failed to detect my SIM card for about 3 hours. I down own a power bank so I'm really suffering here as my phone dies midday and I can't use it for the latter half of the day. chesterbr Now that you mention... I (a no-bootloop-but-frequent-shutdown-at-30% Nexus 6P user) had a couple failures on SIM card detection. Not sure how long they lasted, removing and reinserting seemed to have done the trick... keeps one wondering... :-/ rpeltz My Nexus 6p shuts down when the battery drops below 49 percent. This can happen in as little as an hour of idle time and the phone is just over 1 year old. Cassy Forrester I had the shut off issue. It was shutting off at 99% after a couple of weeks of only shutting off at 48% and below. Still ridiculous. Anyway, I bought it through Newegg so I had to deal with huawei.. biggest fucking pain in the ass. We waited 22 days for a shipping label. Called on a thursday and they said by Monday it would be emailed. Still didn't come. Called again and they said another few days. Didn't come. Called AGAIN and after 5 hours of being on the phone (that day alone.. 15 hours total), they sent the email with the label. I sent it in and like 4 business days later it was returned.. same phone I sent it.. doesn't shut off anymore.. BUT they told us it was a software issue and that they couldn't fix the phone so they would have to replace it. Clearly they didn't replace it but it doesn't shut off so that's good right? Well no. Now my phone is not charging if I use it while it's on the charger... Also, I get the warning when it boots that it can't be checked for corruption. Fuck these people. Fuck this phone. My warranty was up by the time they sent the label but they did say they are taking phone's after warranty because they are having so many issues with this phone.. (also why they took so long to help me) Well no wonder they're taking them! They are only half ass fixing them. So if a half ass fix is worth it to you, call them. They might help. This is the US in case that helps. iRulLezZ My 6p shutted down with full battery and restarted all the time ! Nothing happes ! Pghgeek My 6p has the issue. Powers off before battery is low. Won't tun back on until connect to a charger then shows 40 to 60% battery. Have to use another phone. Don Smith My 6p purchased 11/2015 has been the most fantastic phone i've ever had but hey. Now i noticed that i never get the battery saver time. Then i researched. my phone is shutting down at 56% batter. Of course there is no warning that this is coming. So it's only useful if i'm plugged in at home, the car or traveling with my anker battery pack, Thank you anker. My exeperience with trying the warranty once is that it's worse than worthless. Details for file a clain, time passes then a letter that your claim is denied. Seems rediculous. Better to know you don't have warranty than wast your money only to be frustrated. I'm ready to give up on android and an unreliable beta company. but add me to the list of sabotaged 6p lovers. Kelly Kay Mine shuts down at 25% without fail. Robert Hynes I still have the shutdown issue....anywhere from 60 to 20%. Unlikely I will get a pixel or other Google device unless there is a fix. Maybe we just need a more high profile device like a Samsung in order to get noticed. Jeffrey Huston I started experiencing this for the first time on my Nexus 6p shortly after installing Android 7.1.2. It can happen anywhere from 20% to even 60%, and happens multiple times daily. I've had the phone for probably a year and am generally always on the latest Android version. I don't think it started immediately; might have started a week after installing 7.1.2. I initially blamed an app or a Google play services update, but I've been factory resetting my phone three times now, each time reinstalling and updating fewer and fewer things to see if it would stop happening. It hasn't stopped yet. My next step was going to be factory resetting and doing zero app installs and updates (then it's basically just a phone, gross), but then I stumbled on this article. Now I'll probably skip that next factory reset and see if Google will send me a new phone. Hans Breda I contacted Google Support about this issue. They were very cooperative and are sending me a replacement! Hope this will solve the problem. chesterbr I did not have the bootloop, but phone would shutdown anywhere below 30%. After reading some experiences here I got my battery replaced at a local shop (Mobile Klinik in Toronto, CAD$ 60 plus tax, service done in 1-hour, no data loss or anything), and the problem is GONE: phone goes down to 1% at a steady pace. Normal usage gives me an entire day, just like it did when I purchased it. I'll be sad if a class action lawsuit earns something (not for the money, but for the principle), but it seems it will give my phone at least another year of life (heck, possibly more, this phone is a beast). But I'll hardly ever buy Google (or Huawei) again - this is not how you handle such issues. Michael Magdy My Nexus 6p stuck on google screen.. And the shutdown and repeat again.. Noone could solve this till now.. Even the two companies google and huwaei don't respond or tell where is the problem I went to a software programmer.. He could do nothing also It's now just a piece of metal I need help Kishor Padghan My Nexus 6p experienced early shut down 2 times so far despite having enough battery. It can be restarted only after battery is fully discharge and charging the phone. My phone has been unreliable now, it can ditch me any time. RJ Southam Mine started this weekend, I got a whopping 19 months out of my phone, however it still boots eventually just not sure for how much longer... Elizabeth Warner I basically keep a charger with me all the time and plug in in the car, at the office, at home... Very inconsistent, sometimes shuts down showing orange, but today was shutting down and showed as being at 28%. I've been uninstalling apps that I don't use, have a battery monitor so that I don't over charge... Dave Haines mine turns off randomly with about 30-40% left on the battery i dont think i have actually had it come up with power save in the last 2 months.... Colin Olsen Experiencing more and more early shutdowns on my Nexus 6p lately. Messenger seems to be the most notable cause, but sometimes it's totally random. Sometimes my device can read 40% battery remaining and completely drain in a matter of seconds. It's frustrating as I use my phone for work and keep in contact with my supervisor, salesmen, and district managers. If my phone keeps dying before 12pm, I'm getting rid of it soon. That's unacceptable. Christina Moore I'm experiencing the Bootloop problem right now.

Chrome Beta 60 adds new search widget, limits the Vibration API to combat malware ads, and more [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 8:10pm PDTJun 8, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 35 Share on Twitter Total Shares121 Applications Google News Article Contents 1 New search widget 2 No more vibrating ads 3 New context menu 4 New file picker 5 Other features 6 APK Download Chrome 59 was just released, which means Chrome 60 has graduated to beta status. This version includes a few interface changes, like a new context menu and file picker, as well as a new search widget. The Vibration API also has some new limitations to combat malware ads. Let's take a look. New search widget We previously covered Chrome's new search widget, which was developed as a result of an anti-trust lawsuit Russia. Russian search company Yandex claimed that Google violated local competition rules, and the settlement required Google to develop a search widget that could change between search engines. At some point, this will replace the normal Google search widget for Android phones sold in Russia. It uses whatever search engine you have set in Chrome, and starting with version 57, Chrome supports almost any search engine you could want to use. It doesn't appear to have changed since we covered it in Chrome Dev 60. No more vibrating ads You've probably seen those fake full-screen malware ads before - the ones that vibrate your phone. This is possible thanks to the Vibration API introduced a few years ago. I'm sure someone thought that web games would be pretty cool with if they could vibrate your phone, but I've only ever seen it used by malicious advertisements. Starting with Chrome 60, pages will no longer be able to vibrate your device unless you tap on the page first. I still think the Vibration API should be removed entirely, or at least have to ask the user permission first (like camera access), but this is a step in the right direction. In a similar move, the beforeunload JavasScript function will only work if you have tapped on the page. This is also commonly used by malicious advertisements, to show an alert as you try to close the window/tab. New context menu If you're not aware, the 'context menu' is the name of the menu that appears when you long-press a link or image in Chrome for Android. Chrome 60 includes a fancy new context menu, but for now, it's disabled by default. You can turn it on by switching the #enable-custom-context-menu flag to 'Enabled.' So what's so great about this new menu? Not only does it have helpful icons next to each menu item, it has a tabbed interface if you select an image contained in a link. Take a look at the below screenshots:     From left to right: link and linked image in Chrome 59, link and linked image in Chrome 60 There aren't any new menu items, everything just looks cleaner. I like it. New file picker The context menu isn't the only interface element to get a facelift in Chrome 60. There's also a new photo/file picker, which appears when you try to upload a file to a webpage. Just like the context menu, this is hidden behind the #enable-new-photo-picker flag, and must be turned on manually (for now).   Left: File picker on Chrome 59; Right: File picker on Chrome 60 You can tell this is a bit unfinished - I imagine recent photos are supposed to appear on the new popup. Still, it's already an improvement from Chrome 59's picker. Other features As with every Chrome release, Chrome 60 includes several smaller changes that may go unnoticed by most users and/or developers. Here are a few of them: Google previously added support for the paymentRequest API to Chrome, which allowed sites to checkout using Android Pay on Android (I still haven't seen a real site that does this). This will be extended to other payment apps starting with Chrome 60, but apps have to add support for the API. Several non-standard animation functions, like WEBKIT_KEYFRAMES_RULE and WebKitTransitionEvent, have been removed. The WebUSB API is now enabled by default. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Thanks, Google Chrome team. Peter You can enable the VibrationAPI changes in Chrome 59 via a flag which is handy. chrome://flags/#vibrate-requires-user-gesture Also same for the new file picker, although it seems quite broken. Launch the file picker, close it, then try to launch it again and it often doesn't work. YMMV. Sruly J I don't really deal with vibrating ads anymore (very rarely), but I'm more thrilled with this change than how Artem feels when he can go a week without experiencing #artemsluck. Jay It's amazing that those spammy malware sites have managed to avoid destruction for so long. I can't wait for the day.. Syukri Lajin I have never seen any website that uses the vibration API except for malwares. Until now, I thought they were using some kind of hack to get the phone vibrating. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I've only seen it used by ads. Oktawiusz Wieczorek I think sites like Facebook use the API for the notifications. So it is not entirely useless. Gotmilo greatly needed .. especially since androidpolice blocked adblockers for their websites and i'm still getting popup ads with vibrations.... Jay Even if you've got acceptable ads enabled? needa I don't, and I never do. With or without adblocker. This site is pretty clean. You must have something else going on. On a side note. I started using Fair Adblocker last night. It gives you the standard google adverts, which you can tell it how many you want to see, and gets rid of the rest. You can even selectively get rid of things if you want. I also don't get the popup asking me to give them two cents a view. Nate Is the app shortcut for "New incognito tab" missing for anyone else? It's been gone for a while for me. boop ;) I've always had it. Using Chrome Stable and Canary Damodara Kovie [dkovie] Nice spoiler tag 😉 PI "Vibration API" No more Porn sites with Free Vibrator :D ChikuChakk They will still exploit it LoveHater Unless u touch that site , vibrator lol LoveHater Ok , I got it.It was there API, but it's now more restrictive . Carson Saldanha Why is there always two camera icons in the file picker menu? abqnm That search bar doesn't so much as search using the search engine in Chrome as it does just open a quick overlay of the Chrome omnibox on the screen. And it's incredibly awesome. It makes it one tap to open chrome, focus on the omnibox and launch the keyboard. And it's quite fast. bass-ackwards Word to the wise, use Samsung browser, it blows chrome out the water. And I used to use nothing but chrome after experimenting with all the others. Samsung browser is by far the best PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The Vibration API This was idiotic to ever have been added. Teja I want to login to sites using my fingerprint on Chrome.

Other features As with every Chrome release, Chrome 60 includes several smaller changes that may go unnoticed by most users and/or developers. Here are a few of them: Google previously added support for the paymentRequest API to Chrome, which allowed sites to checkout using Android Pay on Android (I still haven't seen a real site that does this). This will be extended to other payment apps starting with Chrome 60, but apps have to add support for the API. Several non-standard animation functions, like WEBKIT_KEYFRAMES_RULE and WebKitTransitionEvent, have been removed. The WebUSB API is now enabled by default. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Thanks, Google Chrome team. Peter You can enable the VibrationAPI changes in Chrome 59 via a flag which is handy. chrome://flags/#vibrate-requires-user-gesture Also same for the new file picker, although it seems quite broken. Launch the file picker, close it, then try to launch it again and it often doesn't work. YMMV. Sruly J I don't really deal with vibrating ads anymore (very rarely), but I'm more thrilled with this change than how Artem feels when he can go a week without experiencing #artemsluck. Jay It's amazing that those spammy malware sites have managed to avoid destruction for so long. I can't wait for the day.. Syukri Lajin I have never seen any website that uses the vibration API except for malwares. Until now, I thought they were using some kind of hack to get the phone vibrating. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I've only seen it used by ads. Oktawiusz Wieczorek I think sites like Facebook use the API for the notifications. So it is not entirely useless. Gotmilo greatly needed .. especially since androidpolice blocked adblockers for their websites and i'm still getting popup ads with vibrations.... Jay Even if you've got acceptable ads enabled? needa I don't, and I never do. With or without adblocker. This site is pretty clean. You must have something else going on. On a side note. I started using Fair Adblocker last night. It gives you the standard google adverts, which you can tell it how many you want to see, and gets rid of the rest. You can even selectively get rid of things if you want. I also don't get the popup asking me to give them two cents a view. Nate Is the app shortcut for "New incognito tab" missing for anyone else? It's been gone for a while for me. boop ;) I've always had it.

Carson Saldanha Why is there always two camera icons in the file picker menu? abqnm That search bar doesn't so much as search using the search engine in Chrome as it does just open a quick overlay of the Chrome omnibox on the screen. And it's incredibly awesome. It makes it one tap to open chrome, focus on the omnibox and launch the keyboard.

The second-generation Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPU) are purpose-built hardware that enables massive computations needed for machine learning at scale. Tensorflow, an open-source project for machine learning that Google created, will be the big winner with the new TPUs. The second-generation TPUs offer 180 teraflops of performance. Google is always interested in scale-out architectures and the TPUs are no exception. As part of the Google Compute Engine (GCE), Google is deploying TPU pods that are comprised of 64 second-generation TPUs. The total capacity of a TPU pod is a staggering 11.5 petaflops of computing power. "Using these TPU pods, we've already seen dramatic improvements in training times," Google engineers Jeff Dean and Urs Holzle wrote in a blog post. "One of our new large-scale translation models used to take a full day to train on 32 of the best commercially-available GPUs — now it trains to the same accuracy in an afternoon using just one eighth of a TPU pod." New TensorFlow Research Cloud Announced As Well Going a step further Google also announced the new TensorFlow Research Cloud, which provides a cluster that includes a thousand cloud TPUs. The TensorFlow Research Cloud is being made freely available to researchers. "We hope the TensorFlow Research Cloud will allow as many researchers as possible to explore the frontier of machine learning research and extend it with new discoveries," Zak Stone, Product Manager for TensorFlow, wrote in a blog post.

Sign Up Online Newspaper SectionsSubscribe Nation & World Verizon positions itself to take on Google, Facebook Company hopes to leverage power of Yahoo, AOL to grab more ad dollars By AP Technology Writer By TALI ARBEL (AP)10:54 pm NEW YORK (AP) – About 2,100 jobs are on the chopping block as Verizon prepares to combine Yahoo and AOL for a digital advertising offensive. Yahoo’s shareholders on Thursday approved the $4.5 billion sale of its key businesses to Verizon. The deal is expected to close by Tuesday. AOL and Yahoo will cut 15 percent of the 14,000 workers they now employ, or about 2,100 jobs, said a person familiar with the matter who requested not to be identified discussing the cuts. Using Yahoo Verizon has a simple goal in buying Yahoo’s core business: It wants to challenge Google and Facebook in the huge and lucrative field of digital advertising. But Verizon faces its own challenge in doing so, given that it will be competing against a slew of other companies also looking to break in. Verizon wants to become a strong third choice for advertisers by adding Yahoo’s popular sites and billion users worldwide to its own media business, which includes AOL and Verizon’s home-grown go90 video service. It can place ads on those sites, and can also combine data from visitors to those sites with AOL’s ad technologies and sales teams, and possibly also personal data from Verizon mobile customers, such as location and other information, in order to better target ads at individuals. Verizon has programs that use mobile-customer data for targeted ads and could combine that with data gathered by AOL and Yahoo. Verizon says customers can choose whether to participate. Yahoo and AOL are “positioned to do better together than apart,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. But he is setting the bar low. While Verizon talks of growth from the deal, Wieser said “not declining would be a success.” The vision Verizon sees online ads – particularly targeted ads – as a potential new source of growth as the wireless industry fights for U.S. users with lower prices and other discounts. Verizon has “essentially turned into a no-growth business,” said CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino. The ad business would be a “big deal” for Verizon if it goes well, he said. Tim Armstrong, the former Google executive who joined AOL as CEO in 2009, has for years wanted to combine AOL with the long-declining Yahoo. Although AOL has big-name properties such as HuffPost and Engadget, it hasn’t been as big of an online destination as Yahoo’s mail, finance, sports and other properties. The combined business, to be called Oath, will expand its news, sports, entertainment, finance and lifestyle coverage. Like everyone else, Oath will focus on video and mobile, where consumers increasingly spend their time online. Armstrong says he wants Oath properties to be a place consumers “visit every day” and predicts users growing to 2 billion from 1.3 billion by 2020, with annual revenue of $10 billion to $20 billion from roughly $7 billion today. Lowell McAdam, CEO of New York-based Verizon, teased last month that this could set the stage for a new streaming video service, competing with the slew of internet-TV services already out there. Verizon already has a free mobile video service, go90, that isn’t well known. ALTERNATIVES TO THE DUOPOLY Facebook and Google together draw about half the world’s spending on digital ads, and in the U.S., they’re even more dominant. They’re also where the majority of mobile-ad dollars go, eMarketer data show. The sway Facebook and Google hold for advertisers isn’t expected to change in the next few years. They had a head start on mobile. Yahoo has poured billions into acquisitions that have helped Yahoo make some leeway in mobile – but not enough. It’s gotten better at doing mobile ads, but it has had no major hit apps. Still, AOL and Yahoo together provide a much-smaller No. 3 in the U.S. for advertisers looking to reach lots of people. But even if Verizon’s goal is to just be happy at No. 3, there are several much smaller players that also draw advertisers. Snapchat is a niche hit with young people. Amazon has an under-the-radar ad business that supports its e-commerce dominance. Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, is expected to grow its piece of the ad pie; Microsoft will be just behind the combined AOL-Yahoo in the U.S. once the deal closes. Twitter, although it’s sorting out its ad business, is a significant smaller player. Globally, several Chinese companies also rake in ad dollars. And the combined company will also have to compete for people’s attention, and not just with other services that rely on ad dollars to survive. Popular sites like Amazon or Netflix also suck up time spent online, said eMarketer analyst Martin Utreras. “They’ve acquired these two dinosaurs and you kind of wonder, can they be successful?” Zino said. That will depend on Verizon being able to convince marketers that they know more about consumers than anyone else, he said. ___ AP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke contributed to this story.

Justin Sullivan Copyright Getty Images Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) -- Kids are creative when it comes to being cruel online. On Instagram, they'll post a group photo from a party and tag someone who wasn't invited to make them feel bad. They use music sharing apps to cyberbully each other in the comments of a song. Kids are even on Twitter "subtweeting" each other, making comments about people without directly using their names, just like the grownups do. Google wants to teach children how to protect themselves online and, hopefully, be a little less terrible to each other. The company is teaming up with educators and internet safety groups for Be Internet Awesome, a new campaign aimed at making middle and elementary school students into responsible digital citizens. The centerpiece of Google's program is an engaging game called Interland. It covers how to spot phishing and other scams, good password habits, not sharing personal information, kindness and conflict resolution. The game is available online for anyone to play. "A lot of it is just ignorance," said Jennie Magiera, chief innovation officer for a school district outside of Chicago. "We can get to them early, [and] teach them what trolling is." Part of Magiera's job is making sure students and teachers "know how to use technology for good and not evil." An expert in digital citizenship tools, Magiera was an early tester for Be Internet Awesome. After getting sucked into the game herself, she was also an unexpected success story. "I have a master's degree and I just learned more about password safety from this game from fourth graders [than I knew before]," said Magiera. Using the Be Internet Awesome classroom curriculum, teachers guide students through Internet basics. Later the kids hone their skills by playing Interland. To cross "reality river," they have to correctly answer questions about accepting friend requests from strangers, spotting fake news, and recognizing email scams. In another level, they are on a quest to spread good vibes, nix the bad, and report bullies. Many adults could benefit from the lessons in the game as well. A lack of online literacy might be one reason many parents don't think to have "the talk" with their kids about online behavior. Magiera finds many parents aren't even aware that kids under 13 aren't allowed on most social media sites. Parents may also mistake their child's technical proficiency with actually understanding the intricacies of online interactions. "Educators and parents are the first line of defense to create responsible digital citizens," said Stacey Finkle of the International Society for Technology in Education. The organization worked with Google to make sure the game met its standards. More awareness and empathy can reach kids who are mean online because they don't know any better or are following a stronger personality, said Magiera. But a class can't prevent everyone from growing up to hurl insults on Twitter or in internet comments sections. "There are some kids who are dealing with deeper issues or challenges that cause them to bully," said Magiera. "A cyberbullying curriculum isn't going to be a high enough tier of intervention."

Chrome Beta 60 adds new search widget, limits the Vibration API to combat malware ads, and more [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 8:10pm PDTJun 8, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 35 Share on Twitter Total Shares121 Applications Google News Article Contents 1 New search widget 2 No more vibrating ads 3 New context menu 4 New file picker 5 Other features 6 APK Download Chrome 59 was just released, which means Chrome 60 has graduated to beta status. This version includes a few interface changes, like a new context menu and file picker, as well as a new search widget. The Vibration API also has some new limitations to combat malware ads. Let's take a look. New search widget We previously covered Chrome's new search widget, which was developed as a result of an anti-trust lawsuit Russia. Russian search company Yandex claimed that Google violated local competition rules, and the settlement required Google to develop a search widget that could change between search engines. At some point, this will replace the normal Google search widget for Android phones sold in Russia. It uses whatever search engine you have set in Chrome, and starting with version 57, Chrome supports almost any search engine you could want to use. It doesn't appear to have changed since we covered it in Chrome Dev 60. No more vibrating ads You've probably seen those fake full-screen malware ads before - the ones that vibrate your phone. This is possible thanks to the Vibration API introduced a few years ago. I'm sure someone thought that web games would be pretty cool with if they could vibrate your phone, but I've only ever seen it used by malicious advertisements. Starting with Chrome 60, pages will no longer be able to vibrate your device unless you tap on the page first. I still think the Vibration API should be removed entirely, or at least have to ask the user permission first (like camera access), but this is a step in the right direction. In a similar move, the beforeunload JavasScript function will only work if you have tapped on the page. This is also commonly used by malicious advertisements, to show an alert as you try to close the window/tab. New context menu If you're not aware, the 'context menu' is the name of the menu that appears when you long-press a link or image in Chrome for Android. Chrome 60 includes a fancy new context menu, but for now, it's disabled by default. You can turn it on by switching the #enable-custom-context-menu flag to 'Enabled.' So what's so great about this new menu? Not only does it have helpful icons next to each menu item, it has a tabbed interface if you select an image contained in a link. Take a look at the below screenshots:     From left to right: link and linked image in Chrome 59, link and linked image in Chrome 60 There aren't any new menu items, everything just looks cleaner. I like it. New file picker The context menu isn't the only interface element to get a facelift in Chrome 60. There's also a new photo/file picker, which appears when you try to upload a file to a webpage. Just like the context menu, this is hidden behind the #enable-new-photo-picker flag, and must be turned on manually (for now).   Left: File picker on Chrome 59; Right: File picker on Chrome 60 You can tell this is a bit unfinished - I imagine recent photos are supposed to appear on the new popup. Still, it's already an improvement from Chrome 59's picker. Other features As with every Chrome release, Chrome 60 includes several smaller changes that may go unnoticed by most users and/or developers. Here are a few of them: Google previously added support for the paymentRequest API to Chrome, which allowed sites to checkout using Android Pay on Android (I still haven't seen a real site that does this). This will be extended to other payment apps starting with Chrome 60, but apps have to add support for the API. Several non-standard animation functions, like WEBKIT_KEYFRAMES_RULE and WebKitTransitionEvent, have been removed. The WebUSB API is now enabled by default. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Sruly J I don't really deal with vibrating ads anymore (very rarely), but I'm more thrilled with this change than how Artem feels when he can go a week without experiencing #artemsluck. Jay It's amazing that those spammy malware sites have managed to avoid destruction for so long. I can't wait for the day.. Syukri Lajin I have never seen any website that uses the vibration API except for malwares. Until now, I thought they were using some kind of hack to get the phone vibrating. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I've only seen it used by ads. Oktawiusz Wieczorek I think sites like Facebook use the API for the notifications. So it is not entirely useless. Gotmilo greatly needed .. especially since androidpolice blocked adblockers for their websites and i'm still getting popup ads with vibrations.... Jay Even if you've got acceptable ads enabled? needa I don't, and I never do. With or without adblocker. This site is pretty clean. You must have something else going on. On a side note. I started using Fair Adblocker last night. It gives you the standard google adverts, which you can tell it how many you want to see, and gets rid of the rest. You can even selectively get rid of things if you want. I also don't get the popup asking me to give them two cents a view. Nate Is the app shortcut for "New incognito tab" missing for anyone else?

(Reuters/Tyrone Siu) Share Written by Mike Murphy Obsession Machines with Brains 4 hours ago Google’s parent Alphabet has agreed to sell two of its robotics subsidiaries, Boston Dynamics and Schaft, to Japanese telecom company SoftBank. Alphabet had reportedly been looking for a buyer for the MIT spinoff Boston Dynamics for at least a year, as its robots were not making any money (and potentially because of the public’s perception they were “terrifying“). Alphabet reportedly had talks with Toyota over a sale, but one never materialized. In an effort to build to useful robots, in 2013, it purchased Boston Dynamics, which was led by Andy Rubin, then-head of Google’s Android operating system. Rubin left Google in 2014 to run a tech incubator—and recently released a new smartphone—and Boston Dynamics has floated somewhat adrift within Alphabet’s corporate structure since then. Every time Boston Dynamics released a video of its newest robot creation—whether it was Spot, the giant dog-shaped robot its engineers liked to kick; the newest version of its Atlas robot they liked to bully; or its latest creation, Handle, which appears more agile on wheels than Tony Hawk—the internet would light up with articles suggesting the future laid out in science fiction was finally here. But in reality, its robots were proofs of concept around challenges facing those trying to build general-purpose robots, rather than products ready for market. The US army said in 2015 that it would not be pursuing a contract to use one of its robots as it was too loud and difficult to repair in the field, and it’s unclear if the company had been able to commercialize any of its research projects to date. Softbank, on the other hand, has made a push in recent years into robots people are actually buying. The company purchased a controlling share in the French robotics firm Aldebaran in 2015, which produces the Pepper robot that was originally designed for SoftBank to use as a greeter in its retail stores. Pepper, which is shaped roughly like a diminutive person with a tablet strapped across its chest, sold out almost instantly when the $1,600 robot went on sale to Japanese consumers in July 2015. The company created a new division, SoftBank Robotics, around Pepper, and has been focusing on bringing the robot to new countries, including the US, and selling it to companies interested in using it as a greeter or marketing tool. Your future customer service representative. (Reuters/Tyrone Siu) Although Pepper might look like something out of the future, there’s not much that it can do right now that an Amazon Echo can’t. Its arms are essentially vestigial. While they’re pretty good at giving passersby high fives, they can’t really carry things, and the tablet on its chest does most of the heavy lifting when it comes to interacting with people. The robots of Boston Dynamics and Schaft, however, are attempting to solve real problems, beyond waving at people. Boston Dynamics’s Atlas robot can carry heavy loads even in challenging environments, and the Handle can, erm, handle heavy items. In a recent talk, the company’s founder, Marc Raibert, hinted that these human-sized bots could help out in restaurants or in emergency-response situations. SoftBank also last year purchased the chip manufacturer ARM, which makes processors for Apple and other companies, for nearly $32 billion. It was the company’s largest acquisition to date, far larger than the $21 billion and $17 billion it paid respectively for Sprint Nextel and part of Vodafone, two telecoms companies that are much more closely linked to its core business.

Scott Applewhite) It’s unclear what SoftBank paid for Alphabet’s two robotics companies, but perhaps it sees a future where robots are as commonplace in our lives as smartphones are today. And what better way to start realizing that than by bringing together leading computer processors and robotics hardware? In a statement, SoftBank’s chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son talked about how robots can augment the limitations of human capabilities. With its new acquisitions, the company plans to “explore applications that can help make life easier, safer and more fulfilling.” Whether SoftBank has what it needs to actually realize this vision where Alphabet could not, remains to be seen.

Google app v7.4 beta prepares for Google Home calling, manual rerouting of voice commands, and more [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/06/07 1:49pm PDTJun 7, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 32 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Videos Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Calling through Google Home 1.2 Manual control over which Assistant answers 1.3 Independence Day [US-Only] 1.4 Notification access for easier access to contacts and messages 2 Download There's another version of the Google app floating around in the wild, and as we've probably become accustomed, it doesn't appear to make any notable changes upon installation. However, there are some interesting elements floating around in the apk. In this update, we can see the first signs of support for making calls with Google Home and a new action that allows users to manually reroute voice commands to the device in their hand. There's also a new feature that looks at your notifications in an effort to give easier access and suggests about your contacts and messages. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Calling through Google Home Google announced this one at I/O, so it's far from a surprise that things are starting to show up in the Google app. Think of this section as a status update. In case you missed it, the announcement at I/O declared that it will soon be possible to use Google Home a bit like a speakerphone. More specifically, you'll be able to start and carry through a call on Google Home. There were still a lot of unanswered questions, but a few of those might be cleared up with this teardown. To begin with, some people have predicted that the call still occurs through the caller's phone, but the audio is traveling over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, while others have suggested a phone number will be linked to Google Home and calls will be made through the Google Voice infrastructure. It appears that the latter of the two is the winner. Some of the new strings show that users will link their phone service to Google Home for outgoing calls. Another common question is whether or not people will be able to answer incoming calls through Google Home. At the moment, only outgoing calls are mentioned in the strings, which hints that incoming calls might not be supported. On the other hand, this implementation doesn't look finished, and support could be added in the future, so this is far from conclusive. code <string name="assistant_settings_active_phone_service_category_title">Linked phone services</string> <string name="assistant_phone_preference">assistantPhone</string> <string name="assistant_settings_more_phone_servicer_category_title">Other phone services</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_title">Phone</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_default_snackbar_text">%1$s is your default phone service.</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_link_dialog_text">Link your Google Account to %1$s to make calls on Google Home through Google Assistant.</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_no_preference_title">Anonymous</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_no_preference_summary">You will appear as unlisted to others</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_service_category_title">The Assistant will use the phone service provided below for outgoing calls on Google Home. E911 is not available.</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_unable_unlink_default">Cannot unlink your default phone service.</string> Manual control over which Assistant answers Staying with the topic of Google Home, but going wider to all devices that run Assistant, it looks like Google is still working working out the best way to handle multiple always-listening devices. A new line of text has been added that will be used to give direction to the Assistant that the device in your hand is the one that should be responding. <string name="opa_mult_devices_answer_on_phone">Answer Here</string> There are no clear signs about how this line will be used, but it looks like it will be a button on the toast message. That is to say you'll probably have a brief span of a second or two after a command is claimed by another device when you'll be able to insist it should be handled on your phone. Obviously, we all want voice commands to be handled by the perfect device each time, but since that would take some bewilderingly perfect artificial intelligence and perfect knowledge of context, that's pretty unrealistic. Most of us expect commands to at least route to the device that can handle them, not to be sucked into the black hole that is a Google Home when certain commands only work on a phone. I welcome the option to manually tell Assistant to answer on my phone. It may be a hacky workaround, but at least it gives us an out that doesn't require whispering into a phone mic or walking over to the Home unit to hit a mute button. Independence Day [US-Only] There's actually nothing special to say here – Google just added a new line for activities scheduled for July 4th, which is Independence Day in the United States. <string name="july_4th_activities">July 4th activities</string> I don't have much to read into about a line like this, but I am going to predict those of us in the US will see this in a little less than a month. :p Notification access for easier access to contacts and messages If you were paying much attention to Google I/O, you may have caught that Android O is bringing a quirky new feature called Notification Dots. In short, the Google Launcher will draw a little dot over the corner of app icons when they have pending notifications. It seems Google may have another feature planned that will also begin watching your notifications. Several new lines describe a feature that will "help you find your contacts and messages," but it needs to watch your notifications to do that. code <string name="notification_accessable_apps_category_title">Notification access</string> <string name="notification_access_desc">Google uses notifications you've received on this device to help you find your contacts and messages. This is done solely on this device and these results are only shown to you.</string> <string name="notification_enabled_apps_title">Select the apps you'd like to include:</string> <string name="notification_access_link_text">Turn off notification access</string> <string name="notification_menu_message">To give Google access to your notifications, tap the toggle above next to Google. You can change this access from Settings &gt; In Apps.</string> <string name="notification_onboarding_title">Want to see more contacts?</string> <string name="notification_onboarding_body">To see more relevant contacts and messages, turn on notification access. This means that Google can read notifications from all apps and keep the information private on your phone.</string> <string name="notification_onboarding_dismiss_button_text">NOT NOW</string> <string name="notification_onboarding_learn_more_text">Learn more</string> <string name="notification_onboarding_optin_button_text">GO TO SETTINGS</string> Reading through the new strings is a little disappointing because they only give a (very vague) sales pitch about what the feature is supposed to achieve – helping you to find your contacts and messages – and that it wants permission to do this. However, there isn't even a hint about what users can actually expect to see as an end result. In fact, the most notable thing to take from the wording is that Google is very specific that all data collected for this feature is stored locally on your device and won't be going to the cloud. While privacy is certainly important, and it's not surprise Google wants to be cautious, this means users won't have cross-device syncing or some of the more clever features that rely on server-based processing. Two other small notes can be taken from the text, though they aren't terribly helpful. The first is simply that users can configure which apps will be watched, so it'll be possible to effectively ignore notifications that are misleading to the system or you might not want to have mixing into your results. The second detail is that the option to include or exclude apps from this feature is in Settings –> In Apps, which is currently where apps are enabled for deep search. This might suggest information from notifications will also turn up through the search field, just like deep search does now, but that feels like a bit of a leap in logic. Perhaps there will be more to learn when the next update begins rolling out. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Cody Toombs If you don't live in India (or some other country with painfully slow bandwidth and crippling data caps), I'm not sure you'll see it at all. Even if you are in an area where it's going to roll out, I don't think it has been enabled yet. These things take time to implement and test, and things don't always move super quickly. Joshua So a third world Country or Canada. Got it. Oh wait, nothing comes to Canada. Duder12 Google is moving farther and farther in front of Alexa and Siri. Its going to be embarrassing for the competition if the public finally notices. LondonLeedsFan Maybe in the US - UK won't be getting call features as far as I understand. Lars Jeppesen Neither will Europe or other places. xyz No worries since none of these will be available outside the US so everyone else will stick with the competition. Gfame103 Just enable the got dam calling feature already! XerBlade "It may be a hacky workaround, but at least it gives us an out that doesn't require whispering into a phone mic or walking over to the Home unit to hit a mute button." If this is truly what that's about, seriously, as I keep bringing up pretty much every time I see such extremes being brought up as necessities, wouldn't it be easier than any of those incredibly stupid solutions to just hit the button on your phone instead of using the hotword in the first place? tu3218 Bring it on! Good_Ole_Pinocchio I want new Hardware Google. Software is almost fully baked. I shall wait. F4LL0U7 So this stuff is great, but I'm having some experience-breaking issues on my Nexus 5X and G Watch R. 1. Reminders just don't show up as notifications at all, and automatically get dismissed. This makes them completely useless as reminders! 2. I enter *every* appointment in Google Calendar, and some of them have addresses. This should (and used to) make a very handy "time to leave" card and notification show up when I needed it. Currently, the card and notification do show up, but then get automatically dismissed. When they disappear, that event no longer shows up in my agenda in my Google feed. If it weren't for Google Calendar reminders, I'd completely miss my appointments. Both of these issues have plagued me for months, and have not been fixed even if I do a factory reset. Anyone else experiencing this? Any suggestions? Good_Ole_Pinocchio I haven't experienced those issues personally. You may get a lot more responses over at reddit though. surethom All. I want is a graphical equaliser to reduce the ridiculously high base. Good_Ole_Pinocchio What you need is new hardware from Google. reggjoo Are you rooted? If so, Magisk has many audio mods that will give you the control your looking for(Dolby atmos is one example). If not, maybe the playstore has something, even though they seem to not integrate seamlessly with the system as much. obk88 is using the free spotify account available yet? JD That will never happen Spencer Actually... http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/17/google-home-now-supports-spotify-even-free-accounts-plus-soundcloud-deezer/ Grey When will my phone beep when I say Okay Google again? This is the single most head-scratching, bizarre, insane decision Google has ever made. Does anyone else's Okay Google's on their phone beep them anymore? Makes that sound? Mine make it over bluetooth but not in person. I DON'T GET IT. How do I get this feature back?? It's essential. Willie Chalmers III It makes the noise if it's on Bluetooth. I miss the sound, but I suppose Google considered the fact that if you're asking the assistant something on your phone, you can visually see if it's responding, so only tactile response, a vibration, is necessary There's also the possibility that the noise made Google Assistant feel less conversational and more like a robot, which isn't what Google desires. Grey I think the less conversational thing is what they were going for, but there's tons of problems. For one, it isn't always listening. I have spoken to the phone trying to be conversational and it's just not listening anymore. And two, I'm not looking at my phone!!! That's the point of voice commands!! reggjoo Those settings are not there with the new updates(at least the last two). If anybody can find the "in apps" button, more power to you. I lost the voice function, except in the Google app, after I updated that. Tried all the "solutions" that I could possibly find, and scoured every post. By accident, I was messing around with Google +, and did something, some settings came up, clicked on some, and "viola" everything came back! In apps was back, the beep was back, just like before their update. Do I want to update it again? Not really. akshay7394 It beeps when you trigger it via 'Ok Google', doesn't beep if triggered through the home button long-press gesture. Grey I only use Ok Google. Doesn't beep. akshay7394 Strange; are you referring to Assistant or the older version ? beeps for me :s Total Insecurity On my Google Pixel XL it still beeps like a champ. reggjoo Try to find the solution thru google+, you wouldn't expect any settings to be there for the assistant, but something's there, but I can't remember what I did, and it was by accident. Sina ina Anyone having problem with ok google detection when screen is off ( while chaging ) with this version ? mine is broken right now reggjoo If that's all that's wrong, feel lucky, the update of Google app broke my voice, it only worked in the Google app, after I pressed the home button. Almost 6 hours after I updated it, it went to that state. First it's actions started slowing down, then in any app died, then it stopped launching from the launcher(even though my launcher has OK Google detection built in). After clearing cache, data, uninstalling to previous versions, updating, messing with activity settings, enabling permissions with apps2sd pro, I fixed it by accident. I went to Google +, found some settings in there(wasn't looking for anything about the assistant). From the settings in the app, other settings about the assistant started popping up. Enabled them, and everything started working again, except screen off. I figure I could get that to work again too, but ya gotta know when to say when. I turned off automatic updates, used titanium backup to detach it from the playstore, but Google, sometimes gets around that, and updates anyway, so my fingers are crossed now. I want to enjoy my phone, for a little while, before they screw it up again. Behace When deciding which device to answer from, why can't assistant decide which decides can handle the request then figure out which device recorded the request at the highest decibel? It would be a rather crude way of deciding which device to answer with but it could work, no? Fruity101079 Still no Google Assistant on Nexus devices, while my language is supported... reggjoo What I worry about is breaking what setup I already have. Last few updates broke my voice function (what happened to "from any app button"?) It took almost a month to figure how to get that function back. Eventually, through g+, after trying all the help solutions, that didn't work at all, I figured it out, but I can't remember how now. I don't want to go thru that again. I'm turning off automatic updates, just to protect my setup, even though Google apps always finds a way. I'll shy away from this one, til I hear from various forums about stability problems with setups and older devices. Ryan How about recognizing the Home is handling the request and turning my screen back off? My phone just sits there with the screen on. JG it looks like Google is still working working out the best way to handle multiple always-listening devices Having to press a "Answer here" button, IMHO, kind of defeats the purpose of having hands free, always listening devices. Instead, I think Google should set customized wake up triggers for each device. Right now we have "OK Google" and "Hey Google" trigger phrases. The Google Home and Android Auto could be set to only reply to "Hey Google" while the phone could be set to reply to just "OK Google" triggers. Then I could just say "OK Google, send a text to Mark, let him know I'll be 10min late" and know my phone is going to handle it rather than my Home yelling at me that it still can't send messages. Or maybe even go a step farther. Motorola has had the ability to set personalized trigger phrases for their Moto X line for some years now (mine woke to "Hello Moto X"). I'm sure Google should be able to figure out a means to allow each of my devices to have their own specific wake up trigger. That might also help cut down on false triggers in multi-Home houses. "Hey Bedroom Home, what time is it" won't accidentally trigger both Bedroom Home and Living Room Home. reggjoo I said almost the same thing a while ago, as far as the trigger word goes. Why Google, still holds onto "OK Google" just to use voice, is beyond me. Some will say that changing it will mess with their servers, but no, how could it, all the info they collect on you, your habits, etc.. I'm sure there's enough space in there for personalized voice commands. Your idea is good. xyz US only? Lame. When is Google going to bring independence day to the rest of the world? JG There's actually nothing special to say here – Google just added a new line for activities scheduled for July 4th, which is Independence Day in the United States. I'm curious as to this string... Is Google going to display my personal information (from Calendar et al) reminding me I need to take potato salad to Aunt Em's pool party... Or will it display information about near by activities, like when my local municipality's fire works display is scheduled... Or is Google going to "host" their own special Independence Day activities? And will other holidays get similar treatment in the future? Blake Sinnett So I've been thinking ever since this was posted. What if you could connect Duo for audio calls? It would certainly improve quality. They mention "phone services" but that could be Duo, Skype, etc. What if they made it possible for apps to connect to the Google Home calling feature? Probably not, but it would be neat if that happened.

By Chris Duckett | June 9, 2017 -- 01:43 GMT (18:43 PDT) | Topic: Innovation SoftBank has announced that it has reached an agreement with Alphabet to purchase Boston Dynamics, and will also snap up Japanese bipedal robotics company Schaft. Details of the deal are scant, with the sale price not disclosed and the transaction pending regulatory approval. "There are many issues we still cannot solve by ourselves with human capabilities," SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son said. "Smart robotics are going to be a key driver of the next stage of the information revolution, and ... Boston Dynamics are the clear technology leaders in advanced dynamic robots." Over a year ago, it was reported Google mothership Alphabet had put Boston Dynamics up for sale. The robotics company was purchased by Google for $500 million in 2013. Schaft was also purchased by Google in the same year. SoftBank is far from a stranger to the realm of robots, with its Pepper robot selling out in under a minute when it was first offered to the market in 2015. Pepper is set to be used as a social robotics research platform at the Queensland University of Technology. Earlier this year, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said robots should be taxed at the same level as the people they replace to help fund better social services and education. "Right now, if a human worker does $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed. If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you'd think we'd tax the robot at a similar level," he said.

Digital Footprints Paint An Eerily Accurate Picture Of Europe's Refugees George Dvorsky Jun 9, 2017, 12:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  digital footprints google google search information technology migrant flows migration online searchers privacy refugees search engines smartphones someone is always watching technology Share Using search data collected by Google, researchers at the Pew Research Center have reconstructed the journeys taken by refugees flowing into Europe from the Middle East. It represents a new way of tracking migration patterns — but the technique could eventually lead to misuse. Photo: AP/Muhammed Muheisen In 2015 and 2016, some 2.5 million refugees left Syria and Iraq in search of asylum in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland. A good portion of these migrants had smartphones, which they used to access maps, locate safe and open border crossings, source details about their destination, and seek travel advice from social media. By doing so — and completely unbeknownst to them — the refugees left a trail of digital breadcrumbs behind them that would eventually be used by the Pew Research Center to recreate their journey in startling detail. Image: Pew Research Center The information produced by these migrants was made available to the Pew researchers via publicly accessible search data from Google Trends, and they show the paths taken by refugees, the times of day they were most likely to make their perilous journeys, and their eventual destination points. The resulting Pew report, titled "The Digital Footprint of Europe's Refugees", was published earlier today. When conducting the analysis, the researchers focused on a surprisingly simple formula: Look for trends in Arabic language search queries originating in non-Arabic language speaking countries. Most refugees crossed into Greece from Turkey by sea, before continuing on to final destinations in Europe. The presence of the migrants in these countries — where Arabic is spoken at a minimal rate — accounted for the disproportionate number of Arabic-language searches done in Turkey and elsewhere during the period 2015-16, which was the period covered in the new study. Image: Pew Research Center When comparing search terms to migration data collected by government authorities, the researchers came up with several interesting correlations. For example, Google searches in Arabic for the word "Greece" mirrored fluctuations in the number of refugees crossing the Aegean Sea to Greece. And by matching the search term "smuggler" with "Greece", the researchers were able to determine how the migrants planned their journeys. The queries even allowed the researchers to pinpoint the time of day migrants were most likely to make their way across the Mediterranean; searches for "Greece" typically happened during the early morning hours, when the chances of being detected were minimal. Revealingly, Arabic-language searches for "Greece" from within Turkey reached a peak in August 2015, and exactly two months later, the volume of migrants arriving in Greece also peaked. This two month gap happens to be the time it takes to process asylum seekers travelling between the two countries. Image: Pew Research Center The search patterns also closely mirrored asylum applications once the refugees were in Europe. Once in Europe, around 57 per cent of refugees applied for asylum in Germany. Similar to Turkey, Germany's population is largely non-Arabic speaking, and the number of asylum applications in Germany matched online Arabic search from within Germany. Much of this analysis certain seems intuitive, and even a bit of a no-brainer. Of course we can track migration patterns by matching them to search queries. But this exercise does represent an important proof of concept. This technique certainly helps during after-the-fact analyses like this one, but it could conceivably be used by government agencies or other groups to track the movements of refugees in real-time. This would allow them to anticipate their movements, and even possibly set up barriers to entry (both physical and bureaucratic). On a positive side, it could alert coast guard personnel to the presence of migrant ships on the ocean, or other high-risk migration strategies. Moving forward, Google will need to be aware of how its data may be used and misused — and guard its data accordingly. We reached out to Google for comment but had not heard back at time of writing.

Google is excited about receiving city support for its interest in downtown San Jose, amid the search giant’s evaluation of opportunities in the suddenly red-hot Diridon station district. By George Avalos | gavalos@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: June 8, 2017 at 5:45 pm | UPDATED: June 8, 2017 at 7:34 pm SAN JOSE — Google is excited about receiving city support for its interest in downtown San Jose, the search giant said Thursday, amid its evaluation of opportunities in the suddenly red-hot Diridon Station district. San Jose officials this week said Google is in talks with the city to create a massive tech campus downtown, near the Diridon train station and SAP Center, that could accommodate up to 20,000 jobs and transform the area into a transit-oriented tech village. “We’re excited to have the support of the San Jose city council as we evaluate our options at Diridon Station,” a Google spokesperson said Thursday. Those were Google’s first comments about the situation. Mountain View-based Google and the city of San Jose are discussing a potential mixed-used development that could include more than 6 million square feet of office and research space, potentially making it the company’s largest collection of tech offices. If built, it would be larger than the search giant’s roughly 3.1-million-square-foot Mountain View headquarters, known as the Googleplex, which currently is its biggest U.S. work hub. “We look forward to collaborating with officials and community members,” Google said in comments emailed to this newspaper on Thursday. Google’s expansion plans could dovetail with San Jose’s own quest to maximize transit links in and out of Diridon Station. The area is deemed attractive for offices, homes and retail because it’s a hub for Amtrak, Caltrain and a light-rail system. It’s also slated for a BART station and a possible high-speed rail line connection, although those won’t materialize for years. All the transit upgrades could increase the number of commuters to downtown San Jose by eight-fold. “I had reached out several times to Google the last few years,” San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo told this newspaper earlier this week, referring to the possibility of the tech giant entering the city’s downtown. In prepared remarks this week, Liccardo said, “Based on our conversations with Google, we share a collective vision for the future of this space, a vision of urban design that will invite the public into the station.” Google’s potential push into downtown would be a game changer for the city. At present, San Jose has about 10 million square feet of offices. Therefore, 6 million additional square feet would make for a huge addition to the downtown skyline. “San Jose has been trolling for this big fish for quite some time,” said Chad Leiker, a first vice president with Kidder Mathews, a commercial realty brokerage. “The city will do everything it can to make Google happen for San Jose.” Tags:  Commercial Real Estate Economy Google Jobs San Jose City Council San Jose Mayor Technology George Avalos George Avalos is a business reporter for the Bay Area News Group.

jalopnik Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Jalopnik Reviews Foxtrot Alpha Black Flag Truck Yeah Lanesplitter The Garage Thrill To The Last Air-Cooled Car Volkswagen Ever Designed Jason TorchinskyYesterday 8:00pm Filed to: Torchlopnik Volkswagen Air-cooled 39 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Air-cooling was a hallmark of Volkswagen since it began in the late 1930s. Throughout most of the 20th century, VW was motoring free from the cruel, wet tyranny of water—heavy, leaky radiators, and winter’s cold, looming threat of ice. The whole atmosphere was coolant for a VW, and all was good. Until it wasn’t. Right at the very end of the air-cooled era, VW made one last air-cooled car: it’s barely known in the U.S., and has a tricky-to-Google name. The car is the Volkswgaen Gol. That missing ‘f’ on the end is what makes it tricky to Google, since everyone just assumes you meant to type “Golf.” But it’s not Golf, it’s Gol, as in Portuguese for goal, because of course this interesting VW is Brazilian. It wasn’t the last air-cooled VW made, not by a long shot: the Beetle was made up until 2003 in Mexico, and the VW Type 2 Kombi, which was made up until 2013, switched to water-cooling in 2005. These cars, though, were designed decades before the Gol, which was released in 1980. Advertisement The Gol is actually very unlike nearly every other air-cooled VW made, in that it uses a front-mounted engine, in a body that looks far more like the first generation of water-cooled VWs like the Passat/Dasher and Golf/Rabbit than any of the old, generally rounder air-cooled VWs. It’s not the first time VW ever put the air-cooled flat-four up front, either: the very crude and utilitarian Basistransporter/Hormiga truck has that honor. Another Weird Air-Cooled VW You've Never Heard Of: Basistransporter You know that jerk at your local vinatge VW club who made you look like an ass because you…Read more The technical origins of the VW Gol come from a one-off prototype made by Volkswagen back in 1969, called EA 276. This was an especially interesting time at Volkswagen, because it was clear that the iconic and increasingly archaic Beetle was going to need a replacement, and there were several schools of thought about what this should be. One path was the EA 266, a revolutionary and fascinating mid-engined car, co-developed with Porsche. As fascinating as it was, this was not the path that Volkswagen would travel. This Fascinating Stillborn VW Prototype Would Have Been Revolutionary By the late '60s, VW was in a legitimate full-on panic about replacing the Beetle: somehow,…Read more Instead, Volkswagen’s future came with the purchase, in 1965, of Auto Union, and then, in 1969, NSU. These companies had a lot of experience with water-cooled, front-engine designs, and that proved to be VW’s ride to modernity. Still, nothing was really certain in 1969, which is why EA 276 was built: a modern-looking, unibody hatchback design, front-engined, with front-wheel drive, but to hedge the bets a little, that engine was the same old air-cooled flat-four right out of the Beetle. Advertisement Sponsored When the Auto Union/NSU water-cooled FWD path took over, a half-measure like EA276 just wasn’t needed, so it stayed a forgotten and lonely little one-off. But EA 276 was remembered, by Volkswagen’s Brazilian branch in the early 1970s. By then the Passat and Golf were out, and VW’s future was clear. VW Brazil also saw the need to replace the aging Beetle (they called it the Fusca), and they actually came closest of anyone to actually doing so, with the Brasilia. Volkswagen Once Tried To Kill A Journalist Because Of This Car Yep, that's right. As far as I can tell, this incident where a Brazilian auto journalist was…Read more The Brasilia was pretty successful as a Beetle replacement, but it was really just a new, more modern suit on the bones of the Beetle. The chassis was just the slightly wider Ghia chassis, and the car was still rear-engine/rear-drive, using all the usual Beetle mechanicals. The Brasilia. Not the 0cc/ 0hp no-engine in front, driving none of the wheels It wasn’t quite enough for a real replacement, so VW Brazil looked to the new generation of Volkswagens for inspiration. They took the Audi 80/Audi Fox platform and shortened it a bit, turning it into what they called the BX platform. The new body was clean, airy, and handsome, in the same understated way as VW’s new watercooled cars. It utilized the space quite well, and with the spare tire stuck in the engine bay, there was a good amount of room in the hatch. Advertisement So now VW Brazil had a modern hatchback body that was styled in the same crisp, angular vocabulary as the Passat and Golf, but they didn’t have a new inline, water-cooled, maybe transverse engine to throw in it, nor the resources to actually develop one. What they did have was plenty of air-cooled flat-four engines, so that’s what they used, flipping it around and having it drive the front wheels of the Gol. The engine was tweaked a bit from its usual configuration in the rear. Since airflow would be coming in hard and fast right from a grille directly in front of the engine, the fan was moved from its traditional location behind the generator/alternator and hidden in a shroud to a new place, up front and proud, in front of the alternator. This new fan was plastic and often yellow and hard to miss, and a whole new fan shroud and air ducting system was developed to maximize all this air. The cooling up front proved to be so effective that the need for an oil cooler was gone, so gone was the oil cooler. The Gol at first just got the smaller 1.3-liter flat-four, which only made about 42 horsepower, but it was clear people wanted something less pokey, so the next year, 1981, the 1600cc engine was offered, with twin carbs and making a truly skull-scorching 51 hp. Advertisement There was even a fantastic little pickup-truck version, the Saviero, Volkswagen’s third production air-cooled pickup truck, after the Type 2 pickup and the Basistransporter. The resulting car is a fascinating missing link of Volkswagens. It’s possibly the only true transitionary car VW developed during their dramatic architectural shift from air-cooled, rear-mounted, RWD opposed engines to water-cooled, front-mounted FWD inline engines. Other Volkswagens have made transitions of technology, too—the Type 2 has gone from air- to water-cooling twice (once with the Vanagon and the Wasserboxer engines in the 1980s, and then later with the previous-gen bay-window buses getting inline water-cooled engines and radiators in Mexico, and later Brazil). The Gol eventually proved its status as a vehicle of transition by metamorphosing into a modern-era, water-cooled VW in 1984, when tooling from Germany allowed the production of a water-cooled, inline four for the Gol. The 1.8-liter water-cooled Gol was sold as the hot one With the switch to water-cooling, the Gol arguably became more viable and practical, but, to me, a lot less interesting. We got the water-cooled Gol here later on as the VW Fox, which has the distinction of being both the first Brazilian-built VW sold in the U.S., and one of the most boring VWs ever sold in the U.S. Though the shooting-brake wagon version was pretty cool. Advertisement Advertisement The last holdout of air-cooling was Porsche, another descendant of the venerable Beetle, and Porsche managed to keep using the atmosphere as coolant until 1998. Emissions regulations were the primary reason to switch to liquid cooling, and today I can’t think of a single mass-market car that’s cooled by air. That just makes the first-gen VW Gol all the more special, then. It’s the swan song of Volkswagen’s air-cooled engineering, and that makes me, however irrationally, a bit sad. Don’t be down, though: motorcycles still like to be air-cooled, and maybe if we end up in some water-starved Mad Max-like future distopia, the one bright spot may be the return of that familiar air-cooled clatter as we haul ass, trying to outrun those filthy cannibals.

Release notes for Play Services v11 have been posted with a new API for smooth SMS verification and several significant additions and deprecations Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 3:32pm PDTJun 8, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 21 Share on Twitter Total Shares61 Development News Now that Google is through with its biggest developer conference of the year, it's time to deliver a few updates and fulfill some of the promises made during the event. Some of that is happening through and update to Play services. Google posted the release notes for the update and it includes a lot of additions, both big and small, and a few deprecations. For the non-developers in the crowd, most of this stuff isn't going to matter all that much, but there is one new feature that might catch their interest. A new API will allow apps to perform SMS verifications without accessing the SMS history. It's probably not a big change for users, and developers will still have to implement some changes to their app and server code before it can be used, but it means there will be fewer apps with an excuse to poke around in your SMS messages. There are quite a few changes to the different APIs provided by Play services, and developers should definitely check out the full list here. Here are a few particularly interesting things worth highlighting: SmsRetriever API is the SMS verification API mentioned above. It allows apps to listen for incoming SMS messages intended for them without asking users for permission to read all of their messages. This means phone number verifications can be entirely seamless with no authorization dialogs or manual steps to copy a code from a text message. It works by giving a unique hash to apps so they can pass it back to the developer's server. That hash should then be sent via SMS to the user's phone and parsed by Play services. Once a message with the hash is identified, it will be passed directly to the primary app. The RemoteMediaPlayer class has been deprecated from the Cast API. If you're using the Cast SDK v2, there is a guide available for migrating to Cast SDK v3. As we were told during I/O, all developers are now free to build Instant Apps. Details can be found here. Significant additions to Nearby and SafetyNet APIs, as well as some handy new classes for working with the Fused Location Provider and Awareness capabilities. If you haven't already done it, go to the SDK Manager in Android Studio or the one included with the Android SDK and update the Google repository to get started with the latest APIs.

David Onter > "Significant additions to SafetyNet APIs" I don't trust this part right here Bewear SafetyNet is getting more evil. Trooper311 More like Skynet. Daniel Tbh, it's all those rooting apps we're hearing about that made them want to put in all theses APIs. Hackers make the problems, tinkers suffer. That's life I guess.

The Three Nutritional Principles That Everyone Agrees On Showdown: Which Music Streaming Service Is Best? Patrick Lucas Austin Jun 9, 2017, 11:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple music feature microsoft music pandora spotify streaming streaming music video feature Share The announcement of Apple's music bumpin' HomePod means you might be reconsidering which streaming service you use. To be honest, going from one to another might not be that big of a leap. Most streaming services do share a variety of similarities. They work on whatever smartphone you own, usually support streaming to speakers through Airplay or Google Cast, and its premium service lets you stream music on-demand and save it for offline listening. Of course, not all music services are created equal. What might work with your Sonos may not play nice with your Amazon Echo, and what your upcoming HomePod will play isn't exactly third-party software. Image credit: Leon Neal/Getty Spotify (iOS, Android, Desktop) Oh, Spotify. You're the golden child of music streaming, and for good reason. It works basically everywhere (even on Linux), and has all the music you could ask for. In addition to a radio and rotating selection of playlists, the company also features a lot of not-so-musical content, including speeches, poetry and popular podcasts. The $11.99 premium subscription and $17.99 family plan are standard procedure, with the latter providing premium features for up to six family members. Spotify is a pretty solid music streamer. If you don't have your heart set on any particular service, it isn't a bad start to figuring out which one works for you. It doesn't have Jay Z though, so… yeah. Apple Music (iOS, Android, Desktop) If you're an Apple fan, curious about the upcoming HomePod, or an Android user who wants to buck the trend, try Apple Music. The on-demand streaming service works with every Apple device, as well as on Android. If you don't want to pay for it, you can still listen to Beats 1 Radio for free. Playlists and radio stations are updated consistently, and exclusive content from artists is a great way to find new sounds. Its subscription plan starts at $11.99 per month, and features a $17.99 family plan for up to six members. It's the (surprise!) only music streaming service that will work with Apple's HomePod speaker, making it the only choice if you want to use it to blast tunes from anywhere besides your iTunes library. Unfortunately, Apple Music isn't supported on voice assistant devices, and more speakers support services like Spotify or Pandora. Also, it lives in iTunes, which means you might find it a little slow every once in a while. Google Play Music (iOS, Android, Desktop) Google's Play Music! You can add up to 50,000 of your own tunes to your account and stream them anywhere. Play Music also handles your podcasts. Putting all your audio content in a single location is a definite boon if you — like me — oscillate like Newton's cradle between songs and podcasts. Google's catalogue offers 35 million songs for on-demand listening, putting in the same range as the competition. To sweeten the deal, a subscription to Google Play Music also includes free access to YouTube Red, the company's premium tier for YouTube. Pairing it with Google Home gives you a voice assistant that also works well with your music library. Google would be doing itself a service by integrating audiobooks into its Play Music service. Pandora Radio (iOS, Android, Desktop) Pandora is great for casual listeners to music, people who want something on in the background while they do dishes or write blog posts. Its ad-supported option lets you create personalised stations while its $US4.99 ($7) option unlocks unlimited skips and replays, higher quality music, and offline station listening. $US9.99 ($13) gets you on-demand streaming, putting it on par with other streaming services. You can listen to Pandora basically anywhere, from your smartphone to your smart TV. It's compatible with voice assistants such as the Amazon Echo, Google Chrome, and a variety of connected speakers. Pandora's legacy as a streaming radio platform bites it in the arse when it comes to on-demand streaming. Some songs in its catalogue are licensed for on-demand streaming while others will only play when they come up in Pandora's radio, a distinction that leaves me dissatisfied. Microsoft Groove (iOS, Android, Windows) Xbox fans and die-hard Windows Phone or Windows 10 users should check out Microsoft Groove. The platform is host to over 38 million songs (even Jay Z!), and lets you integrate your own library as long as it's stored on Microsoft's OneDrive cloud storage service. You can sync your offline music with up to five devices (including iOS and Android devices). The minimal interface also looks cool, and ties in with the rest of Microsoft's aesthetic. Its paid service, Groove Music Pass, starts at $11.99 per month after a 30 day free trial. With no way to add other users to your Groove account, the service isn't family-friendly. It's also unsupported by nearly every manufacturer except Microsoft, so getting your tunes on anything that isn't a Sonos, smartphone or computer is out of the question. Its minimal interface looks great for featuring individual artists but is a hassle if you're looking for something specific, like a playlist or a running mix. Also, that 30 day free trial is pretty short, considering Apple's three month free trial offer and Spotify's three month $0.99 trial (cheapskates). Tidal (iOS, Android, Desktop) Come for the Jay Z and 40 million songs, stay for the fan-friendly perks like exclusive access to pre-sale concert tickets and exclusive music videos. You can use Tidal on any smartphone or desktop, and it plays nice with Sonos music streaming speakers. Its upcoming artist section, Tidal Rising, highlights up and coming musicians looking to break into mainstream, which is arguably the best and most intriguing aspect of any music streaming service. It also boasts some high quality music depending on your subscription. Premium streams max out at AAC 320 kbps, while HiFi music uses "lossless" quality uncompressed tracks. Tidal's still lacking some polish, as well as actual support from a variety of electronics manufacturers. You can't control the service from Amazon's Echo or Google Home. And while $11.99 is a great price for Tidal's premium service, $23.99 for its HiFi plan seems excessive. Also, its $17.99 family plan (and $35.99 HiFi version) supports five instead of six users.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI AI Weekly: Apple and Google are making smartphones smarter Blaise Zerega@BeeZee June 8, 2017 6:12 PM It’s happening again. Smartphones are getting smarter. At WWDC this week Apple announced Core ML, a programming framework for app developers seeking to run machine learning models on iPhones and other devices. Think of this as AI on your iPhone, which means your favorite apps may soon intuitively know what you want to do with them. Meanwhile, Google made a similar announcement a few weeks ago at its I/O developer conference. The company’s new TensorFlow Lite programming framework will make it possible to run machine learning models on Android devices. And these announcements are in addition to Google Assistant now being available for the iPhone. (It’s already become my most used app.) So what does this mean? These moves suggest yet a third front for more artificial intelligence battles by the tech giants. First, intelligent assistants: Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. Second, smart speakers: Amazon Echo, Google Home, and the new Apple HomePod. And third: smartphones and their apps. Of course, Microsoft, Samsung, and others may stir things up further.

This revelation came to light on a recent trip to Paris. While navigating to Notre Dame with the help of Google Maps, I had my first introduction to contextual advertisements “Did I wish to visit a Geox store on the way?” How did Google know I liked Geox? Were they able to make an intelligent match simply from all the data they have collecting from my phone over the years? This was disconcerting, it gave me a feeling not quite to the level of being stalked, but a clear sense that I was though definitely always trailed and profiled. Separately, the meteoric rise of technology companies in 2017, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Tencent and Alibaba up almost 30-40% after a strong 2016 and an innocuous query by a friend on how much of my wealth was in technology names made me question the obvious. What is in these companies that help them command a market capitalization way above their brick and mortar peers? Firstly, a subscriber base of 400 mn for Alibaba or 800 mn for Tencent was simply unheard of even for the likes of Unilever and Nestle as there always a question of how to stay relevant for a disparate mass of consumer base across countries and continents. Secondly, how to “know” the consumer better and extract more value from the same consumer? Clearly these technology companies realized way earlier than their brick and mortar peers that future winners of corporate battles would be determined by who controls and knows the consumer data best. Indeed data is the next big thing. For a company like Tencent, the challenge is to ensure attractiveness of its platforms like Weixin/WeChat, Qzone so that user engagement doesn’t falter while also carefully exploring opportunities like advertisements, lai see or red packet transfers, taxi booking or e-commerce. The underlying message is that the consumer/user comes first; don’t dilute his/her experience to risk that they could turn away from the platform. This is a text book way of treating customers but not based on a gut feeling but rather, sifting through tons and tons of data. Along the way, if the incumbents are sleepy like the SOE banks in China, there is a windfall of opportunity for these big data companies like Lufax, Ant financial and Webank as they access risk profiles better and tap an untouched segment of retail and SME & channel financing. Alipay has nearly 450mn active users with 160 mn daily transactions while Lufax has ramped up to 3.5 mn active customers with retail transaction volume of RMB650 bn in 2015. Equally impressive has been the progress made by Tencent in broad-basing the appeal of its payments platform. Compared to the average transaction fees of 100-125 bps by established credit card companies, Tencent charges large commercial merchants like Starbucks, Yum China merely 60 bps for Tenpay. The double advantage of mobile wallet convenience and competitive charges backed by a large user base has boosted WeChat pay’s share of Starbucks China sales to nearly 30%. Similarly, Yum China also has 31% of sales from mobile payments largely driven by WeChat pay. Number of times per day that WeChat users open WeChat [Source: WeChat Economics Social Influence Analytical Report, CAICT, Mirae Asset, Sept 2016] User time spend in different functions of WeChat app [Source: Tencent Tech Channel CTAR 2015/2016] Where the big data has taken battle to the next level is having collected so much information about their humongous data base, these companies are launching bespoke promotions to their users, a strategy of delighting consumer by making him feel special. The million dollar question is what happens next to the other incumbent businesses? An easy option would be to partner with technology companies e.g. Suning and Intime with Alibaba, Yonghui with JD.com. A tougher but more sustainable way would be to invest in technology, reinvent processes and systems with the focus on the consumer. This has been well achieved by private sector banks like ICICI Bank and HDFC bank in India where more than 70% of the transactions are made online. These banks having refreshed internet banking solutions, launched online wallets and other novel mobile based payment solutions and have successfully withstood the challenge from Alibaba funded financial technology companies like Paytms. However, such examples remain are far and few. A bigger question from a medium term to long term perspective is should these technology companies continue to emerge bigger and stronger, do we then face a bigger risk of having a significant part of daily life being accessed and controlled by a few large companies?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Amazon.com Is Open to Alexa Working With Apple's Siri Apple probably should partner with Amazon, but won't. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jun 8, 2017 at 8:01PM Two virtual heads are better than one. Despite being the first major tech company to release a virtual assistant, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has fallen behind the competition, most notably Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa. That's especially true in the battle over the smart home, where Alexa has become a powerful assistant thanks to Amazon opening up Alexa as a platform back in 2015; Alexa now knows over 13,000 third-party Skills. Meanwhile, Apple and Amazon have had numerous standoffs across different competitive areas. One of these just ended, with Apple finally announcing earlier this month that Amazon Prime Video would be coming to Apple TV. Given the tensions, it would seem unlikely that Alexa and Siri will ever get along and work together, but it appears that at least Amazon is open to the idea. Siri powers the new HomePod. Image source: Apple. Apple probably should, but won't At the Wired Business Conference yesterday, Amazon hardware chief David Limp said that Alexa and Siri should be able to cooperate, according to USA Today. Limp said, "You should be able to tell 'Alexa, ask Siri X.'" The executive said he'd be open to Apple or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google exploring a potential partnership, although Limp acknowledged the unlikelihood of that happening. There's little doubt that consumers would prefer the various virtual assistants in their lives being able to communicate with each other, which is what should matter most. But rivals are probably more interested in using virtual assistants as potentially differentiating factors. For example, Google is betting that Google Home can answer a much broader set of questions, tapping into the search engine's "featured snippets" and relaying those through Google Home. While the implementation of that has approach been heavily criticized, if Google can improve the execution, that could be a compelling advantage for Google Home over Echo, and a feature that Google would rightly be averse to sharing. Apple's HomePod was just announced and won't be available until December. The Mac maker is positioning its smart speaker at the premium end of the spectrum, hoping that high-fidelity audio will win over consumers -- its second attempt in as many years. However, Apple has been working on its smart home platform for years (HomeKit was released in 2014), which Siri on HomePod will be able to tap into, but Apple has very little to show for it thus far. The company only opened up Siri to third-party developers last year. With that backdrop, if Apple were to theoretically partner with Amazon so that Alexa and Siri could interface with each other, it would probably benefit Apple more than Amazon, since Siri could ask Alexa to perform smart home tasks, and Alexa is capable of a whole lot more of those. Still, it probably won't happen. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Release notes for Play Services v11 have been posted with a new API for smooth SMS verification and several significant additions and deprecations Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 3:32pm PDTJun 8, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 21 Share on Twitter Total Shares61 Development News Now that Google is through with its biggest developer conference of the year, it's time to deliver a few updates and fulfill some of the promises made during the event. Some of that is happening through and update to Play services. Google posted the release notes for the update and it includes a lot of additions, both big and small, and a few deprecations. For the non-developers in the crowd, most of this stuff isn't going to matter all that much, but there is one new feature that might catch their interest. A new API will allow apps to perform SMS verifications without accessing the SMS history. It's probably not a big change for users, and developers will still have to implement some changes to their app and server code before it can be used, but it means there will be fewer apps with an excuse to poke around in your SMS messages. There are quite a few changes to the different APIs provided by Play services, and developers should definitely check out the full list here. Here are a few particularly interesting things worth highlighting: SmsRetriever API is the SMS verification API mentioned above. It allows apps to listen for incoming SMS messages intended for them without asking users for permission to read all of their messages. This means phone number verifications can be entirely seamless with no authorization dialogs or manual steps to copy a code from a text message. It works by giving a unique hash to apps so they can pass it back to the developer's server. That hash should then be sent via SMS to the user's phone and parsed by Play services. Once a message with the hash is identified, it will be passed directly to the primary app. The RemoteMediaPlayer class has been deprecated from the Cast API. If you're using the Cast SDK v2, there is a guide available for migrating to Cast SDK v3. As we were told during I/O, all developers are now free to build Instant Apps. Details can be found here. Significant additions to Nearby and SafetyNet APIs, as well as some handy new classes for working with the Fused Location Provider and Awareness capabilities. If you haven't already done it, go to the SDK Manager in Android Studio or the one included with the Android SDK and update the Google repository to get started with the latest APIs.

up next: now reading: David Brooks, Billions, and the Paradox of Charitable Giving PBS David Brooks, Billions, and the Paradox of Charitable Giving By John Tamny June 09, 2017 PBS X Story Stream recent articles Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... In a recent column for the New York Times, David Brooks asked “What would I do if I had a billion bucks to use for good?”  The very question posed by Brooks about how he would give away $1 billion raises others. For one, while it’s most certainly their money to handle as they wish, not asked enough is why the superrich think their abundant skills in the commercial space render them experts at charity.  Brooks certainly didn’t ask this question, and it’s passing strange considering his regular columns throughout Election 2016 about Donald Trump’s total lack of qualification for the job of President.  Wise minds can disagree on the latter (I agree with Brooks about Trump, but for different reasons), but if success at building a global real estate brand doesn’t necessarily correlate with governing success, why isn’t Brooks equally skeptical about high commercial achievers knowing how to do “good” with their charitable giving? It’s also worth commenting on Brooks’ suggestion that the creation of wealth isn’t itself necessarily good.  More realistically, it should be asked why the need to do “good” after the act of creating wealth? Figure that Google has minted many billionaires, but who among us could live without it? Notable here is that Google Maps has made navigation of cities by the blind increasingly possible.  Thinking about cars, Elon Musk’s Tesla has made him a billionaire many times over.  Should he quit now to do “good”? It’s worth asking because while left and right can quibble over subsidies enjoyed by Tesla (I say Musk’s Tesla holdings would be worth even more without them), this innovative automaker is inching ever closer to producing cars that don’t require a driver.  If so, readers might stop and imagine what this will mean for the young, blind, elderly and able-bodied adults in need of safe transportation, not to mention what it will mean for families less likely to get the permanently life-altering call about the death of a loved one in an automobile accident entirely caused by human error.  In terms of good, it seems Musk could do the world an exponentially greater turn through feverish, and wealth enhancing pursuit of transportation innovations that make the roads much safer.  Notable here is that Google too is directing many of its billions toward driverless technology.    John D. Rockefeller contributed $500,000 toward a cure for scarlet fever after losing a grandson to it, his billions continue to inform charity today, but no reasonable person would suggest his or his heirs’ charitable endeavors measure up in terms of living standard enhancement to what he achieved in his pursuit of profits.  Goodness, days used to end at night before Rockefeller literally lit up evenings through broad access to kerosene, and then does anyone want to contemplate how comparatively bleak life was before Rockefeller’s refined oil met Henry Ford’s mass-produced cars? In short, there’s nothing about the pursuit of wealth and profits that is the opposite of doing “good,” as Brooks seemingly alludes.  And because there isn’t, it’s worth asking why the superrich are so often pressured to remove their talent and wealth from the marketplace in favor of charity.  It’s the equivalent of sports fans telling otherworldly Golden State Warriors guard Steph Curry that he’s made enough money in basketball, so now it’s time to pursue NFL stardom as a defensive end.  Ok, but rushing the passer is not where Curry’s skills presumably lie.  And while the latter is a statement of the obvious, why isn’t it similarly obvious to say that commercial genius has little to do with impactful giving to charities? Along the lines of the above, what if Rockefeller had pursued a third commercial fortune, and Bill Gates a second one after Microsoft as opposed to focusing his energies on his and his wife’s foundation? Warren Buffett famously co-founded the “Giving Pledge” that has Brooks positively frisky, but can anyone say with a straight face that Buffett’s charitable endeavors have improved the world more than his certain genius as a capital allocator? Why once again do the self-proclaimed serious thinkers so confidently bash our 45th president for exiting his swimming lane, but out of the mouth’s other side rhapsodize about billionaires shunning the source of their wealth in favor of the charitable work that has little to do with their existing abilities? Thinking about Buffett in particular, he’s long explained his aversion to technology stocks (including Microsoft despite his multi-decade friendship with Gates) as being a function of him not properly understanding the underlying businesses.  Fair enough, figure that his investment track record justifies his decision to largely avoid tech stocks, but why doesn’t Buffett think his investment approach should similarly inform his approach to charitable giving? Does he really and truly understand where the charitable impact will be greatest in terms of curing heart disease or cancer, erasing malaria and undrinkable water in the world’s poorest parts, or fixing the worst neighborhoods in the United States?  And if not, does he know who does have high-return ability when it comes to parceling out money? Stressing yet again that it’s their money to do with as they please, let’s never forget that capitalistic genius of the billionaire variety has improved global living standards in exponentially greater fashion than have charities.  In that case, is it really charitable for the world’s capitalistic talents to deprive the world of the skills and capital that improve it the most? Back to Brooks, in a passage that the more self-aware among us would likely never type out, he wrote “Now all I need is a hedge fund to get started,” if he wants to have a billion to give out.  Well, if we ignore for the purposes of this column just how impressively insulting is his insinuation that hedge fund wealth comes easy (Brooks is plainly unaware that the vast majority of such funds fail), Brooks once again spent Election 2016 mocking the pretense of Trump for trying to play a politician.  Ok, but right or wrong, people, including a former President in Nixon, have been telling Trump for decades that he’s meant for presidential politics.  On the other hand, it’s safe to say not many investors have asked Brooks to give up his musings about public policy and life in order to allocate capital. And while Brooks hasn’t revealed any observable qualities as healer of people or communities, this hasn’t stopped him from writing haughtily about what he would do with his billions if he gave up his writing in pursuit of allegedly easy hedge fund wealth.  But since Brooks isn’t about to be handed hundreds of millions in order to apply his substantial IQ to investing, it’s safe to presume that his columns, books, television appearances and speeches provide him with an annual earnings that place him well within the 1 percent.  If so, and if he’s certain about his ability to do good in the way that Trump is about making America great again, he might personally fund one of the “collectives” he’s talking about in order to see if he knows any more about healing than does our president about governing.  John Tamny is editor of RealClearMarkets, a Senior Fellow in Economics at Reason Foundation, and a senior economic adviser to Toreador Research and Trading (www.trtadvisors.com).

Google is acknowledging this reality by expanding its Google Art Project — launched in 2011 to link users with art collections around the world, online — to include fashion. The new project, “We Wear Culture,” which went live Thursday, uses Google’s technology to connect fashion lovers to collections and exhibits at museums and other institutions, giving them the ability to not only view a garment, but to zoom in on the hem of a dress, examine a sleeve or a bit of embroidery on a gown up close, wander around an atelier, or sit down with Metropolitan Museum of Art costume restorers. The project includes more 180 cultural institutions, including the Met’s Costume Institute, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, Japan’s Kyoto Costume Institute, and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. It comprises over 30,000 garments. Latest business videos The site also offers specially organized exhibits. You can click your way to, for example, a photo exhibit on Tokyo Street Style, or an exploration of women’s gowns in the 18th century. You can search by designer, or by their muse — examining, say, Marilyn Monroe’s love of Ferragamo stiletto heels, with the Museo Salvatore Ferragamo in Florence, Italy. At a preview demonstration this week, Amit Sood, director of the Google Cultural Institute and designer of the Google Art Project (now called Google Arts & Culture) explained that he wasn’t initially clued into the possibilities for fashion, because at the Mountain View company, “We all wear hoodies.” But, he said, collaborating with an institution like the Met showed him that “art and fashion have a long history together.” The idea behind the project, he said, is to tell the story — or rather, the multiple stories — behind fashion. There are several virtual reality films included in the project. A 360-degree video displays the Met’s preservation studio, with conservators explaining how they keep delicate clothing strong enough for display — one of them explaining, for example, how the team uses needles designed for eye surgeons. It is the ultimate fragility of clothes, though, that makes the project appealing to museum curators, explained Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute’s head curator — whereas many garments are too delicate to be permanently displayed, digitizing a collection makes it viewable forever. The Costume Institute has provided 500 of the objects on display, noted Loic Tallon, the Met’s chief digital officer. Making a pitch to young users, the site also features YouTube personality Ingrid Nilsen in short videos, in which she explains the evolution of the hoodie, the choker or colorful Japanese “Sukajan” jackets.

Terms of the deal remain undisclosed, but news of Alphabet’s intentions to sell Boston Dynamics first surfaced back in March 2016. That was roughly two years after Android co-founder Andy Rubin left Google, where he spearheaded a series of prominent robotics acquisitions, most prominently Boston Dynamics. That division, known internally as Replicant, was disbanded after Rubin’s departure, leaving the future of Boston Dynamics and the other robot companies in flux. Boston Dynamics was first put up for sale in March 2016 “We at Boston Dynamics are excited to be part of SoftBank’s bold vision and its position creating the next technology revolution, and we share SoftBank’s belief that advances in technology should be for the benefit of humanity,” said Marc Raibert, CEO and founder of Boston Dynamics, in a prepared statement. “We look forward to working with SoftBank in our mission to push the boundaries of what advanced robots can do and to create useful applications in a smarter and more connected world.” That Alphabet has finally sold its most high-profile robotics subsidiary may signal an end to the company’s passing flirtation with the world of humanoid and industrial robots. Boston Dynamics, a 25-year-old company originally spun out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has gained a worldwide reputation as a leader in robotics engineering for its development of bipedal and quadruped robots like Atlas and BigDog. Photo: Boston Dynamics The company has received funding from the US government’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and it pioneered techniques for helping robots maneuver real-world environments and adapt to complex changes in terrain. Its most recent development, shown off in a leaked video in February, is a jumping unit named Handle that combines both wheels and legs into a “nightmare-inducing robot” capable of advanced aerial maneuvers and obstacle avoidance. Alphabet’s Replicant robotics division didn’t last long after Andy Rubin’s departure Despite the steady march of Boston Dynamics’ robotics innovations, it appears Alphabet leadership didn’t quite know what it would ultimately do with the company. As part of an overall restructuring and cost-saving strategy set forth by Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat last year, the company has taken significant measures to slim down its experimental efforts and rein in its “moonshot” projects. Even prior to Porat’s hiring, it was clear Alphabet was at a bit of a loss with regard to its robotics ambitions. Astro Teller, the head of the company’s X lab, was the one who disbanded Replicant in 2014, before Google was restructured as Alphabet, according to Bloomberg. As part of the SoftBank deal, Alphabet is also selling Schaft, a humanoid robotics company Google acquired as part of its Replicant buying spree back in 2013 and 2014. Schaft was spun out of the JSK Robotics Laboratory within the University of Tokyo, making it a sensible purchase for SoftBank. Despite its huge presence in the Japanese telecom market, thanks to its 2006 acquisition of Vodafone Japan, SoftBank is also a leader in robotics — the company makes the popular humanoid Pepper robot in partnership with Aldebaran Robotics. “Today, there are many issues we still cannot solve by ourselves with human capabilities. Smart robotics are going to be a key driver of the next stage of the Information Revolution, and Marc and his team at Boston Dynamics are the clear technology leaders in advanced dynamic robots,” said SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son, in a statement. “I am thrilled to welcome them to the SoftBank family and look forward to supporting them as they continue to advance the field of robotics and explore applications that can help make life easier, safer, and more fulfilling.” Next Up In Tech Microsoft unveils a lot of big changes for Windows 10 Voliro’s concept hexacopter performs acrobatic stunts with ease Project Scorpio might be the Xbox's final form: a Windows PC Al Jazeera network hit with ‘continual hacking attempts’ AirPods will automatically pair with your Apple TV running tvOS 11 The BlackBerry KeyOne’s screen apparently isn’t glued to the rest of the phone Now Trending Microsoft unveils a lot of big changes for Windows 10 Project Scorpio might be the Xbox's final form: a Windows PC The future of Microsoft’s console may be a gaming PC.

But Google and Facebook are so much better at this that it’ll be tough for Verizon to do more than tread water. (Photo: Elise Amendola / AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE New York — About 2,100 jobs are on the chopping block as Verizon prepares to combine Yahoo and AOL for a digital advertising offensive. Yahoo’s shareholders on Thursday approved the $4.5 billion sale of its key businesses to Verizon. The deal is expected to close by Tuesday. AOL and Yahoo will cut 15 percent of the 14,000 workers they now employ, or about 2,100 jobs, said a person familiar with the matter who requested not to be identified discussing the cuts. Verizon has a simple goal in buying Yahoo’s core business: It wants to challenge Google and Facebook in the huge and lucrative field of digital advertising. But Verizon faces its own challenge in doing so, given that it will be competing against a slew of other companies also looking to break in. Verizon wants to become a strong third choice for advertisers by adding Yahoo’s popular sites and billion users worldwide to its own media business, which includes AOL and Verizon’s home-grown go90 video service. It can place ads on those sites, and can also combine data from visitors to those sites with AOL’s ad technologies and sales teams, and possibly also personal data from Verizon mobile customers such as location and other information, in order to better target ads at individuals. Verizon has programs that use mobile-customer data for targeted ads and may combine that with data gathered by AOL and Yahoo. Verizon says customers can choose whether to participate. Yahoo and AOL are “positioned to do better together than apart,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. But he is setting the bar low. While Verizon talks of growth from the deal, Wieser said “not declining would be a success. Five years from now, if the combined entity were the same size as it is today, I would consider that to be successful.” Verizon sees online ads — particularly targeted ads — as a potential new source of growth as the wireless industry fights for U.S. users with lower prices and other discounts. Verizon has “essentially turned into a no-growth business,” said CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino. The ad business would be a “big deal” for Verizon if it goes well, he said. Tim Armstrong, the former Google executive who joined AOL as CEO in 2009, has for years wanted to combine AOL with the long-declining Yahoo. Although AOL has big-name properties such as HuffPost and Engadget, it hasn’t been as big of an online destination as Yahoo’s mail, finance, sports and other properties. The combined business, to be called Oath, will expand its news, sports, entertainment, finance and lifestyle coverage. Like everyone else, Oath will focus on video and mobile, where consumers increasingly spend their time online. Armstrong says he wants Oath properties to be a place consumers “come and visit every day” and predicts users growing to 2 billion from 1.3 billion by 2020, with annual revenue of $10 billion to $20 billion from roughly $7 billion today. Lowell McAdam, CEO of New York-based Verizon, teased last month that this could set the stage for a new streaming video service, competing with the slew of internet-TV services already out there. Verizon already has a free mobile video service, go90, that isn’t well known. Facebook and Google together draw about half the world’s spending on digital ads, and in the U.S., they’re even more dominant. They’re also where the majority of mobile-ad dollars go, eMarketer data show. The sway Facebook and Google hold for advertisers isn’t expected to change in the next few years. They had a head start on mobile. Yahoo has poured billions into acquisitions that have helped Yahoo make some leeway in mobile — but not enough. It’s gotten better at doing mobile ads, but it has had no major hit apps. Still, AOL and Yahoo together provide a much-smaller No. 3 in the U.S. for advertisers looking to reach lots of people. But even if Verizon’s goal is to just be happy at No. 3, there are several much smaller players that also draw advertisers. Snapchat is a niche hit with young people. Amazon has an under-the-radar ad business that supports its e-commerce dominance. Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, is expected to grow its piece of the ad pie; Microsoft will be just behind the combined AOL-Yahoo in the U.S. once the deal closes. Twitter, although it’s sorting out its ad business, is a significant smaller player. Globally, several Chinese companies also rake in ad dollars. And the combined company will also have to compete for people’s attention, and not just with other services that rely on ad dollars to survive. Popular sites like Amazon or Netflix also suck up time spent online, said eMarketer analyst Martin Utreras. “They’ve acquired these two dinosaurs and you kind of wonder, can they be successful?” Zino said. That will depend on Verizon being able to convince marketers that they know more about consumers than anyone else, he said.

Release notes for Play Services v11 have been posted with a new API for smooth SMS verification and several significant additions and deprecations Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/06/08 3:32pm PDTJun 8, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 21 Share on Twitter Total Shares61 Development News Now that Google is through with its biggest developer conference of the year, it's time to deliver a few updates and fulfill some of the promises made during the event. Some of that is happening through and update to Play services. Google posted the release notes for the update and it includes a lot of additions, both big and small, and a few deprecations. For the non-developers in the crowd, most of this stuff isn't going to matter all that much, but there is one new feature that might catch their interest. A new API will allow apps to perform SMS verifications without accessing the SMS history. It's probably not a big change for users, and developers will still have to implement some changes to their app and server code before it can be used, but it means there will be fewer apps with an excuse to poke around in your SMS messages. There are quite a few changes to the different APIs provided by Play services, and developers should definitely check out the full list here. Here are a few particularly interesting things worth highlighting: SmsRetriever API is the SMS verification API mentioned above. It allows apps to listen for incoming SMS messages intended for them without asking users for permission to read all of their messages. This means phone number verifications can be entirely seamless with no authorization dialogs or manual steps to copy a code from a text message. It works by giving a unique hash to apps so they can pass it back to the developer's server. That hash should then be sent via SMS to the user's phone and parsed by Play services. Once a message with the hash is identified, it will be passed directly to the primary app. The RemoteMediaPlayer class has been deprecated from the Cast API. If you're using the Cast SDK v2, there is a guide available for migrating to Cast SDK v3. As we were told during I/O, all developers are now free to build Instant Apps. Details can be found here. Significant additions to Nearby and SafetyNet APIs, as well as some handy new classes for working with the Fused Location Provider and Awareness capabilities. If you haven't already done it, go to the SDK Manager in Android Studio or the one included with the Android SDK and update the Google repository to get started with the latest APIs.

That's why companies like Apple and Google have developed their own respective "languages" for enabling these devices to stay in sync. But some argue that this interconnectivity hasn't completely solved the smart home's biggest issues. In order to get those benefits, consumers must choose one specific platform, like Apple's HomeKit or Google's Works With Nest, which could limit the choices they have when shopping for smart home products. Get the latest deals, reviews and recommendations from the editors of TIME: sign up for The Goods newsletter here Andy Rubin, the creator of Android and CEO of newly launched tech company Essential, is trying to change that. One of his company's first products is a voice-enabled smart home assistant called, appropriately enough, Home. He hopes to make the gadget compatible with any smart home device, regardless of whether it runs on an Apple, Google, or Samsung-operated platform. The trick, says Rubin, is to use application programming interfaces, or APIs, to create a sort of emulator that allow his product to support gadgets on different platforms. An API is a set of protocols that makes it possible for apps and services to integrate with one another. They make it possible to use your Facebook credentials to sign up for a new website, for instance. Read more: The 25 Best Apps of the Year So Far Speaking on stage at the Wired Business Conference on June 7, Rubin compared the various smart home platforms to individual islands, saying his product would provide a bridge between them. "If I can emulate [these islands], I can turn it on and control 100,000 devices," Rubin told reporters. Following Rubin's May announcement of Essential, observers have questioned whether it will be possible to create a device that can offer cross functionality between competing platforms. Such doubts Apple doubly so to Apple, which is known for keeping its software and hardware ecosystems closed. The iPhone maker only allowed third-party developers to integrate their apps with Siri and iMessage last year, long after rivals like Amazon and Facebook made similar moves. But alongside the rise of smart home technology, tech giants have shown an increasing willingness to allow their devices and software to play nice with others. Google recently debuted its Google Assistant on the iPhone, while Microsoft's Cortana has been on iPhone and Android since 2015. Amazon in particular says it's willing to embrace even deeper collaboration, saying it's open to the idea of making Alexa compatible with Siri. "You should be able to tell Alexa, 'Ask Siri X,'" David Limp, Amazon's senior vice president of devices, told reporters at the conference. "If Apple or Google want to call, my number is out there." Read more: Here's What Amazon Thinks About Apple's New Echo Rival Even if Rubin's gadget succeeds at building those aforementioned bridges, there are plenty of other ways smart home tech could stand to improve. Rubin says he's already thinking about how the installation and setup process can become more accessible to those who aren't tech-savvy. Companies like Control4 offer remote device installation and management services, but Rubin feels customers should be able to handle their gear on their own. "That's an outdated approach," said Rubin. "The [people] that are doing the user interface are the same ones drilling holes in your wall . . . So I need to change who the installer is, and I think we've developed enough technology to make it very easy."

Millions have bought voice-activated speakers which play music, provide weather forecasts, order groceries and answer questions. The devices are brought to life by vocal commands such as 'Alexa' or 'Hello Google' but experts warn they pose a major security risk as they are always listening in and monitoring conversations. Criminals could hack into them to find out when families are away or steal credit card details when someone orders a takeaway over the phone. Cybersecurity expert Dr Jason Nurse warned: 'If hackers find a way to compromise these devices in our homes, they could have it recording all of the time and you wouldn't necessarily know. 'They could hear you discussing your holiday plans, so they know when you are away and could burgle you. 'They may hear you buying something on the phone, giving away your credit card details.'

Share this article Share The Oxford University research fellow, who was speaking at the Cheltenham Science Festival, is so concerned that he refuses to have electronic assistants in his house. However, the gadgets are more popular than ever. The Google Home, a similar device to the Amazon Echo, can pick up commands even in noisy rooms, track online shopping and even switch on lights and adjust the thermostat.But some fear that users are inviting an electronic spy into their home. HI-TECH HELPER  The Amazon Echo costs £149.99. It is a hands-free speaker with seven microphones, voice-controlled by a command to the virtual assistant Alexa. It plays music, provides sports scores and weather forecasts, can adjust lighting and heating, as well as answer questions and give traffic updates. The more you use it, the more it adapts to your speech patterns, vocabulary and preferences. Google Home, which went on sale in April and costs £129, works in a similar way. It is activated by the words 'OK Google' or 'hey Google'. Apple's version of the gadget, the HomePod, is late to the market after being announced this week. Available from December, it will cost about £270. Dr Nurse said: 'If there's something private you want to say, the first thing you should do is mute the device... or turn it off. You should think twice about what you say in front of these devices.' Conversations recorded on the Google Home device are automatically encrypted, while Amazon Echo has a 'microphone off' button and utterances can be deleted. Dr Nurse added: 'A TV, radio or someone else in your home may say the wake word without your knowledge and start it recording while you are discussing something private or sensitive. 'That may then be sent off without you being aware it is happening. 'Automation is great. It's fantastic that you can walk around your home and tell it to do things like you are talking to an individual but the risks are mounting. 'People should think about the cost-benefit pay-off in terms of privacy and security and how much convenience they add to your life.' An Amazon spokesman said: 'Amazon takes customer privacy seriously and we have taken measures to make Echo secure.' Google declined to comment.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 18 shares Most watched News videos Moment London Bridge attackers shot dead during frenzied stabbing Passengers laugh as drunk couple romp on a Ryanair flight Saudi Arabian team fail to line up for moment of silence Moment London Bridge terrorist on floor after being shot Mean passenger makes Ryanair employee cry at Brussels Airport London terrorists laugh & hug in secret meeting days before attack Dramatic moment gun shots were fired during London Bridge attack Road rage: Man leaps out of car to viciously attack driver Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn cast their general election votes Man almost killed by flying door after shooting fridge 'Two mums' swear in front of their children in transphobic tirade Dramatic moment police evacuate restaurant during London attack Was there no in-flight movie then?

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag.

Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses.

The cars, which use 360-degree cameras to photograph panoramic views for Google Maps, have been fitted with sensors that detect nitric oxide, nitric dioxide and black carbon. Google used them to map pollution levels in Oakland, California, with almost three million measurements captured over 14,000 road miles in the course of a year. The technology and publishing company, which worked with the US Environmental Defence Fund and scientists, used the data to create an interactive map. In findings published in Environmental Science & Technology it said that pollution at the worst intersections was five to eight times higher than… Want to read more?

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today released all the tools developers need to create applications and update apps for Android O. The company made the final Android O APIs available through an updated SDK. Developers can grab these tools through Android Studio 3.0. To coincide with the finalized APIs and SDK, Google updated the developer preview of Android O. The Android O Developer Preview 3 can be installed on the Nexus 6p and 5x, Pixel, Pixel XL, and Pixel C, and the Nexus Player. Google says the updated beta should be more stable for use as a developer platform, though it may not be ready for daily use. Some of the core features of Android O include picture-in-picture, notification dots, widget picker, new emoji, and revamped settings tools. The final version is expected to arrive later this summer. Google still has not revealed what dessert the "O" will be. more info at Google » Related Review: OtterBox Commuter for Google Pixel XL OtterBox's Commuter case for the Pixel XL is a rugged, rubber-and-plastic shell that provides plenty of protection for your pricey smartphone slab.

Bringing several changes to the UI and introducing the final API level coming to the official build later this summer, it’s a pretty significant update. Best of all, Developer Preview 3 finally confirms that yes, Android O will be version 8.0. We’ve already rounded up the new features in Developer Preview 3, but to summarize some of the changes made: API level 26 introduces the bug fixes and optimizations we can expect from the final build of Android 8.0, as well as allowing developers to release apps targeting Android O to the Google Play Store. The System UI tuner lost a few menus, leaving just cuztomizations for the status bar and Do Not Disturb mode. The Google Camera UI saw a few tweaks, adding video/photo switching buttons (though you can still switch modes by swiping across the screen as well), and refreshing the camera switcher icon. The WiFi and cellular icons, previously rearranged in Developer Preview 2 and met with unfavorable reactions, have been moved back to their original positions in the status bar. Persistent media notifications now match the prominent colors in album art and video thumbnails, and fade the image into the rest of the notification. To try Developer Preview for yourself, head to developer.android.com to download the factory image for your device, or sign up for the Android Beta Program to receive the preview as an over-the-air update.

Although some companies don’t actually tell customers when their devices will no longer receive updates, Google guarantees that its Pixel and Nexus devices will get feature updates for at least two years and security updates for three. Now, Google has updated its Android updates page to clarify how long they will cover both Nexus and Pixel devices with telephone and online support… UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases The gist of it is pretty simple. As Google states on its support page, Pixel/Nexus “phones get telephone or online support for at least as long as they get security updates. After that, we can’t guarantee continued support.” What this means is that as long as your Pixel or Nexus device is receiving security updates (three years from the date that the device went on sale in the Google Store), you will be able to either call or chat online with Google’s support team if you’re ever experiencing any issues. If you want to know how long your Pixel or Nexus will be covered, you can either head on over to Google’s support page or enlarge one of the photos below. Notably, the Pixel and Pixel XL will be covered through October 2019, and the Nexus 6P and 5X will be supported through September 2018.

Google Inc., which launched the Google Art Project in 2011 to link users with vast art collections around the world, has expanded its scope to include fashion. | Google via AP Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) — Anyone who has waited on a long, snaking line to get into a fashion exhibit at a top museum knows just how popular they’ve become — and more broadly, how fashion is increasingly seen as a form of artistic and cultural expression. Google Inc. is acknowledging this reality by expanding its Google Art Project — launched in 2011 to link users with art collections around the world, online — to include fashion. The new initiative, “We Wear Culture,” which launched Thursday, uses Google’s technology to connect fashion lovers to collections and exhibits at museums and other institutions, giving them the ability to not only view a garment, but to zoom in on the hem of a dress, examine a sleeve or a bit of embroidery on a gown up close, wander around an atelier, or sit down with Metropolitan Museum of Art costume restorers. This screen image released by Google shows a section of the new Google project, “We Wear Culture.” The new initiative, uses Google’s technology to connect users to fashion collections at museums and other institutions around the world, giving them the ability to not only view a garment, but to zoom in on the hem of a dress, wander around an atelier, or even sit down with Metropolitan Museum of Art costume restorers. | Google via AP The project partners with more 180 cultural institutions, including the Met’s Costume Institute, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, Japan’s Kyoto Costume Institute, and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. It comprises over 30,000 garments. The site also offers specially curated exhibits. You can click your way to, for example, a curated photo exhibit on Tokyo Street Style, or an exploration of women’s gowns in the 18th century. You can search by designer, or by their muse — examining, say, Marilyn Monroe’s love of Ferragamo stiletto heels, via the Museo Salvatore Ferragamo in Florence, Italy. At a preview demonstration this week, Amit Sood, director of the Google Cultural Institute and designer of the Google Art Project (now called Google Arts & Culture) explained that he wasn’t initially clued into the possibilities for fashion, because at the tech giant, “we all wear hoodies.” But, he said, collaborating with an institution like the Met showed him that “art and fashion have a long history together.” The idea behind the new project, he said, is to tell the story — or rather, the multiple stories — behind fashion. There are several virtual reality films included in the project. A 360-degree video displays the Met’s conservation studio, with conservators explaining how they keep delicate clothing strong enough for display — one of them explaining, for example, how the team uses needles designed for eye surgeons. It is the ultimate fragility of clothes, though, that makes the project appealing to museum curators, explained Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute’s head curator — whereas many garments are too delicate to be permanently displayed, digitizing a collection makes it viewable forever. The Costume Institute has provided 500 of the objects on display, noted Loic Tallon, the Met’s chief digital officer. Making a pitch to young users, the site also features YouTube personality Ingrid Nilsen in short videos, in which she explains the evolution of the hoodie, the choker, or colorful Japanese “Sukajan” jackets.

By TALI ARBEAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — About 2,100 jobs are on the chopping block as Verizon prepares to combine Yahoo and AOL for a digital advertising offensive. Yahoo’s shareholders Thursday approved the $4.5 billion sale of its key businesses to Verizon. The deal is expected to close by Tuesday. AOL and Yahoo will cut 15 percent of the 14,000 workers they now employ, or about 2,100 jobs, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing the cuts. Photo shows Yahoo and Verizon Wireless logos on a laptop in North Andover, Mass. Verizon is buying Yahoo in hopes of challenging Google and Facebook in the digital advertising market by combining ad technologies and user profiles. Associated Press/Elise Amendola Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → USING YAHOO Verizon has a simple goal in buying Yahoo’s core business: It wants to challenge Google and Facebook in the huge and lucrative field of digital advertising. But Verizon faces its own challenge, given that it will be competing against a slew of other companies also looking to break in. Verizon wants to become a strong third choice for advertisers by adding Yahoo’s popular sites and billion users worldwide to its own media business, which includes AOL and Verizon’s home-grown go90 video service. It can place ads on those sites, and can also combine data from visitors to those sites with AOL’s ad technologies and sales teams, and possibly also personal data from Verizon mobile customers such as location and other information, in order to better target ads at individuals. Verizon has programs that use mobile-customer data for targeted ads and may combine that with data gathered by AOL and Yahoo. Verizon says customers can choose whether to participate. Yahoo and AOL are “positioned to do better together than apart,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. But he is setting the bar low. While Verizon talks of growth from the deal, Wieser said “not declining would be a success. Five years from now, if the combined entity were the same size as it is today, I would consider that to be successful.” THE VISION Verizon sees online ads – particularly targeted ads – as a potential new source of growth as the wireless industry fights for U.S. users with lower prices and other discounts. Verizon has “essentially turned into a no-growth business,” said CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino. The ad business would be a “big deal” for Verizon if it goes well, he said. Tim Armstrong, the former Google executive who joined AOL as CEO in 2009, has for years wanted to combine AOL with the long-declining Yahoo. Although AOL has big-name properties such as HuffPost and Engadget, it hasn’t been as big of an online destination as Yahoo’s mail, finance, sports and other properties. The combined business, to be called Oath, will expand its news, sports, entertainment, finance and lifestyle coverage. Like everyone else, Oath will focus on video and mobile, where consumers increasingly spend their time online. Armstrong says he wants Oath properties to be a place consumers “come and visit every day” and predicts users growing to 2 billion from 1.3 billion by 2020, with annual revenue of $10 billion to $20 billion from roughly $7 billion today. Lowell McAdam, CEO of New York-based Verizon, teased last month that this could set the stage for a new streaming video service, competing with the internet-TV services already out there. Verizon already has a free mobile video service, go90, that isn’t well known. ALTERNATIVES TO THE DUOPOLY Facebook and Google together draw about half the world’s spending on digital ads, and in the U.S., they’re even more dominant. They’re also where the majority of mobile-ad dollars go, eMarketer data show. The sway Facebook and Google hold for advertisers isn’t expected to change in the next few years. They had a head start on mobile. Yahoo has poured billions into acquisitions that have helped Yahoo make some leeway in mobile – but not enough. It’s gotten better at doing mobile ads, but it has had no major hit apps. Still, AOL and Yahoo together provide a much-smaller No. 3 in the U.S. for advertisers looking to reach lots of people. But even if Verizon’s goal is to just be happy at No. 3, there are several much smaller players that also draw advertisers. Snapchat is a niche hit with young people. Amazon has an under-the-radar ad business that supports its e-commerce dominance. Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, is expected to grow its piece of the ad pie; Microsoft will be just behind the combined AOL-Yahoo in the U.S. once the deal closes. Twitter is a significant smaller player. Share Read or Post Comments Send questions/comments to the editors. Want the news vital to Maine? Our daily headlines email is delivered each morning.

MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH Policy Facebook, Google, ACLU Voice Concerns About Republican Internet Privacy Bill NetChoice, a trade group that includes targeted ad giants Google, Facebook and Yahoo, says the bill will end free services online. by Giuseppe Macri, InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C. / June 8, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) --  More opponents are lining up against congressional Republicans’ online privacy bill, including a trade group representing Facebook and Google — whose user data collection would be limited by the legislation — and the ACLU, which says it will limit states’ ability to pass their own restrictions. NetChoice, a trade group that includes targeted ad giants Google, Facebook, and Yahoo, says a bill proposed by Republican Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn to make web services and internet access providers like Comcast and Verizon get permission from users before collecting their data will end free services online. “[I]magine a world where the next time you use a search engine, instead of seeing results, you see a requirement to enter a credit card. Or the next time you visit USA Today there is fewer content and even more ads on the screen,” NetChoice senior policy counsel Carl Szabo wrote in a blog post this week. RELATEDSilicon Valley's Next Concern? Net NeutralityHow to Defend Net Neutrality: Make Your Voice Heard “In this alternate world,” he continued, “you are bombarded with pop-ups and interstitials, all of which are asking for consent in various ways: blanket consent for use of all ‘sensitive’ information, consent for use of some sensitive information, consent for use of sensitive and non-sensitive information, and so on.” Szabo warns that will be the fate of the web if Congress advances the BROWSER Act. Under the law, companies on both sides of the online ecosystem would have to obtain opt-in consent from users before collecting and monetizing their sensitive data, a reversal of the current, largely opt-out requirement set down by the Federal Trade Commission. The definition of “sensitive” includes web browsing history, a category previously left unregulated before the FCC passed privacy rules aimed exclusively at internet service providers (ISPs) last year. According to NetChoice, the bill would erase $340 billion in advertising revenue over the next five years, citing studies that show opt-in regimes are 65 percent less effective. The loss of targeted ads will mean a greater volume of ads, less content, and more paywalls across popular websites, consequences that will hit low-income Americans and small businesses hardest. The group argues the FTC already enforces privacy standards and that the industry regulates itself. But the FTC rules only require opt-in consent for the most sensitive information, like health and financial data. Meanwhile, efforts by edge providers themselves, like Google Chrome’s “Do Not Track” feature, are largely ignored by other websites. There’s no law requiring they comply with the browser’s request. Blackburn, who chairs a committee overseeing the FCC, sponsored the House repeal of the agency’s privacy rules. She and other Republicans said the FCC rules “focused on only one part of the internet ecosystem and ignored edge provider services that collect as much, if not more data, than ISPs.” Many of the Republicans who voted for the repeal count ISPs among some of their largest donors, and became the target of a groundswell of constituent criticism. Blackburn’s bill invited another wave of criticism, including from consumer advocate groups who say the legislation is at best a disingenuous attempt at saving political face with little chance of passing, and at worst cover for preventing states from passing their own privacy standards. “[O]ur skepticism comes from a provision buried at very end of the bill that would explicitly preempt state legislation on these issues — even if a state passes legislation requiring higher privacy standards than Congress,” ACLU legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani wrote of the bill. “The provision appears to be a naked attempt to undercut state privacy efforts.” Some 17 states are working on online privacy legislation in the wake of the repeal of the FCC privacy rules. Those efforts would likely prove problematic for internet service and edge providers, who would have to adhere to different privacy standards across multiple states. States like New Hampshire are considering rules tougher than those passed by the FCC, including barring ISPs from offering discounts to subscribers choosing to waive privacy protections. Other states are considering a ban on collection altogether. “Rep. Blackburn’s bill would do precisely what industry wants, which is prevent states from taking their own actions to ensure high privacy standards,” the ACLU attorney wrote. The pro-net neutrality group Public Knowledge has yet to stake out a position on the bill. Other groups that track privacy issues including Fight for the Future, TechFreedom, and the Association of National Advertisers oppose the bill. ©2017 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

AUTOMATION DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNET TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVES INSIGHTS GOVTECH.COM FutureStructure_Grey Automation Washington Governor Signs Order for Public Autonomous Vehicle Testing Gov. Jay Inslee’s move is similar to the order signed in Arizona in 2015, which also established pilot programs with loose regulations for companies to test self-driving vehicles. By David Gutman, The Seattle Times / June 8, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) -- Self-driving cars, with or without a human behind the wheel, could begin testing on Washington roads in 60 days, under an executive order signed by Gov. Jay Inslee Wednesday. Inslee’s order, signed in front of representatives of industry behemoths like General Motors, Google and Uber, allows companies to apply with the state Department of Licensing for permission, under pilot programs, to test-drive autonomous vehicles on state roads. The governor wrote that autonomous vehicles could produce “transformational societal benefits” and touted his action as a way to bring more companies in a growing industry to the state and to promote safer car travel. He also talked about the vehicles’ potential, if combined with electric technology, to reduce carbon emissions. RELATEDOlympia, Wash., Cracks Down on Distracted DrivingPeople Are Apprehensive About Self-Driving Cars, Survey SaysSelf-Driving Ubers Return to Pittsburgh   He spoke of having a “relatively light touch” with regulations on the industry. The executive order spells out few specific requirements, other than vehicles must be capable of stopping safely in the event of a system failure. The order also creates a work group, made up of officials from various state agencies, to propose, based on results of pilot programs, changes to rules or laws concerning autonomous vehicles. Inslee said that 94 percent of accidents are caused by human error, a number that autonomous-vehicle technology has the potential to cut drastically. The event took place at the headquarters of Echodyne, a Bellevue company that makes high-resolution radar that could be used in driverless cars. It’s one of more than a dozen companies in the state working on aspects of the autonomous-vehicle industry. “One thing I know about radar, it doesn’t drive drunk, it doesn’t drive distracted,” Inslee said. “We humans are really good at a lot of things, driving cars isn’t necessarily one of them compared to the automated processes that are digital and foolproof. I just have huge confidence in the safety aspects of this.” Bryan Roosa, director of North American government relations for General Motors, said the framework Inslee laid out was similar to the limited regulations in five other states — Michigan, Colorado, Texas, Tennessee and Georgia. “Current state law doesn’t account for a car without a human behind the wheel,” Roosa said. “We’re looking for certainty. A pathway to test and deploy.” Autonomous vehicles are already on the road in cities and states across the country, albeit almost always with a driver behind the wheel. Google began testing self-driving cars, in small numbers, in Kirkland last year. Inslee’s move is similar to one signed in Arizona in 2015, which also established pilot programs with loose regulations for companies to test self-driving vehicles and set up a committee to evaluate the outcomes. Both Uber and Waymo, Google’s self-driving car company, are testing their vehicles in Arizona, although both companies still use a driver who can take control of the vehicle when necessary.   In January, the federal government designated 10 testing sites for self-driving cars, including the city of Pittsburgh, where Uber is also testing cars. None of the sites is in Washington. “From now through 2025 you’re going to see a lot of this commercial use — automated taxis, automated ride sharing in individual cities,” said Scott Frank, a vice president of Airbiquity, a Seattle-based connected-car company. “Private ownership — going to the Ford dealer — we think that’s going to be 2030 and beyond because you have to get through this phase of understanding the technologies.” Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, recently predicted that his company is about two years away from a fully autonomous vehicle — meaning no driver input would be necessary. Once deployed on a broad scale, the vehicles carry the potential to profoundly alter roadways, with possibilities that they could either ease traffic congestion or increase gridlock. Autonomous vehicles could travel more efficiently and closer together, allowing roads to flow more smoothly. But they could also lead to more cars on the road. Picture your autonomous vehicle driving you to work, dropping you off and then returning home to park, before coming back to pick you up. You’ve made your commute and parking easier, but you’ve also turned two trips into four. Avery Ash, an autonomous-vehicle strategist for INRIX, a Kirkland automobile-data and technology company, said widespread autonomous vehicles are unlikely in the next 10 years. ©2017 The Seattle Times Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

The details can be found in the About Phone settings section of a device that is running the Android O developer preview 3. Though the system’s version number has been confirmed, its nickname remains a secret. The most obvious tasty treat name for Android O would be Oreo; however, several pundits are skeptical, considering Google teased I/O attendees by offering Oreos as snacks during the technology festival in May. Read: Android O Release Date Expected In August Ahead Of Pixel Smartphones Updates Often Google making hints at an Android system name rules said the name out as an option. But there are few alternative names for this software version unless Google is okay calling Android 8.0 Orange (we suppose tasty treats can be healthy) or Oatmeal Cookie (which sounds a lot more like an internal codename used strictly by Google developers). If Android 8.0 is in fact Oreo, it could indicate a collaboration between Google and Nabisco, similar to how the tech giant struck a cross promotion deal with Nestle in 2013 to name Android 4.4 KitKat. But the public will have to wait at least until August to learn the official name of Android 8.0. The software would be made available to Google devices Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P smartphones, the Pixel C notebook and the Nexus Player before coming to the rumored second generation Pixel smartphones, likely sometime in October. Read: Android O Release Date Details: One Plus 3 Confirmed For Update Several OEM smartphones are already confirmed for Android 8.0 updates, including OnePlus 3 and 3T and the Nokia 6. Currently, users will be able to install the OTA (over the air) images of Android O to their devices. Several new system features include faster roll outs, battery improvements, faster boot times, updated emoji, smart text selection, picture-in-pictures, updates to the home screen and the night light feature, and a new initiative called Android Go, which brings features of the new system to low-end Android devices.

With Google, their devices use Google Assistant, and Apple’s recently launched HomePod is powered by Siri. This makes sense as all these technologies are proprietary to the company that made them. However it seems that Amazon isn’t opposed to the idea that maybe one device could house more than one AI software. Speaking to CNET, Amazon’s senior vice president of devices David Limp stated that the company is open to the idea that maybe other software such as Siri or Google Assistant could be installed in the Echo. Limp was quoted as saying, “We’re open to that. If Apple or Google want to come call, my phone number is out there. They can call. I hope there is a day when that happens. I don’t know if I can envision it, but I hope it happens, on behalf of customers.” Given how in the past Apple has been accused of having a walled garden strategy, it’s hard to imagine that they would want to encourage customers to buy another company’s product to access its services. Google might be a different story, although there is no indication that the company plans on collaborating with Amazon anytime soon. It’s an interesting approach but what do you guys think?

The new initiative, uses Google's technology to connect users to fashion collections at museums and other institutions around the world, giving them the ability to not only view a garment, but to zoom in on the hem of a dress, wander around an atelier, or even sit down with Metropolitan Museum of Art costume restorers. (Google via AP) Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint NEW YORK — Anyone who has waited on a long, snaking line to get into a fashion exhibit at a top museum knows just how popular they've become — and more broadly, how fashion is increasingly seen as a form of artistic and cultural expression. Google Inc. is acknowledging this reality by expanding its Google Art Project — launched in 2011 to link users with art collections around the world, online — to include fashion. The new initiative , "We Wear Culture," which launched Thursday, uses Google's technology to connect fashion lovers to collections and exhibits at museums and other institutions, giving them the ability to not only view a garment, but to zoom in on the hem of a dress, examine a sleeve or a bit of embroidery on a gown up close, wander around an atelier, or sit down with Metropolitan Museum of Art costume restorers. The project partners with more 180 cultural institutions, including the Met's Costume Institute, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, Japan's Kyoto Costume Institute, and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. It comprises over 30,000 garments. The site also offers specially curated exhibits. You can click your way to, for example, a curated photo exhibit on Tokyo Street Style, or an exploration of women's gowns in the 18th century. You can search by designer, or by their muse — examining, say, Marilyn Monroe's love of Ferragamo stiletto heels, via the Museo Salvatore Ferragamo in Florence, Italy. At a preview demonstration this week, Amit Sood, director of the Google Cultural Institute and designer of the Google Art Project (now called Google Arts & Culture) explained that he wasn't initially clued into the possibilities for fashion, because at the tech giant, "we all wear hoodies." But, he said, collaborating with an institution like the Met showed him that "art and fashion have a long history together." The idea behind the new project, he said, is to tell the story — or rather, the multiple stories — behind fashion. There are several virtual reality films included in the project. A 360-degree video displays the Met's conservation studio, with conservators explaining how they keep delicate clothing strong enough for display — one of them explaining, for example, how the team uses needles designed for eye surgeons. It is the ultimate fragility of clothes, though, that makes the project appealing to museum curators, explained Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute's head curator — whereas many garments are too delicate to be permanently displayed, digitizing a collection makes it viewable forever. The Costume Institute has provided 500 of the objects on display, noted Loic Tallon, the Met's chief digital officer. Making a pitch to young users, the site also features YouTube personality Ingrid Nilsen in short videos, in which she explains the evolution of the hoodie, the choker, or colorful Japanese "Sukajan" jackets.

(Google via AP) The new initiative , "We Wear Culture," which launched Thursday, uses Google's technology to connect fashion lovers to collections and exhibits at museums and other institutions, giving them the ability to not only view a garment, but to zoom in on the hem of a dress, examine a sleeve or a bit of embroidery on a gown up close, wander around an atelier, or sit down with Metropolitan Museum of Art costume restorers. The project partners with more 180 cultural institutions, including the Met's Costume Institute, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, Japan's Kyoto Costume Institute, and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. It comprises over 30,000 garments. The site also offers specially curated exhibits. You can click your way to, for example, a curated photo exhibit on Tokyo Street Style, or an exploration of women's gowns in the 18th century. You can search by designer, or by their muse — examining, say, Marilyn Monroe's love of Ferragamo stiletto heels, via the Museo Salvatore Ferragamo in Florence, Italy. At a preview demonstration this week, Amit Sood, director of the Google Cultural Institute and designer of the Google Art Project (now called Google Arts & Culture) explained that he wasn't initially clued into the possibilities for fashion, because at the tech giant, "we all wear hoodies." But, he said, collaborating with an institution like the Met showed him that "art and fashion have a long history together." The idea behind the new project, he said, is to tell the story — or rather, the multiple stories — behind fashion. There are several virtual reality films included in the project. A 360-degree video displays the Met's conservation studio, with conservators explaining how they keep delicate clothing strong enough for display — one of them explaining, for example, how the team uses needles designed for eye surgeons. It is the ultimate fragility of clothes, though, that makes the project appealing to museum curators, explained Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute's head curator — whereas many garments are too delicate to be permanently displayed, digitizing a collection makes it viewable forever. The Costume Institute has provided 500 of the objects on display, noted Loic Tallon, the Met's chief digital officer. Making a pitch to young users, the site also features YouTube personality Ingrid Nilsen in short videos, in which she explains the evolution of the hoodie, the choker, or colorful Japanese "Sukajan" jackets. ___ Online: https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/project/fashion Advertisement Advertise With Us Report Error Submit a Tip RefundRefund You can comment on most stories on winnipegfreepress.com.

The Digital Journalism Innovation Award was announced on Saturday during the 6th National Congress of Digital Journalism, organized by the journalism forum, known as FOPEA, and Google. La Nacion Data Argentina analyzed 40,000 audio recordings that included information on which Jewish special prosecutor Alberto Nisman based his allegation that the government of former President Cristina de Kirchner cooperated with Iran to cover up the Islamic Republic’s role in the bombing. The group also developed a database that makes it possible to search the recordings by topic or person. Nisman was found dead in 2015 just hours before he was to present his findings to Argentinean lawmakers. Google Argentina recognized “the exploration and testing of different technologies to achieve the journalistic objective, one of which was the voice recognition to achieve an accurate transcription of the audios. The technology was unable to fulfill this task satisfactorily and this marks a way for Google and other industry companies to continue working on developing more and better tools.” The analysis, which was conducted by 120 volunteers, uncovered several pieces of information that had not been previously disclosed. Among them: * Iran’s local community paid bail to help a local activist accused of being a member of the violent movement Quebracho; * A national senator from an official government party was discovered to be an active lobbyist for the Iranian government in partnership with local businessmen; * Iran financed a local activist movement in favor of the Kirchner government that led demonstrations and protests against the U.S. Embassy. Nisman was found dead on Jan. 18, 2015, hours before he was to present his allegations concerning the AMIA bombing, which killed 85 people and injured 300. His allegations named then-President de Kirchner, former Foreign Minister Hector Timerman and other government officials as co-conspirators in a cover-up. Whether Nisman’s shooting in his apartment was murder or self-inflicted has yet to be determined. The La Nacion data investigation is also shortlisted for the global Data Journalism Awards. Jewish-Christian fellowship group increases aid to Arab Israelis during Ramadan JERUSALEM (JTA)—The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews is increasing food and clothing assistance to Arab Israelis during the Muslim holiday season of Ramadan. The fellowship currently is distributing 9,500 food and clothing vouchers during Ramadan, which began on May 26, through Israeli social services offices in 78 Arab and Arab-Jewish communities. More than 9,000 low-income families will receive the assistance. The fellowship also will distribute 5,500 food vouchers and 4,000 clothing vouchers to children in after-school clubs run by Israel’s Ministry of Social Services and Social Affairs. The Ramadan aid is part of an overall $5.6 million that the fellowship is providing to needy Israeli Arabs in 2017, the group said. The fellowship’s founder and president, Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, has called on the government of Israel to bolster Israeli Arabs’ connection to the country in the wake of a proposed law to officially declare Israel a Jewish state, which has stirred anxiety among Israeli Arabs and other minorities. “It is important that the citizens of Israel understand that the legislation of the law declaring Israel as the nation of the Jewish people may be important, but the feeling of equality and quality of life among the Arab citizens of Israel, one-fifth of Israel’s citizens, is the real guarantee of the whole Israeli society and the future of a moral and sustainable nation,” Eckstein said in a statement. The fellowship also recently invested in projects to improve medical services in Bedouin communities, and has provided educational scholarships for many hundreds of Christian and Muslim Arab and Druze Israelis. Jewish nurse breastfeeds baby of injured Palestinian mother during hospital shift JERUSALEM (JTA)—A Palestinian baby seriously injured in a car accident was breastfed by a Jewish nurse when he refused to take a bottle. Nurse Ula Ostrowski-Zak nursed the nine-month-old boy throughout her shift at Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital on Friday night, the Ynet news website reported. The baby’s family had been in a head-on collision with a bus on Route 60 in the West Bank, killing the baby’s father and leaving his mother with a serious head injury. The baby was slightly injured and cried for seven hours in the emergency room while continuing to refuse a bottle, according to the report. The baby’s aunts asked Ostrowski-Zak to help them find someone to nurse the boy and the nurse reportedly volunteered to do it herself. She nursed the baby five times during the next day. She then posted a request for help with nursing the baby on an Israeli Facebook page for nursing mothers and received many responses from women willing to come to the hospital, from as far away as Haifa, to help feed the baby until he is discharged. The baby’s mother remains in serious condition. Converging interests of Israel, Arab states is ‘opportunity,’ McMaster tells AJC (JTA)—H.R. McMaster, the U.S. National Security Advisor, called the converging interests of Israel and other Middle Eastern countries an “opportunity,” during an address to the American Jewish Committee’s Global Forum in Washington. In a speech Sunday night, McMaster noted a “reassessment of regional relationships, most notably between Israel and a number of our Arab partners—all friends of America, but too often adversaries of each other. Today their interests are converging. This is an opportunity.” Citing the 1967 Six Day War as an example, McMaster said that what can appear to be an unprecedented challenge can present opportunities. Today, in the face of threats from Hamas, Hezbollah, the Islamic State and Iran, Israel “has adapted and performed amazingly well” because it “consistently recognized and acted on opportunities when others may have seen only difficulties,” he said. McMaster praised Trump’s recent visit to the Middle East, noting that aimed to reaffirm American leadership in the world, build relationships with regional leaders and “promote a message of unity among the followers of three of the world’s great faiths.” McMaster said that Trump convinced more than 50 leaders of Muslim countries he met with in Saudi Arabia to agree “to cut off the financing for extremists and prevent them from hijacking and perverting their religion,” a pledge he said the administration intended to monitor. McMaster added that while in Israel, Trump “reaffirmed America’s rock-solid alliance with our closest military ally,” and emphasized to the Palestinian Authority leadership the need to counter terrorism. The AJC Global Forum runs through June 6 in Washington, D.C., with more than 2,500 participants from across the United States and 70 countries around the world. American UN Ambassador Nikki Haley to visit Israel on Wednesday JERUSALEM (JTA)—U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley will visit Israel, including the Old City of Jerusalem and the Western Wall. Haley will arrive in Israel on Wednesday, according to Israeli news reports. She is scheduled to meet with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as senior Palestinian officials, the Times of Israel reported. Haley is scheduled to fly over the country’s northern and southern borders in a helicopter, visit Tel Aviv and lay a wreath at Yad Vashem, accompanied by Israel’s UN Ambassador Danny Danon. Her visit to the Old City of Jerusalem and the Western Wall are being billed as “private and religious,” however, and she will not be accompanied by Israeli officials. President Trump, in his recent visit to holy sites in Jerusalem, was also unaccompanied by Israeli political leaders. In an interview in May with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Haley said that the Western Wall belongs to Israel and that Israel’s capital is Jerusalem. “I don’t know what the policy of the administration is, but I believe the Western Wall is part of Israel and I think that that is how we’ve always seen it and that’s how we should pursue it,” Haley said “We’ve always thought the Western Wall was part of Israel” The comments came in the wake of reports that a Trump administration official, responding to a request that Israeli officials accompany the president when he visited the Western Wall, replied that the Western Wall “is not your territory, it’s part of the West Bank.” In the interview, Haley also reiterated her support for moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. “Obviously I believe that the capital should be Jerusalem and the embassy should be moved to Jerusalem because if you look at all their government is in Jerusalem,” she said. “So much of what goes on is in Jerusalem, and I think we have to see that for what it is.” As a candidate, Trump promised to move the embassy. But last week, Trump signed an order renewing the six-month waiver that allows the U.S. embassy to remain in Tel Aviv. An act of Congress in 1995 required relocating the embassy to Jerusalem, but successive administrations have delayed the change with a series of six-month waivers, citing national security concerns. Democratic lawmakers want US to pressure Israel over its treatment of Palestinian activist (JTA)—Four Democratic lawmakers are circulating a letter calling for the United States to urge Israel to reconsider charges against a prominent Palestinian activist. The letter —which is being circulated this week by Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, who serves as deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, as well as Reps. Marc Pocan, D-Wis., Betty McCollum, D-Minn., and Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore.—urges Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to pressure Israel to drop charges against Issa Amro. Amro, who advocates non-violent resistance against Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and co-founded the group Youth Against Settlements, was indicted last year by an Israeli military court on a number of charges, including entering closed military zones and obstructing soldiers, according to Haaretz. The congressional letter cites criticism of the indictment by Amnesty International, which called the charges “baseless,” and the United Nations’ Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. “As the United States seeks to assist in brokering a peace agreement between both sides, we should encourage our steadfast ally in the region to uphold our shared values and respect activists like Issa Amro: freedom of expression must be a foundation for a just and lasting peace for the Israeli and Palestinian people,” reads the letter, posted online by the Foundation for Middle East Peace. Eugene Kontorovich, a law professor at Northwestern University who opposes boycotts of Israel and the settlements, criticized the letter. “The letter takes as holy writ the statements of the U.N. Human Rights Council, whose obsessive, biased and untruthful campaign against Israel is well known, and has recently been denounced by America’s ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley,” Kontorovich told Jewish Insider. Sen. Al Franken cancels upcoming appearance on ‘Real Time with Bill Maher’ (JTA)—Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., cancelled his upcoming appearance on HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher” to protest the host’s recent on-air use of a racial slur. The cancellation was first reported on Monday by the Huffington Post. In an interview Friday with Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., the lawmaker invited Maher to join in for “work in the fields.” Maher demurred, saying that he was a “house n****r.” Maher later apologized for the remark. HBO said it would not fire Maher over the comment “Senator Franken believes that what Bill Maher said was inappropriate and offensive, which is why he made the decision not to appear on the next episode of ‘Real Time,’” Franken’s spokesperson said in statement emailed to Huffington Post. “He was glad to see Bill, who the Senator considers to be a good friend, apologize and express sincere regret for his comment.” No other guests scheduled for the next show have announced that they would pull out. Symone Sanders, an activist and former national press secretary for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, confirmed to the Huffington Post that she would appear. Other scheduled guests include Ice Cube, Former Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.) and journalist David Gregory. Ship named for Gabby Giffords to be commissioned next week (JTA)—A United States Navy warship named for Gabby Giffords will be put to sea next week. The ship will be officially named Gabrielle Giffords in honor of the Arizona Democratic congresswoman who survived a 2011 gunshot wound to the head. It will be the first Navy ship named after a living woman in 160 years. The ceremony, which will take place in Galveston, Texas, will feature Hillary Clinton and former Vice President Joe Biden. The vessel is a 418-foot combat ship bearing machine guns and missiles, according to the New York Times. Below the mast, a box will hold an American flag patch that Giffords’ husband Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut, wore on his spacesuit; a purple heart left at the hospital where Giffords was treated for the gunshot wound; her congressional identification; and a 19th-century coin. Six people died and 12 were injured in the January 2011 assassination attempt, in which Giffords was shot in the head at close range. She recovered from the attack and resigned her seat a year later. She learned that the ship would be named for her on the day she resigned. In the years since, she and Kelly have become gun safety advocates. “That our Navy chose to give my name to this ship is an incredibly humbling honor—one I would never have imagined, one I will never forget, and one for which I always remain grateful,” Giffords said, according to the Times. “When we celebrate the commissioning this weekend, I will be thinking of the thousands of hardworking Americans who built this ship and the brave men and women who will serve aboard her.” Pro-Israel event in London postponed over security fears (JTA)—A pro-Israel event in London has been postponed due to security concerns in the wake of terror attacks in London and Manchester. The Christians United For Israel’s annual “A Night To Honour Israel,” scheduled for June 22, in Westminster, London, was expected to draw more than 1,000 people. It was postponed on Monday and a new date was not announced. The organization said in a statement posted on its website that it had already planned to increase security to “a much higher level than usual,” following recent terrorist attacks in London and Manchester. “However, having assessed the current situation and received independent advice we have taken the difficult decision to postpone the event. Islamic extremists have called for the specific targeting of Christians and Jews during the month of Ramadan, during which our event was set to take place. Although no specific threat has been received, we have been advised that our event could be a target,” the CUFI statement said. The John Hagee Ministries Conference that was expected to take place after the event also was postponed. The CUFI statement added: “We are determined that the impact of Islamic extremism will not win. We are resolved to confront it through our work and over the next few weeks you will see more activity from CUFI in addressing some of these challenges. The roots of the threat currently facing this nation is the same that Israel has faced for years. Our standing with Israel against radical Islam is crucial at this time, as is standing with our country as it comes to terms with its impact. A car ramming and stabbing attack on London Bridge and in the nearby Borough Market on Saturday night left seven people dead and dozens injured. The Islamic State late on Sunday claimed responsibility. In March, a car ramming and knife attack in Westminster left five people dead, and two weeks ago a bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester killed 22 people. Jewish middle school student suspended for alleged anti-Semitic incident (JTA)—An eighth grade student was suspended from a Colorado middle school for an alleged anti-Semitic incident, even though both the student and the victim are Jewish. A student at Oberon Middle School in Jefferson County, Colorado, tied another student to a soccer goal post and told him to “burn, Jew, burn.” The school district learned about the incident through an anonymous school survey that asked students about their experiences during the past school year. After investigating the incident, the district suspended the student they believed to be responsible, according to the CBS Denver affiliate CBS 4. “You don’t use ethnic slurs, racism isn’t okay in our schools. Any time this happens we are going to take action,” Jefferson County Public Schools spokesperson Diana Wilson told CBS 4. The channel reported that it had discovered that the boys were friends and both Jewish. The suspension comes after several allegations of anti-Semitism at the same middle school. One student told the district school board that she has to “constantly deal with anti-Semitism.” She also complained in a public forum about the incidents to Democratic Rep. Jared Polis, according to the report. A student also complained that fellow students drew a swastika on his arm, and a teacher has complained about anti-Semitic incidents. At another district middle school, students were suspended after making anti-Semitic remarks and drawings.

Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg/Getty Images Editor's Note: This story was originally published on May 9, 2017. It has been updated to reflect developments including Uber's firing of 20 employees following an internal investigation into its corporate culture, as well as self-driving engineer Anthony Levandowski. If you haven’t heard (maybe you’ve been toiling in Elon’s tunnels?), Uber has had a rough start to 2017. The Department of Justice has launched a criminal probe into the company’s use of “Greyball,” a system it used to identify regulatory officials and block them from booking rides. In January, it lost riders who objected to CEO Travis Kalanick’s (soon abandoned) seat on President Trump’s economic council. In late February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published an explosive blog post, accusing Uber of fostering a misogynistic corporate culture. A few days later, Google autonomous driving spinoff Waymo filed a lawsuit alleging Uber boosted its self-driving program by stealing Waymo's trade secrets. And this week, Uber canned at least 20 employees following an internal probe into the harassment probe—with the results of an external probe to come next week. A half dozen high-level executives have left since February. Meanwhile, financial records show the company burning cash at eye-popping rates, while profitability remains elusive. In a mess like this, it’s hard to know which problems everyone might soon forget and which could hurt the company's fortunes. To guide you, we’ve rounded up the latest fires, ranked by the likelihood they’ll be the one to scorch the house Travis built. 1. Waymo Attacks On February 23, Waymo, Google’s self-driving car spinoff, filed a lawsuit against Uber. It alleged former employee Anthony Levandowski illicitly downloaded 14,000 technical documents, including the blueprints for its lidar sensor, technology considered essential for a fully autonomous vehicle. Waymo says Levandowski, who resigned in January 2016, used that info to cofound Otto, an autonomous-truck outfit, that same month. Uber then acquired Otto in August 2016 for nearly $700 million and put Levandowski in charge of efforts to develop fully autonomous cars. (Uber calls the suit “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.”) Waymo v. Uber Alex Davies Google’s Lawsuit Against Uber Revolves Around Frickin’ Lasers Aarian Marshall A Simple Theory for Uber’s Waymo Mess: Plain Old Sloppiness Aarian Marshall Judge in Waymo Dispute Lets Uber’s Self-Driving Program Live—for Now Kalanick has said autonomous vehicles are crucial to Uber’s long-term future: If another company gets there first, it could provide a far cheaper rival service by cutting out the human drivers who take a cut of the fares. Judge William Alsup cut the company a temporary break in May and denied Waymo’s request to ban Uber from using any ill-gotten info to develop its tech until the case is resolved. But he barred Levandowski from lidar work—and then Uber fired him this month, citing his noncompliance with their legal team. Uber’s next big date in court is set for October. Best-Case Scenario: Uber wins the case and powers on with its self-driving project. Worst Case: Waymo uncovers evidence that Uber used stolen tech in its autonomous vehicle development, leading to a big loss in court. If it does lose, Uber could have to sit out the self-driving race until Waymo has gained back its lead, and/or pay out millions in damages. Meanwhile, Judge Alsup has referred the trade secrets case to the Department of Justice. A criminal investigation could follow, putting Levandowski and other non-fired Uber executives at risk of landing in prison, says Shawn Thompson, a former FBI attorney and federal prosecutor. 2. The Greyball Investigation In March, The New York Times revealed that Uber had for years been using a program called Greyball, which allowed Uber to keep users who might be working for regulators or law enforcement from using its service. Greyball's purpose: to help Uber avoid detection in cities that prohibited it from operating. Uber admitted to using the program, and now the Department of Justice has opened a criminal probe. (Uber declined to comment on the DOJ investigation.) If prosecutors determine Uber illegally obstructed authorities from enforcing laws or improperly used credit card information (the company allegedly used credit card data as part of its effort to identify users it was trying to sideline), they could file racketeering charges. But the investigation could also prove benign. “This [kind of investigation] happens a lot, particularly when there are big, high-profile companies and articles about things they’ve done that offend people,” says Timothy Heaphy, a former US attorney now at the law firm Hunton & Williams. Best Case: Federal prosecutors conclude their investigation without finding proof Uber did anything wrong. Worst Case: Conviction under these federal charges could result in significant fines, further hurting Uber's financial situation. 3. Setting Fire to Cash Uber generated more than $6.5 billion in revenue in 2016, according to numbers it shared with Bloomberg. Sounds good, right? Problem is, Uber lost nearly twice what it did in 2015, ending the year $2.8 billion in the red. The good news for the company is that its revenue growth could outpace losses soon. “I figure they have something like one and a half, two and a half years’ of cash they could continue to burn at the current rate,” says Evan Rawley, who teaches strategy at Columbia University Business School. If the company wants to avoid taking a valuation hit, expect fares to increase and driver profits to dip, especially in markets where competitors (cough, Lyft) are trailing badly. Best Case: Uber beats back competitors, its revenue increases enough to outweigh heavy losses, and the whole thing starts turning a profit, justifying its valuation of nearly $70 billion. Worst Case: Uber continues to subsidize fares to lure in new users and drivers, pushing profitability further away. The Waymo and Greyball cases could pile on financial penalties, making the situation worse. If the company loses too much cash, it’ll have to raise money again, diluting shareholders' equity. Longtime investors could revolt, Rawley says, leading to a change up top—bye-bye, Travis K?—and an unstable future. 4. Toxic Culture In February, Susan Fowler, a former programmer at Uber, published a blog post saying she had been sexually harassed and discriminated against while at the company. And, she said, her complaints went unheard in a corporate culture that values performance above all. In response, Kalanick tweeted, "What's described here is abhorrent & against everything we believe in." An internal investigation followed, turning up 215 claims of inappropriate behavior and leading Uber this week to fire those 20 employees. Uber has also brought in former US attorney general Eric Holder to do his own independent assessment. His report is due at the end of June. Meanwhile, Uber’s recent diversity report showed progress, at least compared to the rest of Silicon Valley. Also this week, Uber fired Asia Pacific business head Eric Alexander, who stands accused of obtaining and holding onto the medical files of a woman raped during an Uber ride in India. (Uber reportedly feared the rape was a fabrication by a competitor.) Best Case: Uber commits to improvement, continuing to punish bad actors and working to diversify the workplace—even before reporters force their hands. Kalanick brings in a conscientious and thoughtful person to be his first COO and balance out his company's “ask forgiveness, not permission” tendencies. Worst Case: It doesn’t, and he doesn’t. Bad PR translates into a rekindling of the #deleteUber campaign and the departure of good workers, or the inability to hire new ones—from entry to executive level. “Nobody likes a sexist organization that abuses its employees,” Robert Siegel, who studies strategy and innovation at Stanford Business School, told WIRED in March. Well, duh. 5. An Executive Exodus Kalanick is working on that COO slot, but he’s got other roles to fill as well. In March, Jeff Jones, Uber’s president, resigned. “The beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber,” he told Recode at the time. High-ranking exec Brian McClendon, self-driving director Raffi Krikorian, senior exec Ed Baker, and Rachel Whetstone also all left around the same time. Now head of finance Gautam Gupta is on his way out, not to mention Alexander and Levandowski, both fired. “Uber was the hottest firm in the world,” says Rawley. “I think the ardor has probably cooled in some quarters.” An executive-level job would still be a golden ticket for most tech strivers. But given departures, firings, bad PR, and rumors of a truly terrible work environment, the company may not be able to catch the cream. “It’s not an ideal job for someone who has got a lot of talent and a good job already, which is what they need,” says Rawley. Then again, Uber just hired artificial intelligence superstar Raquel Urtasun to work on its autonomous-driving efforts. Best Case: Uber uses the company’s great product, well-established customer base, and unique challenges to find excellent people and get the company back on track. Worst Case: Culture starts at the top. If Uber doesn’t add to its roster, the environment won’t shift, jobs will go unfilled, and money won’t be made. Without cash, it’s going to be really hard for the company to right the tailspin.

(Google via AP) NEW YORK (AP) — Anyone who has waited on a long, snaking line to get into a fashion exhibit at a top museum knows just how popular they've become — and more broadly, how fashion is increasingly seen as a form of artistic and cultural expression. Google Inc. is acknowledging this reality by expanding its Google Art Project — launched in 2011 to link users with art collections around the world, online — to include fashion. The new initiative , "We Wear Culture," which launched Thursday, uses Google's technology to connect fashion lovers to collections and exhibits at museums and other institutions, giving them the ability to not only view a garment, but to zoom in on the hem of a dress, examine a sleeve or a bit of embroidery on a gown up close, wander around an atelier, or sit down with Metropolitan Museum of Art costume restorers. The project partners with more 180 cultural institutions, including the Met's Costume Institute, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, Japan's Kyoto Costume Institute, and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. It comprises over 30,000 garments. The site also offers specially curated exhibits. You can click your way to, for example, a curated photo exhibit on Tokyo Street Style, or an exploration of women's gowns in the 18th century. You can search by designer, or by their muse — examining, say, Marilyn Monroe's love of Ferragamo stiletto heels, via the Museo Salvatore Ferragamo in Florence, Italy. At a preview demonstration this week, Amit Sood, director of the Google Cultural Institute and designer of the Google Art Project (now called Google Arts & Culture) explained that he wasn't initially clued into the possibilities for fashion, because at the tech giant, "we all wear hoodies." But, he said, collaborating with an institution like the Met showed him that "art and fashion have a long history together." The idea behind the new project, he said, is to tell the story — or rather, the multiple stories — behind fashion. There are several virtual reality films included in the project. A 360-degree video displays the Met's conservation studio, with conservators explaining how they keep delicate clothing strong enough for display — one of them explaining, for example, how the team uses needles designed for eye surgeons. It is the ultimate fragility of clothes, though, that makes the project appealing to museum curators, explained Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute's head curator — whereas many garments are too delicate to be permanently displayed, digitizing a collection makes it viewable forever. The Costume Institute has provided 500 of the objects on display, noted Loic Tallon, the Met's chief digital officer. Making a pitch to young users, the site also features YouTube personality Ingrid Nilsen in short videos, in which she explains the evolution of the hoodie, the choker, or colorful Japanese "Sukajan" jackets. ___ Online: https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/project/fashion Tags Wire Arts And Entertainment Lifestyle Fashion Art Museums Visual Arts Museums Leisure Travel Travel Recreation And Leisure Locations Japan East Asia Asia View (…) comments Follow Go!

In this post, rather than GIVE you content marketing ideas, I’m going to tell you how (or where) to GET them. Mostly, you “steal” them. But as I hope you know, I don’t mean you plagiarize the content other brands publish - that’ll get you nowhere. What I mean is marketing ideas are inspired by a myriad of resources - online and off. The long list that follows explains exactly what I mean. I rely on these resources and you should too. 1. Search Begin a search in Google or Bing. You’re not only going to find a quick little surplus of ideas, but ideas people actually search for. Because… The search engine will attempt to guess what you’re searching for. As it detects your intention, it will suggest ideas. This is called Google Autocomplete. Somewhere on the page, often at the top, you may see common questions (“People also ask”) and answers, a feature that appears as an increasingly common response when searches are phrased as questions. Of course, the search results themselves may give you ideas. And for most searches, at the bottom of the page, you’ll see “Searches related to….” More ideas. 2. Competitors’ blogs and FAQs If you’re not eyeing the content your competitors create, you should. You might even want to setup Google Alerts or any media monitoring tool to keep tabs on your competitors and your industry at large. Check out their blogs and content hubs. You’re likely to find topics you can cover better, or differently. The same goes for the FAQ. Perhaps your answer to what a competitor claims is a frequently asked question merits developing an article or some form of content. Perhaps your big muscular answer makes theirs look weak. 3. Books Say hello to Amazon, a haven of content ideas. What do people write books about in your industry? “Look inside” a relevant book (a feature most Amazon books offer). Whoa… the preview feature shows you the book’s table of contents, which may contain all kinds of content marketing ideas. 4. eBooks eBooks, of the freebie variety, are offered on Amazon, Scribd, SlideShare, and well, everywhere. The companies you compete with certainly market them - searching for eBooks on a specific topic will present them to you. Mine them for ideas, or take one you like and do something different with it. I’ve written numerous successful blog posts based on an eBook, or a collection of them. They often contain quotes, statistics, research, examples, and other components that make it easier to include highly credible citations and links. 5. Magazines Remember magazines? I don’t buy as many as I once did, but I haven’t forgotten them. I subscribe to several in the digital marketing realm. Most of them are free. I don’t read them cover-to-cover - in fact, sometimes I don’t get to them at all - but often, they become my reading material at the gym or for late night reading (is that sad?). In any case, they give me ideas. I don’t mean to rail on any publisher in particular, but I’ll tell you most of the magazines I get about my field - digital marketing - feature fairly lightweight articles. Magazines do that. However, the topics often have potential, so they inspire ideas for me to create posts, eBooks, infographics, slide decks, videos, etc. 6. Research Research rocks content marketing - that is, published research reports. Join the mailing list of leaders in your industry and pay special attention when they publish research. It’s gold. Next, use parts of it in your content. Or mine it for ideas. One of my most popular posts, What Social Media Tactics Are Most Effective?, literally plucks the idea from Social Media Examiner’s annual industry research report. They listed the most common questions their readers ask. I decided to answer the top one. I did so simply by researching and rounding up the best content on the topic based on reading the posts that came up on the first page of search. 7. Courses Online courses are everywhere and aggregated, for your convenience, on services such as Udemy, Skillshare and LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda). Much like books, they are chapterized, so a quick review of the course outline (a table of contents) is bound to be full of ideas. 8. Conferences Here’s one of those online and off resources. Offline - or in the real world - you can attend conferences (and probably should for networking purposes). When you do, you’ll have the chance to experience several helpful keynotes, sessions and workshops. You’ll also be given a program. Keep that thing and refer to it when seeking a content marketing idea. Even if you can’t make it to a conference, the agendas of conferences past and future are published online. Conference organizers will carefully vet ideas for sessions submitted by potential speakers. They tend to select the ones they believe will draw the most interest. Now there’s a cool shortcut - someone else, probably a committee of experts, has done the research for you. Virtual summits have all kinds of models, but are essentially conferences as well, so if your industry offers them, the same strategy can be applied. 9. Podcasts You may be producing podcasts, listening to them, or ignoring the podcasting revolution. But understand: podcasting also presents a place and resource for mining content marketing ideas. Can’t find the time? You need not listen. I must admit, though I have a podcast, I seldom listen to them. What I’m suggesting is that you simply peruse the titles of the podcasts for ideas. 10. TV Are there television stations and networks broadcasting programs related to your industry? You can use your remote control to peruse the programs by doing a search. Or you can use the web. There’s no doubt in my mind that television programming pros are not producing shows on topics no one cares about. For me, talk shows and demonstration shows come to mind. For instance, folks like Dr. Oz and Rachel Ray are creating shows, or program segments, about topics the viewers appreciate. Thanks to the proliferation of stations, examples of highly specific programs about highly specific topics are nearly endless. 11. YouTube Internet TV applies here too. What’s Maria Forleo up to? What are vloggers like Jenna Marbles doing? Which shows are killing it for views in your field? Do a search on YouTube and gather all kinds of ideas. 12. Buzzsumo You may serve a highly specific niche, and benefit from content whether or not it reached a lot of eyeballs and earned a lot of mentions. However, learning what has indeed earned substantial social media shares and links will be helpful in your quest to discover effective content marketing ideas. Use Buzzsumo to search by topic, URL or author. You’ll get an instant report on posts and pages that performed best. I often search Buzzsumo to see the results leaders in my field get from their content. The big winners often spark ideas worthy of content development. 13. Quora The popular Q&A website Quora is a forum for just about everything. The questions there, and answers, will give you ideas. Be sure to check out the related questions. 14. Wikipedia Wikipedia is like the world’s HQ for finding tables of contents or related ideas. Seriously, search anything. Bam! You could find: Detailed posts Links galore A table of contents to inspire a crazy number of ideas A “See also” section with even more ideas Notes (footnotes), references, further reading, external links And more For most inquiries or topics, Wikipedia is so rich with content marketing ideas that you may not even need another source. 15. News aggregators I got this idea (and hundreds more) from Andy Crestodina on his blog at Orbit Media. (I’m a contributor there.) Andy explains news aggregators pull blog feeds and newsletters together and can therefore be a rich source of ideas. Andy recommends Feedly and Alltop and writes they are “…great for both research and organization.” He says, “Search for your topic and scan through the headlines with your next post in mind. Within minutes, you should spot a few themes and memes that you can repurpose on your blog.” 16. Blog comments You have a blog, right? It’s the main reason you’re reading this long list post about where to get content ideas. Does your blog welcome comments and questions from readers? The truth is bloggers feature comment sections less than they used to, which is probably because readers chime in less than they used to. Still, whether it be on your blog or elsewhere, blog comments are easy to find and capture cool things such as: Questions and challenges readers have Objections readers have Links to related resources And potentially, ideas for expanding your content regarding topics readers have shown interest in 17. Email For better or worse, I subscribe to a ton of email newsletters and updates from marketers, influencers, and relevant industry publishers. I suspect you do too. I must admit, my morning routine generally consists of zapping 95% of them - and from time to time I go on an opt-out rampage - however, I read the subject and from lines and click-through at least a few times everyday. And that inspires ideas. You absolutely need to monitor what’s being published in your niche and, when you’re shopping for ideas, email will help feed them to you. 18. Phone calls and conversations This may be the most under-appreciated or least mined source on the list. You’re having conversations with prospects, customers, and various types of associates daily, right? These conversations inevitably invoke questions. Your challenge is to pay close enough attention to record them for posterity. The questions people ask you and the issues they face - especially when they care enough to take the time to ask you in conversation - are likely the most important topics you need to tackle with your content. 19. Idea generators If you’re main game is marketing, you’re probably aware other marketers (with the required resources) create free idea generation tools. If you moonlight as a marketer, now you know. There are quite a few worth trying… Answer the Public is quite handy for generating a mindmap of related ideas and questions. Portent’s Content Idea Generator actually takes multiple stabs at crafting headlines for you. Wordstream created a post about idea generation tools that offers even more. 20. Keyword tools Keyword tools are everywhere, free and paid. Of course, if you’re a serious SEO researcher, you’ll want to consider the paid tools and identify the feature sets and fees that work best for you. Here, for the simple purpose of hunting for content marketing ideas, I’ll present three you’re likely to find helpful and easy to use. Google AdWords Keyword Planner - This free tool from Google was created to help marketers plan pay-per-click ad campaigns. However, whether you buy ads or not, the tool will generate lists of related keywords based on the terms you enter and broadly estimate search volume, making it a good starting point for content marketing ideas. Ubersuggest Keyword Tool.io Ubersuggest and KeywordTool are similar and focus on generating a long list of related search terms - largely of the long tail variety - in an alphabetical format. Search volume is not indicated with the free versions. There is, to a limited degree, a variety of ways to stratify searches (by search engines and search types). Ubersuggest includes a word cloud display option, but it’s probably more of a toy than a tool. 21. SlideShare SlideShare, a LinkedIn company, is a massive content hub, where presentations, documents, and infographics are uploaded. The service doesn’t appear to thrive to the degree it once did, however, LinkedIn claims to have 18 million uploads in 40 content categories. Chances are, a little searching and clicking around on SlideShare will help stir up some ideas. I’ve used it as a research tool for years and occasionally base content on what I find there, cite it as a source, or even embed the content when it’s helpful. 22. Pinterest Today, Pinterest is one of the top 60-70ish websites in the world (Alexa rank of 63). And although it’s known to skew toward a female audience, believe me, there's no subject you can search for on Pinterest that won’t return an amazing amount of content. Pinterest also sends you amazing emails based on your interests. Warning: Pinterest is highly addictive. 23. Google Alerts Google Alerts basically brings search results to you, for free, and at whatever interval you choose. Google Alerts will send you emails when it finds web pages, newspaper articles, blogs, or research that match the search terms you sign up for. I love it. I use it to monitor my name, website, books, the areas of interest I write about in digital marketing, and the categories/topics my clients do business in. If your monitoring (and swiping ideas) for something specific, you definitely want Google Alerts in your arsenal. 24. Social media channels I’ll say it again: social media is the greatest market research tool ever. The almighty hashtag, lists, groups, communities, lists, chats, discussions, analytics… Slice it how you will, but understand the conversation about whatever it is you’re looking to have a conversation about is taking place on the popular social media channels. And, in my mind, what makes it so great as a research tool for finding content marketing ideas, is it’s “au naturel.” What I mean by that is it’s not masked by editors. Consumers create the content. How can social media not provide important clues about what people care about? 25. Forums I have to admit, I’m not much of a forums guy - but I’m not trying to market to me. And though it may be “old school” Internet, there are forums about everything. And you know what takes place there? People search for the answers and advice they seek. Find a forum in your niche simply by including the word “forum” in a search and you’ll see what I mean. When you find the right one (or more), you may never need another source of content marketing ideas. 26. Groups I believe LinkedIn was the trailblazer of social media groups, but Facebook appears to the reigning king. Your call as to which groups sound more appealing or deliver more insights for your niche. The point is, like forums, there are groups about everything. Unlike forums, on social channels, they are often moderated by an organizer who decides how “open” the group is or isn’t. In any case, by becoming a member in a LinkedIn or Facebook group, you’ll be in the company of like-minded people who ask smart questions, deliver personal insights regarding them, and offer valuable resources. You’ll gather ideas, I promise. Of course, you can also start your own group, as I have done (with my co-author) to support my new book, The Road to Recognition. Conversations there are often about book promotion. 27. Sales people Perhaps it should be more obvious: the people who field questions from prospects are the most likely to know what questions need to be answered. Treat them as a resource. Ask your sales people to record and share the questions prospects ask. Ask them to mine their email and presentations to determine worthwhile topics. Ask them if they run into dead-ends when trying to source content for specific customer challenges. 28. Customer service people Here again, we’re looking at the people in your company with customer-facing roles. Those manning the chats, taking support calls, conducting training, solving technical problems, or providing any type of post-sale service should be intimately familiar with topics that need tending to. 29. Staff Sure, the sales and support people should be your first couple of stops, but if everyone in the company is pulling their weight, everyone in the company could contribute to the content ideation party. Hit up your people for ideas. What are they seeing streaming across social media? What do they hear? A content ideation pizza party or happy hour might be fruitful and fun. 30. Help section If your company’s site has a help or support section on its site, dig into it. Wander your way into your competitor’s help sections too. What topics could use more informed answers? What ideas could be expanded? You might find help requests where the only response was a written answer or customer comments. Would a video, diagram, screenshot or downloadable asset make for a better response? Maybe the reverse is the case: a video provides help, but a blog post or guide does not. 31. Onsite search Does your website and/or blog have a search mechanism? The data it captures is bound to tell you exactly what people are looking for - which is exactly what you need to create content about. 32. Interviews Interviews are everywhere in every media, and pertinent questions, insights and ideas pour forth from the mouths of both the interviewers and interviewees. You can read interviews, watch and listen to them, or conduct them and you’re bound to discover content marketing ideas. 33. Your friends and family It’s possible this final idea of mine has never occurred to you. Conduct conversations with your friends and family about what you do. They’re very likely to respond with questions you can use. They may bring you that “outsider” perspective you never could have, but should have discovered, otherwise. Sometimes it just makes for a great story. I remember once, I read something that expressed the idea that the best content marketers are the essentially great teachers. I decided to do a post about the qualities of a great teacher. So I asked my kids over dinner: Who are your best teachers? Why do you like them best? Their answers were pure, unadulterated, gold. I began taking furious notes and created a wonderful post soon after. Useful content marketing ideas are everywhere Want to turn searchers into visitors? Visitors into leads? Leads into customers? Tune into some new sources, heed what you hear, and turn out some inspired stuff that’ll be helpful.

JEFF PACHOUD/AFP/Getty Images On Android, Google Maps can be more passive aggressive than a supervisor who’d really “prefer” that you didn’t take that four-day weekend in July. I turn off my cell phone’s GPS when I don’t need it, so every time I open the app it stops me to ask that I turn “location services” back on. Every. Time. This is aggravating, but seeing it as often as I do only makes me more dedicated to keep the sensor off when it isn’t necessary. I like to imagine some data scientist at Google pounding the table and yelling, “Should we send him an ad for Chipotle or the Olive Garden? We just don’t know where he is!” No one can hide their location from their mobile carrier, however. Carriers always know which cell towers its customers are near at all times. The only way to hide from them is by turning your phone off. So that’s one data advantage a carrier will always have over Google, the predominant seller of ads on the web. That kind of information should really help Verizon as it closes in on its acquisition of Yahoo (and Yahoo’s online advertising business) next week, and every time a telecom pokes its giant nose into online advertising just further strengthens Mountain View’s resolve to move the whole internet over to encrypted connections. Just like Google bugs me to turn on my GPS, it’s bugging everyone who publishes online to turn on encryption. Chrome gets a bit more nudgey about it every year. There’s good reasons for an encrypted web, but Google has its own reasons. “It’s a defensive move by all these tech companies against the telecoms,” Juan Margenat, the chief operating officer of Marfeel, explained to the Observer. Marfeel optimizes content publishers’ sites for mobile, including on Facebook Instant Articles and Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages. The Marfeel blog has a four-part series about how tech companies and telecoms went from friendly relations to outright animosity. If that language sounds extreme, it helps to look at an example from abroad. Last year, Israeli ad blocking company Shine (now Rainbow) had three global carriers signed up for network wide ad blocking services.  This meant that carriers could block any or all ads that would have shown up on cell phones. They could just block it all, to save money on bandwidth, or offer blocking as an add-on service to customers. This was of course a huge threat to companies that distribute ads online, and Google is the biggest of those companies. But Shine’s plans fell apart when European regulators said they would prohibit network-wide blocking, as the Financial Times reported. Nevertheless, the advertising giants remembered: the symbiosis of the telecoms and the tech industry was over. This helps explain Google’s ever increasing insistence that online content shifts to encrypted connections. We’ve reported a lot on encrypting websites here, but here’s a quick recap: Websites can send their traffic to web browsers in an encrypted fashion when the publisher and the viewer’s browser exchange keys and send data back and forth muddled with that key, so only the sender and recipient can read it. Telecoms can of course listen in on any traffic over their wires, but encrypted traffic will make no sense. Publishers that rely on ads have had a hard time shifting over to encrypted sites though, because so many of the online advertising networks weren’t able to deliver encrypted content. That’s changed. “Nowadays, any serious ad network is compatible with HTTPS,” Margenat said. Which helps explain why, finally, huge sites like The New York Times and Pornhub made the switch to encrypted connections this year. Further, if a website is encrypted, a telecom could block an entire website, but it couldn’t block specific content on that site, such as ads. It also couldn’t scrape which ads subscribers see in order to build market intelligence for its own ad business. Encrypting traffic shuts the telecom out entirely; web traffic just becomes photon-water in its fiber-optic pipes. HTTPS won’t prevent Verizon from publishing on lots of web pages if it can prove it has a valuable product for publishers, but it will prevent it from taking unfair advantage using its privileged position as a top-level network service provider. Verizon has tried online advertising before, but with Yahoo it gets a decently large existing business. Verizon has other advantages, too, that Google can’t block, besides location. It knows how often users change devices, how often they pay their bills, how often they move, their zip codes, where they’ve lived and on and on. Its data is valuable enough that one telecom here has been selling it to local businesses to help profile their customers, as we previously reported. Telefonica got busted doing the same thing in Germany. So it has advantages, but the ability to scrub a rival’s whole revenue stream? That would be an unfair advantage. Telecoms also haven’t given up on their efforts to stifle the flow of information to tech companies. Telefonica has announced a mobile app to control which sensors feed data to companies with apps on a users phone. Guess which sensor I would shut Google out of? The government can forbid unfair competition, but HTTPS just shuts one variety of it down, law or no law. Google has been pushing the web to HTTPS using language about internet censorship and privacy. Encryption is great, and it does protect all of that, but just remember, when Google starts using Chrome to shame websites that haven’t encrypted yet, it’s also protecting its bottom line.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS Guest Why Apple’s HomePod and other AI assistants won’t win a massive market Balaji Krishnan, DabKick@kijalab June 8, 2017 2:10 PM After decades of depictions in sci-fi, the era of consumer-level AI finally seems to be upon us. Siri is well-ensconced in our phones, while voice-activated, personal assistants like Amazon Echo, Google Assistant, and Apple’s just-announced HomePod, are all vying to become our household servants (or what Walt Mossberg recently dubbed “information appliances”). While HomePod takes a small step in the right direction, all these devices are still fundamentally designed around some highly flawed assumptions. Only when a top tech company recognizes this, and is willing to make some key course corrections, will we see consumer AI that’s worthy of the name. Here’s what I mean: Fun: Computing’s unacknowledged killer app It’s half-jokingly said that porn made the consumer Internet possible, but it’s more accurate to say fun did. Even before web browsers, desktop PC sales were largely powered by the popularity of computer games. In the early ’90s, it’s estimated that a single game, Doom, was downloaded 15-20 million times — at a time when PCs were selling 37 million units a year. Online chatrooms, comedy videos, music files, image memes, and other varieties of fun soon followed. We saw a similar pattern when the iPhone launched decade ago, with games and other kinds of interactive entertainment immediately becoming the most-used apps, which remains the case to this day. To succeed as information appliances, PCs and smartphones first had to be embraced as entertainment appliances. With that premise in mind, consider the current market of AI assistants: HomePod, Alexa, Google Home, and the rest are not likely to succeed on a mass scale because they’re missing the fun content. Another problem is marketing: Just framing these devices as “personal assistants” that can answer questions and perform useful jobs, such as ordering ride services, or in HomePod’s case, intelligently select music on request, doesn’t convey to consumers a substantial differentiator from what they can already get within seconds though Google search or another app. Which brings me to an even deeper problem: Voice is no one’s choice (except Robert Downey Jr.’s) Marketing voice command as a differentiator assumes that consumers actually want a product like Jarvis from the Iron Man films. Simply because a technology is featured in a fun movie doesn’t make it fun. In fact, the real reason sci-fi TV and movies have depicted talking computers for so long is a filmmaking conceit — it’s a good way to dramatically add computer interaction into the plot without boring shots of the hero typing on a keyboard. It’s a mystery to me why so many tech giants have pushed voice as a home-based interface with little evidence consumers are actually interested in it. According to one study last year, the vast majority of iPhone users rarely use Siri, with most of us only turning to her for navigation assistance while driving. By contrast, there are numerous online videos depicting consumers using Siri for what she was not designed for — trying to flirt with her, asking her to tell jokes or respond to insults, and so on. Users turn to Siri, in other words, not for assistance but for entertainment. So consumers who aren’t interested in talking out loud to a computer — that would be most of us — are likely to get confused as to why they would need a personal assistant at all. Especially when they already have a smartphone in arm’s reach. And their smartphones provide nearly everything they could want for digital entertainment. Wanted: One fun-loving tech giant This is why I think the real way forward for intelligent assistants belongs to a tech giant capable of creating a new kind of entertainment appliance. By marketing HomePod as a music speaker, Apple has a better approach than its competitors. But music is just one of many kinds of content that entertains us. What’s needed is a device that helps us enjoy everything digital and interactive in our homes. It would use AI to seamlessly connect our smartphones and all the content we’re already using on them to the legacy entertainment appliances that still dominate our living rooms: televisions, stereos, and home theater systems. A company with the size and range of devices of a Samsung could build this — but only, perhaps, if it could somehow inject its corporate culture with the sense of fun that made a device like Nintendo’s Wii such an early crossover hit. From a marketing standpoint, the AI or personal assistant aspect would scarcely even need to be mentioned because consumers are not accessing it for AI or assistance per se, but for fun. But that’s where it gets interesting. Users will come to such a device for fun, but machine learning integrated within the device would rapidly understand what kind of content its owners enjoy consuming and then gradually understand all their key behaviors. And only then, once we’re all readily entertained, could it become a device that also helps us with our daily chores and needs. And, at last, it would become the intelligent assistant and information appliance we’ve always hoped computers would one day be. Balaji Krishnan is a Cupertino-based entrepreneur and engineer.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Andy Rubin raises more money for Essential Products By Rei Padla - June 8, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The Android community is excited about the Essential Phone because of many reasons. It’s Andy Rubin’s latest project. In case you didn’t know, he’s the guy responsible for creating Android. He left Google a few years ago to help a startup we now know as Essential Products. The company recently rolled out the Essential Phone with an almost bezel-less display and the Essential Home that is poised to rival Google Home and Amazon Echo. Rubin and his team have been working on the new smartphone and we’ve been anticipating for its arrival. We said that phone will ship in 30 days but we’re not sure if we’d be happy after seeing the early sample photos and videos. Anyway, those are just first samples so we’ll still wait before get our hands on one and perform our own review. For this project, the startup raised money to begin and finally bring the phone into production. We have no idea who gave their investments but we learned in March that SoftBank backed out of the multi-million dollar investment. Now that the first Essential products have been introduced in the market, the company is now prepping for market release. According to a recent Bloomberg report, the startup has close to $1 billion in investment values. The amount of $300 million was recently added, rounding it up to about $900 million. Investors have not been disclosed according to Equidate. The figures are high for a small startup but it’s understandable because Essential started from Playground Global–the company Rubin put up after leaving Google. Playground Global is believed to have bigger control over Essential Products now. Looking at Essential’s website, some of the early investors include Foxconn Technology Group, Tencent Holdings Ltd., and Altimeter Capital. The SoftBank deal didn’t push through because Apple was believed to be joining the Japanese mobile carrier. Rubin didn’t want that. At this point, Essential Phone and the Essential Home are anticipated to make significant changes in the industries they are entering. The Essential Phone also runs Android while Essential Home works with a number of products and services. The company is one of the newest players in gadget town so we’re looking forward to how well it will perform.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Pixel XL vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus News VSby Mitja Rutnik9 hours ago 13 429 10 While the Google Pixel XL and Apple iPhone 7 Plus are far from new devices, they are both important flagships for their respective companies. For iOS fans, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus represent the very best of what Apple has to offer. For Google, the Pixel and Pixel XL showcase what a premium, stock Android phone is truly capable of. Of course we are talking about Apples to Oranges Androids here. While the iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel XL share some similarities, they are quite different from one another in a lot of ways. While we might be late to the game, with the summer slow taking hold, we thought it would be a perfect time to revisit some of the major flagships currently on the market. In this post, we’ll compare the two smartphones in terms of specs, design, software, price, and more. We’ll take a closer look at what exactly sets them apart, so you’ll have a better idea of which device might be better for you. See also: Problems with the Google Pixel and Pixel XL and how to fix them May 8, 2017 Design Although the Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus look quite a bit different from one another (especially the back), they both have a very minimalistic and simple design. Google’s smartphone has a metal body with the addition of a small glass window on the back, which gives it a little bit more character. Despite this, Google has played it safe when it comes to design, as the Pixel XL doesn’t really stand out from the crowd. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as design is very subjective, but it’s still something that’s worth pointing out. Apple’s flagship also has a metal body and looks more or less the same as the previous two iPhone generations, with some minor differences here and there. It’s not the most compact device you can get, as in addition to its 5.5-inch screen it also has quite large bezels on the top and at the bottom, which might make the device a bit difficult to hold and use if you have smaller hands. The bezels on the Pixel XL aren’t small either, and they definitely can’t compare to those of the Samsung Galaxy S8, for example. However, they are a little bit smaller than those of the iPhone. A big difference between the two smartphones is the position of the fingerprint scanner. The Pixel XL has it on the back, while the iPhone has it on the front, below the screen. It’s impossible to say what is better in this case, as we all have a different opinion on this topic. Personally, I prefer a front-mounted fingerprint scanner just because it’s easier to unlock the device while it’s on a table. That way, I don’t have to pick it up every time I want to quickly check something. But hey, that’s just me. Moving on to the color options, the iPhone 7 is available in a total of six different colors. You can get the device in Jet Black, Black, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold. There’s also a special edition of the smartphone available that comes in red. The Pixel XL, on the other hand, can be yours in three color options. These include Very Silver and Quite Black as well as the limited edition Really Blue, which currently isn’t available on Google’s online store. There’s no real winner when it comes to design. As already mentioned, this topic is subjective, so you’ll have to decide for yourself which one looks better. You can check out more images of both devices in the gallery below. Camera The camera is one of the main selling points of the Pixel XL. The device features a 12.3 MP sensor with an f/2.0 aperture, 1.55µm pixel size, electronic image stabilization, and dual-LED flash. When Google took the wraps off the Pixel XL, it actually said that it features the best camera you can get on a smartphone. These claims were later also confirmed by DxO, which gave the camera the highest DxOMark rating at the time with a score of 89. However, it‘s worth pointing out that Google has since dropped down to second place, as DxO gave a higher score (90) to the HTC U11 a few weeks ago. Pixel XL camera samples Just like the Pixel XL, the iPhone 7 Plus also has a great camera. Unlike its rival, it features a dual-camera setup on the back. The smartphone is equipped with a 12 MP main camera with an f/1.8 aperture, 1.22μm pixel size, phase detection auto-focus, optical image stabilization, and quad-LED dual-tone flash. It also sports a secondary 12 MP 56mm telephoto lens that offers 2x optical zoom without reducing quality. Unfortunately, DxO hasn’t reviewed the iPhone 7 Plus, so we don’t have a DxOMark to share with you at this point. Apple iPhone 7 Plus  camera samples On paper, it’s hard to decide which device is the winner in the photography department. In good lighting conditions, both smartphones can produce great looking images. However, the Pixel XL does perform better in low-light conditions, where the difference between the two is quite obvious. To see for yourself, check out the sample images taken with the Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus above. Specs Being a flagship, the Pixel XL features high-end specs. It has a 5.5-inch AMOLED screen with QHD resolution (2560 x 1440 pixels) that’s protected against scratches by Gorilla Glass 4. The smartphone is powered by the Snapdragon 821 chipset and has 4 GB of RAM. It offers either 32 or 128 GB of storage that, unfortunately, can’t be expanded, as you won’t find a microSD slot on the Pixel XL. The Pixel XL also sports a 3,400 mAh battery, a USB Type-C port, and an 8 MP front-facing selfie snapper. To learn more about the device’s primary camera, check out the Camera section above. The smartphone is also splash and dust resistant thanks to the IP53 rating. To be more specific, the rating means that the Pixel XL isn’t completely dust-tight but should work fine unless it’s exposed to massive amounts of it. When it comes to water, it can only handle being sprayed here and there. The iPhone 7 Plus has the same screen size as its rival at 5.5-inches but offers a lower resolution — Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels). It’s powered by the A10 Fusion chipset and has 3 GB of RAM, 1 GB less than the Pixel XL. There are three storage variants available to choose from: 32, 128, and 256 GB. You’ll have to choose wisely, as the device doesn’t support expandable storage. Although they are roughly the same size, the iPhone 7 Plus sports a smaller battery than the Pixel XL. It is non-removable and has a capacity of 2,900 mAh. However, the iPhone’s screen does have a lower resolution at Full HD, which doesn’t consume as much power as the QHD panel found on its rival. Apple’s flagship is dust and water resistant, as it’s IP67 certified. What this means is that it’s completely dust-tight and can be submerged in up to 1 meter of water for a period of 30 minutes. A big difference between the iPhone 7 Plus and its rival is the headphone jack. The Pixel XL does have it, while you won’t find it on the iPhone. To use your pair of headphones with the device, you’ll have to plug them in with the help of an adapter, which comes included in the box. Or you could just opt for wireless Bluetooth headphones instead. On paper, the Pixel XL beats the iPhone 7 Plus when it comes to specs. However, there’s more to this story, since Apple controls both the software and hardware experience and doesn’t have to make its software work with tons of phone models — unlike Android. That means that Apple’s phone can perform just as well – or arguably better, depending on who you ask – despite having worse specs on paper. Ultimately, both are high-end devices and should handle just about anything you throw at them. The iPhone offers more protection based on its IP67 rating but doesn’t have the headphone jack, which might be a deal breaker for some.   Pixel XL Apple iPhone 7 Plus Display 5.5-inch AMOLED display Quad HD resolution, 534 ppi 5.5-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD display Full HD resolution, 401 ppi Processor 2.15 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor Adreno 530 GPU 2.34 GHz Apple A10 Fusion processor PowerVR Series7XT Plus RAM 4 GB 3 GB Storage 32/128 GB not expandable 32/128/256 GB not expandable Camera 12.3 MP rear camera, f/2.0 aperture, EIS, dual LED flash 8 MP front-facing camera Dual 12 MP rear camera, f/1.8 aperture, OIS, quad-LED flash 7 MP front-facing camera Battery 3,450 mAh 2,900 mAh Software Android 7.1 Nougat iOS 10 Dimensions 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5 mm 168 grams 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm 188 grams Software Software is definitely the biggest difference between the two devices. The Pixel XL ships with Android 7.1 Nougat on board, while the iPhone 7 Plus runs iOS 10. Google’s smartphone offers a stock Android experience a lot of users love. It’s easy to use and also has a ton of customization features. If you love playing around with different settings and options then Android is definitely the way to go. Apple’s operating system is quite different. The company’s plan has always been to make it as simple as possible to use and it has done a good job in this regard. However, by not having an app drawer, like the one you’ll find on most Android devices, things can get a bit disorganized, as all the apps are placed on the home screen. You do have the option of placing apps in folders (just like on Android), which is something that’s probably a must if you have a lot of them installed on your device. Until recently, a big difference between Android and iOS was that the former features Google’s Assistant, while the latter has Siri on board. Both digital assistants offer quite a few similar functionalities and they allow you to interact with your device using your voice. However, during Google I/O last month, the online search giant launched Assistant for iPhones. What this means is that you now have the option of using either Google’s digital assistant or Siri (or both) on Apple’s smartphones. The battle between which is better, Android or iOS, has been a hot topic for a while now. They are different in a lot of ways, so it’s almost impossible to say which one comes out on top. That’s a decision you’ll have to make on your own. But the fact remains that Android does offer more options and features for you to play around with, which is something a lot of users do appreciate. iOS, on the other hand, is all about simplicity. Final thoughts Both the Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus are, without a doubt, great smartphones. The Pixel XL offers a bit more in terms of specs, has a headphone jack, and a better camera, at least when it comes to low-light performance. The iPhone, on the other hand, offers more protection thanks to the IP67 rating and comes equipped with a dual-camera setup with 2x optical zoom. So, which device should you get? Well, that’s a question you’ll have to answer for yourself. We personally prefer the Pixel XL, as it offers more bang for the buck and obviously runs Android, which just brings more to the table when compared to iOS.

Tech Search Search Climate ChangeRichard Branson Calls President Trump ‘Naive’ For Leaving the Paris Climate Agreement United KingdomU.K. Election Deals Theresa May a Crushing Blow, Blurring Brexit Talks United KingdomSterling Drops as Theresa May Falls Short of Majority in U.K. Election EntrepreneurHere’s Where Most Startups Fail Photographed by Getty Images Google Google Slammed For Blocking Ads While Allowing User Tracking Mathew Ingram Jun 08, 2017 Google recently confirmed plans for a new version of its Chrome browser that will have ad-blocking features built in, which the company says will help users avoid annoying ads online. The search giant is coming under fire for not blocking another annoying and intrusive aspect of web browsers, however—namely, the fact that they track their users' behavior and personal data. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation digital-rights group pointed out on Wednesday, Apple just announced a new version of its Safari browser that will not only block certain types of annoying ads, but will also disable user tracking. Google's update is focused solely on blocking what it says are obtrusive ads such as auto-playing videos and ads that have a timer that counts down before users can see the content they're seeking. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. "At the EFF, we understand that advertising funds much of the media and services online, but we also believe that users have the right to protect themselves against tracking," researcher Alan Toner wrote in an essay published by the foundation. "Advertising is currently built around a surveillance architecture, and this has to change." Google's decision to block certain types of advertising by default in the next version of its browser, to be released sometime next year, has been criticized by publishers and antitrust experts because of its dominant position in the digital ad market. According to a recent research report from Pivotal analyst Brian Wieser, Google and Facebook combined control more than 75% of the $70 billion U.S. digital ad market, and the two companies alone accounted for almost all the growth in the market last year. That dominant position is likely also the reason Google doesn't want to block user tracking, since advertisers rely on those methods to target ads effectively. Apple has no real advertising business, and therefore it doesn't mind cutting off tracking in its browser. And the company has previously stressed that it doesn't invade its users' privacy the way that companies like Google and Facebook do. In his essay, the EFF researcher also notes that in addition to blocking ads, Google is offering publishers a new feature called Funding Choices, which will allow them to offer users the ability to turn off third-party ad blocking software and pay the publisher directly for content. Even if users choose to do this, however, they can still be tracked by advertisers, Toner says. The new feature lets people pay sites to avoid being shown ads "but does not prevent Google, the site, or any other advertisers from continuing to track people who pay." Toner says the advertising industry has repeatedly rebuffed efforts to come up with a standard for opting out of tracking, like the Do Not Track program that was initially proposed in 2011. Industry groups endorsed the idea but then pulled out of the implementation process and have refused to honor it. "The industry's sole response has been to create a system called AdChoices, which offers users a complicated and inefficient opt-out from targeted ads, but not from the data collection and the behavioral tracking behind the targeting," the EFF researcher said.

Google app v7.4 beta prepares for Google Home calling, manual rerouting of voice commands, and more [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/06/07 1:49pm PDTJun 7, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 32 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Videos Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Calling through Google Home 1.2 Manual control over which Assistant answers 1.3 Independence Day [US-Only] 1.4 Notification access for easier access to contacts and messages 2 Download There's another version of the Google app floating around in the wild, and as we've probably become accustomed, it doesn't appear to make any notable changes upon installation. However, there are some interesting elements floating around in the apk. In this update, we can see the first signs of support for making calls with Google Home and a new action that allows users to manually reroute voice commands to the device in their hand. There's also a new feature that looks at your notifications in an effort to give easier access and suggests about your contacts and messages. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Calling through Google Home Google announced this one at I/O, so it's far from a surprise that things are starting to show up in the Google app. Think of this section as a status update. In case you missed it, the announcement at I/O declared that it will soon be possible to use Google Home a bit like a speakerphone. More specifically, you'll be able to start and carry through a call on Google Home. There were still a lot of unanswered questions, but a few of those might be cleared up with this teardown. To begin with, some people have predicted that the call still occurs through the caller's phone, but the audio is traveling over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, while others have suggested a phone number will be linked to Google Home and calls will be made through the Google Voice infrastructure. It appears that the latter of the two is the winner. Some of the new strings show that users will link their phone service to Google Home for outgoing calls. Another common question is whether or not people will be able to answer incoming calls through Google Home. At the moment, only outgoing calls are mentioned in the strings, which hints that incoming calls might not be supported. On the other hand, this implementation doesn't look finished, and support could be added in the future, so this is far from conclusive. code <string name="assistant_settings_active_phone_service_category_title">Linked phone services</string> <string name="assistant_phone_preference">assistantPhone</string> <string name="assistant_settings_more_phone_servicer_category_title">Other phone services</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_title">Phone</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_default_snackbar_text">%1$s is your default phone service.</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_link_dialog_text">Link your Google Account to %1$s to make calls on Google Home through Google Assistant.</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_no_preference_title">Anonymous</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_no_preference_summary">You will appear as unlisted to others</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_service_category_title">The Assistant will use the phone service provided below for outgoing calls on Google Home. E911 is not available.</string> <string name="assistant_settings_phone_unable_unlink_default">Cannot unlink your default phone service.</string> Manual control over which Assistant answers Staying with the topic of Google Home, but going wider to all devices that run Assistant, it looks like Google is still working working out the best way to handle multiple always-listening devices. A new line of text has been added that will be used to give direction to the Assistant that the device in your hand is the one that should be responding. <string name="opa_mult_devices_answer_on_phone">Answer Here</string> There are no clear signs about how this line will be used, but it looks like it will be a button on the toast message. That is to say you'll probably have a brief span of a second or two after a command is claimed by another device when you'll be able to insist it should be handled on your phone. Obviously, we all want voice commands to be handled by the perfect device each time, but since that would take some bewilderingly perfect artificial intelligence and perfect knowledge of context, that's pretty unrealistic. Most of us expect commands to at least route to the device that can handle them, not to be sucked into the black hole that is a Google Home when certain commands only work on a phone. I welcome the option to manually tell Assistant to answer on my phone. It may be a hacky workaround, but at least it gives us an out that doesn't require whispering into a phone mic or walking over to the Home unit to hit a mute button. Independence Day [US-Only] There's actually nothing special to say here – Google just added a new line for activities scheduled for July 4th, which is Independence Day in the United States. <string name="july_4th_activities">July 4th activities</string> I don't have much to read into about a line like this, but I am going to predict those of us in the US will see this in a little less than a month. :p Notification access for easier access to contacts and messages If you were paying much attention to Google I/O, you may have caught that Android O is bringing a quirky new feature called Notification Dots. In short, the Google Launcher will draw a little dot over the corner of app icons when they have pending notifications. It seems Google may have another feature planned that will also begin watching your notifications. Several new lines describe a feature that will "help you find your contacts and messages," but it needs to watch your notifications to do that. code <string name="notification_accessable_apps_category_title">Notification access</string> <string name="notification_access_desc">Google uses notifications you've received on this device to help you find your contacts and messages. This is done solely on this device and these results are only shown to you.</string> <string name="notification_enabled_apps_title">Select the apps you'd like to include:</string> <string name="notification_access_link_text">Turn off notification access</string> <string name="notification_menu_message">To give Google access to your notifications, tap the toggle above next to Google. You can change this access from Settings &gt; In Apps.</string> <string name="notification_onboarding_title">Want to see more contacts?</string> <string name="notification_onboarding_body">To see more relevant contacts and messages, turn on notification access. This means that Google can read notifications from all apps and keep the information private on your phone.</string> <string name="notification_onboarding_dismiss_button_text">NOT NOW</string> <string name="notification_onboarding_learn_more_text">Learn more</string> <string name="notification_onboarding_optin_button_text">GO TO SETTINGS</string> Reading through the new strings is a little disappointing because they only give a (very vague) sales pitch about what the feature is supposed to achieve – helping you to find your contacts and messages – and that it wants permission to do this. However, there isn't even a hint about what users can actually expect to see as an end result. In fact, the most notable thing to take from the wording is that Google is very specific that all data collected for this feature is stored locally on your device and won't be going to the cloud. While privacy is certainly important, and it's not surprise Google wants to be cautious, this means users won't have cross-device syncing or some of the more clever features that rely on server-based processing. Two other small notes can be taken from the text, though they aren't terribly helpful. The first is simply that users can configure which apps will be watched, so it'll be possible to effectively ignore notifications that are misleading to the system or you might not want to have mixing into your results. The second detail is that the option to include or exclude apps from this feature is in Settings –> In Apps, which is currently where apps are enabled for deep search. This might suggest information from notifications will also turn up through the search field, just like deep search does now, but that feels like a bit of a leap in logic. Perhaps there will be more to learn when the next update begins rolling out. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Cody Toombs If you don't live in India (or some other country with painfully slow bandwidth and crippling data caps), I'm not sure you'll see it at all. Even if you are in an area where it's going to roll out, I don't think it has been enabled yet. These things take time to implement and test, and things don't always move super quickly. Joshua So a third world Country or Canada. Got it. Oh wait, nothing comes to Canada. Duder12 Google is moving farther and farther in front of Alexa and Siri. Its going to be embarrassing for the competition if the public finally notices. LondonLeedsFan Maybe in the US - UK won't be getting call features as far as I understand. Lars Jeppesen Neither will Europe or other places. xyz No worries since none of these will be available outside the US so everyone else will stick with the competition. Gfame103 Just enable the got dam calling feature already! XerBlade "It may be a hacky workaround, but at least it gives us an out that doesn't require whispering into a phone mic or walking over to the Home unit to hit a mute button." If this is truly what that's about, seriously, as I keep bringing up pretty much every time I see such extremes being brought up as necessities, wouldn't it be easier than any of those incredibly stupid solutions to just hit the button on your phone instead of using the hotword in the first place? tu3218 Bring it on! Good_Ole_Pinocchio I want new Hardware Google. Software is almost fully baked. I shall wait. F4LL0U7 So this stuff is great, but I'm having some experience-breaking issues on my Nexus 5X and G Watch R. 1. Reminders just don't show up as notifications at all, and automatically get dismissed. This makes them completely useless as reminders! 2. I enter *every* appointment in Google Calendar, and some of them have addresses. This should (and used to) make a very handy "time to leave" card and notification show up when I needed it. Currently, the card and notification do show up, but then get automatically dismissed. When they disappear, that event no longer shows up in my agenda in my Google feed. If it weren't for Google Calendar reminders, I'd completely miss my appointments. Both of these issues have plagued me for months, and have not been fixed even if I do a factory reset. Anyone else experiencing this? Any suggestions? Good_Ole_Pinocchio I haven't experienced those issues personally. You may get a lot more responses over at reddit though. surethom All. I want is a graphical equaliser to reduce the ridiculously high base. Good_Ole_Pinocchio What you need is new hardware from Google. reggjoo Are you rooted? If so, Magisk has many audio mods that will give you the control your looking for(Dolby atmos is one example). If not, maybe the playstore has something, even though they seem to not integrate seamlessly with the system as much. obk88 is using the free spotify account available yet? JD That will never happen Spencer Actually... http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/17/google-home-now-supports-spotify-even-free-accounts-plus-soundcloud-deezer/ Grey When will my phone beep when I say Okay Google again? This is the single most head-scratching, bizarre, insane decision Google has ever made. Does anyone else's Okay Google's on their phone beep them anymore? Makes that sound? Mine make it over bluetooth but not in person. I DON'T GET IT. How do I get this feature back?? It's essential. Willie Chalmers III It makes the noise if it's on Bluetooth. I miss the sound, but I suppose Google considered the fact that if you're asking the assistant something on your phone, you can visually see if it's responding, so only tactile response, a vibration, is necessary There's also the possibility that the noise made Google Assistant feel less conversational and more like a robot, which isn't what Google desires. Grey I think the less conversational thing is what they were going for, but there's tons of problems. For one, it isn't always listening. I have spoken to the phone trying to be conversational and it's just not listening anymore. And two, I'm not looking at my phone!!! That's the point of voice commands!! reggjoo Those settings are not there with the new updates(at least the last two). If anybody can find the "in apps" button, more power to you. I lost the voice function, except in the Google app, after I updated that. Tried all the "solutions" that I could possibly find, and scoured every post. By accident, I was messing around with Google +, and did something, some settings came up, clicked on some, and "viola" everything came back! In apps was back, the beep was back, just like before their update. Do I want to update it again? Not really. akshay7394 It beeps when you trigger it via 'Ok Google', doesn't beep if triggered through the home button long-press gesture. Grey I only use Ok Google. Doesn't beep. akshay7394 Strange; are you referring to Assistant or the older version ? beeps for me :s Total Insecurity On my Google Pixel XL it still beeps like a champ. reggjoo Try to find the solution thru google+, you wouldn't expect any settings to be there for the assistant, but something's there, but I can't remember what I did, and it was by accident. Sina ina Anyone having problem with ok google detection when screen is off ( while chaging ) with this version ? mine is broken right now reggjoo If that's all that's wrong, feel lucky, the update of Google app broke my voice, it only worked in the Google app, after I pressed the home button. Almost 6 hours after I updated it, it went to that state. First it's actions started slowing down, then in any app died, then it stopped launching from the launcher(even though my launcher has OK Google detection built in). After clearing cache, data, uninstalling to previous versions, updating, messing with activity settings, enabling permissions with apps2sd pro, I fixed it by accident. I went to Google +, found some settings in there(wasn't looking for anything about the assistant). From the settings in the app, other settings about the assistant started popping up. Enabled them, and everything started working again, except screen off. I figure I could get that to work again too, but ya gotta know when to say when. I turned off automatic updates, used titanium backup to detach it from the playstore, but Google, sometimes gets around that, and updates anyway, so my fingers are crossed now. I want to enjoy my phone, for a little while, before they screw it up again. Behace When deciding which device to answer from, why can't assistant decide which decides can handle the request then figure out which device recorded the request at the highest decibel? It would be a rather crude way of deciding which device to answer with but it could work, no? Fruity101079 Still no Google Assistant on Nexus devices, while my language is supported... reggjoo What I worry about is breaking what setup I already have. Last few updates broke my voice function (what happened to "from any app button"?) It took almost a month to figure how to get that function back. Eventually, through g+, after trying all the help solutions, that didn't work at all, I figured it out, but I can't remember how now. I don't want to go thru that again. I'm turning off automatic updates, just to protect my setup, even though Google apps always finds a way. I'll shy away from this one, til I hear from various forums about stability problems with setups and older devices. Ryan How about recognizing the Home is handling the request and turning my screen back off? My phone just sits there with the screen on. JG it looks like Google is still working working out the best way to handle multiple always-listening devices Having to press a "Answer here" button, IMHO, kind of defeats the purpose of having hands free, always listening devices. Instead, I think Google should set customized wake up triggers for each device. Right now we have "OK Google" and "Hey Google" trigger phrases. The Google Home and Android Auto could be set to only reply to "Hey Google" while the phone could be set to reply to just "OK Google" triggers. Then I could just say "OK Google, send a text to Mark, let him know I'll be 10min late" and know my phone is going to handle it rather than my Home yelling at me that it still can't send messages. Or maybe even go a step farther. Motorola has had the ability to set personalized trigger phrases for their Moto X line for some years now (mine woke to "Hello Moto X"). I'm sure Google should be able to figure out a means to allow each of my devices to have their own specific wake up trigger. That might also help cut down on false triggers in multi-Home houses. "Hey Bedroom Home, what time is it" won't accidentally trigger both Bedroom Home and Living Room Home. reggjoo I said almost the same thing a while ago, as far as the trigger word goes. Why Google, still holds onto "OK Google" just to use voice, is beyond me. Some will say that changing it will mess with their servers, but no, how could it, all the info they collect on you, your habits, etc.. I'm sure there's enough space in there for personalized voice commands. Your idea is good. xyz US only? Lame. When is Google going to bring independence day to the rest of the world? JG There's actually nothing special to say here – Google just added a new line for activities scheduled for July 4th, which is Independence Day in the United States. I'm curious as to this string... Is Google going to display my personal information (from Calendar et al) reminding me I need to take potato salad to Aunt Em's pool party... Or will it display information about near by activities, like when my local municipality's fire works display is scheduled... Or is Google going to "host" their own special Independence Day activities? And will other holidays get similar treatment in the future? Blake Sinnett So I've been thinking ever since this was posted. What if you could connect Duo for audio calls? It would certainly improve quality. They mention "phone services" but that could be Duo, Skype, etc. What if they made it possible for apps to connect to the Google Home calling feature? Probably not, but it would be neat if that happened.

Or maybe your kitchen. Google Home, the smart speaker with Google Assistant built in, becomes officially available and supported in Canada on June 26, for $179. The speaker works in Canada now, of course, but not completely. Later this month, though, you'll be able to talk to the speaker in English or French, and have it play music, or operate a number of home automation devices that are supported. You can change the temperature, turn lights on and off, play music, have a recipe read to you, and even set alarms and notifications. This week, Apple gave notice that it was entering the arena with the HomePod. Intended to be Apple's extension into your home, and working with your iPhone and iPad, the device brings Siri's voice-activation features to home automation. Priced at US$349, the HomePod will be released in the U.S., UK, and Australia in December. Canadian pricing and availabilty were not detailed. Apple is situating HomePod as more of a speaker system with voice-activiation features than a home AI. Available in white or "space grey", the device has seven tweeters, a four-inch woofer, and will work with Apple Music, the company's streaming music service. The speaker will reportedly automatically sense where it is in the room and adjust its acoustics accordingly, and if there are two in a room they will automatically balance. The third combatant in this fracas will be the Amazon Echo. It, too, operates in Canada, but only partially. Alexa, Amazon's digital assistant, is not officially supported north of the 49th. But with Apple and Google getting ready for a fight, I can't imagine Amazon is going to wait too long to join in the fun.

Voters have asked the search engine the important questions leading up to the General Election, with the most popular query “who should I vote for?” AP:Associated Press 7 Theresa May is hoping to retain her position as Prime Minister Getty Images 7 Jeremy Corbyn believes his party will offer Brits an alternative future – but people are interested in whether he is a vegan Google Trends 7 The search terms in the first week of June showed an interest in hung parliament Other popular auto-fill searches have seen suggested questions including “is Theresa May related to Brian May?”, the famed Queen guitarist, as well as “is Jeremy Corbyn a vegan?” Questions including “Is Nicola Sturgeon a Celtic fan?” were also suggested to those curious Googlers ahead of the election. The search terms were revealed when Google released the top searched terms and questions relating to the UK election in the past seven days. Getty Images 7 Voters have been curious to know if musician Brian May of Queen is related to Theresa May Alamy 7 Voters have turned to Google to find out who they should vote for in the 2017 election Google Trends 7 UK search interest in five most searched parties shows 50 per cent of political searches were about the Labour party Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn casts his General Election vote in north London Other timely suggestions from Google include "Theresa May Shoes". But if the UK search interest in the parties is anything to go by, the Labour party has been involved in half of the questions asked of Google, while the Conservative party has been included in 22 per cent. Scott Donnelly, Search Engine Marketing Strategist at DigitasLBi, wrote in a blog about the search trends, saying: "Across the whole of the UK then, it’s noticeable just how much interest is being drummed up by Labour. "In each country, while Labour may not be leading in the polls, it is certainly provoking the most significant number of searches. Exactly how this translates into votes, we’ll have to wait and see." He further noted that 13.9 per cent of those who visited the Conservative website then went onto Labour's, while 17.8 per cent of Labour site visitors went onto the Conservatives.

But while the search terms are interesting, Mr Donnelly said it was difficult to come to a conclusion of who would win the 2017 election. The strategist wrote: "With the polls currently saying Conservative and search suggesting Labour, who knows what the result will be. Google usually has the answers, but this is one answer it can’t know for sure. "We can however confirm the answer to the other burning question on everybody’s lips – Theresa May is NOT related to Brian May."

The number of people searching for information about how to register to vote peaked on April 18, the day the Prime Minister said she was seeking a general election. If you're a betting man or woman, have a look at the odds. Sun Bets have had the Conservatives as the clear favourites of winning an overall majority throughout the campaign although their advantage had reduced with odds resting on 1/5. Labour is trailing far behind the Tories but Jeremy Corbyn’s party has been boosted by recent polls as election day draws near. We pay for your stories!

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS Google Assistant gets This Day in History, one of Alexa’s most popular voice apps Khari Johnson@kharijohnson June 8, 2017 1:40 PM Above: Google Home Image Credit: GE Appliances At Google I/O last month — just like Microsoft and Apple developer conferences — virtually every announcement was related to artificial intelligence or intelligent assistants. Some major changes were made to Google Assistant, including a new App Directory, the introduction of payments with voice apps, a Google Assistant app for iPhone, and the ability to access voice apps on devices like Android phones. Since then, more than 40 voice apps have been added that give users a series of new abilities, from a Prayer Pal to the introduction of one of the most popular voice apps to date. From History Channel, the This Day in History action gives detailed, lengthy descriptions of historical events for any day of the year and appears to draw on the same vast corpus of knowledge that drives an Alexa skill by the same name. Since its release in early 2017, This Day in History has become one of the most popular skills in the Alexa Skills Store, almost permanently a part of the Top Enabled skills category. Prayer Pal helps adherents of Islam observe Ramadan and mark times to pray based on location. Prayer Pal joins a host of religious voice apps that have been made available for Google Assistant, from Divine Song, an action that plays songs from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita, to YouVersion, a Bible-reading action with a narrator that can read scripture based on your mood. Chat with Sigmund is an action with a slight Germanic accent to mimic Sigmund Freud. Chat with Sigmund is modeled after Eliza, a therapist bot first made at MIT in the 1960s. In games, some basic classics are now available, like Truth or Dare and Classic Hangman. There’s also more interactive games for groups of people, like Absurd is the Word, Discovery Patterns, and Word Nerd. IoT controls continue to be a large part of Google Assistant app offerings, with actions to control motion sensors on the Alfred Camera or sprinklers on Blossom. For electric car owners, the EV Car action answers a range of questions like the charge status of the car and its location; it even lets you control the car temperature, honk the horn, or start charging. In the novelty category, realTalk dispenses Chuck Norris quotes, while Round of Applause is true to its title. If you’re looking for a challenge, there’s Squared Circle Wrestling Trivia and Geek Girl Rising Trivia Game. Among utilities, there’s Tipping Calculator, as well as Spanish Teacher and German Teacher created by the startup Magiclingua. Another impressive recent arrival is Mail Buddy. When linked to a Gmail account, Mailbot is able to read and sift through emails. Delay Repay was made to help people in the United Kingdom apply for compensation when their train is delayed. Since the launch of the Actions on Google platform last December, more than 300 actions have been listed on the Google Home app. VB Recommendations Microsoft releases new Windows 10 preview with a huge number of improvements SoftBank buys Alphabet’s robotics businesses Boston Dynamics and Schaft PC Gaming Weekly: Magic in the making at Cryptic and Perfect World
BUSINESS Technology Google parent's shareholders vote to withhold gender pay details Virginia Mayo / Associated Press Google headquarters in Brussels in 2010. Google headquarters in Brussels in 2010. (Virginia Mayo / Associated Press) Hamza ShabanThe Washington Post For the second year in a row, shareholders of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, voted down a proposal asking the tech giant to publish a report on possible pay disparities between its male and female employees. The vote comes at a time when the company is grappling with a federal lawsuit tied to this very issue and as the tech industry faces heightened scrutiny over compensation inequities, a lack of diversity, and dysfunctional work environments. Under the proposal, the company would measure and disclose how much its female employees make as a percentage of their male counterparts’ pay. The plan, put forward by Arjuna Capital, an investment firm, and others also called for the company to design a policy to tackle any gender pay disparity. “Gender pay disparity is not only one of the biggest social justice issues of our time, it poses a risk to companies' performance, brand, and investor returns,” said Natasha Lamb, Arjuna's director of shareholder engagement, at the shareholder meeting. “This issue is particularly salient to the technology industry, which struggles to attract, retain and move women into positions of leadership,” she said. The board of directors told shareholders that approving the proposal would not be in the best interest of the company or its investors, according to Alphabet's 2017 statement to stockholders. Management pointed to Google's existing diversity reports and internal evaluations as sufficient measures to ensure pay equity among its staff. “Our board of directors does not believe that the proposal would enhance Alphabet’s existing commitment to fostering a fair and inclusive culture,” read the statement. Like many of its peers in the tech industry, Google produces an annual report outlining the gender and ethnic makeup of its employees. A vast majority of Alphabet’s employees work for Google. But the report doesn’t outline gender pay disparities. Of the company's global employees, 69% are male and 31% are female, according to Google' 2016 diversity report, which captured data from the year prior. But it’s unclear how much women employees are paid relative to the men. Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have all reported on gender pay disparity at their companies, with each claiming a discrepancy near zero. Lamb described Alphabet as a laggard compared to its peers when it comes to transparency over gender pay. Alphabet declined to comment. Arjuna Capital’s push for Alphabet to release its gender pay information is part of a broader campaign to address enduring gender discrimination in the American workplace. Within Silicon Valley, which generally views itself as a meritocracy, calls for improving diversity have only grown louder as yearly employment reports continue to show leadership teams being dominated by men. The calls also come as accounts of workplace harassment continue to surface. In February, former Uber employee Susan Fowler published a blog post alleging episodes of sexual harassment that she said took place while she worked as an engineer at the company. Since her writing, Uber initiated several internal investigations to examine what Fowler and others described as a toxic work culture. Uber’s sexual harassment controversy is viewed by some not as an anomaly, but just the latest, prominent example of women facing discrimination at work in Silicon Valley. Google is currently facing a lawsuit from the Labor Department related to unfair gender pay. The Labor Department filed the lawsuit in January after the Mountain View, Calif., company refused to turn over compensation data as part of a “routine compliance evaluation,” according to a Labor Department statement released in the same month. Labor Department lawyers have accused Alphabet of underpaying women, finding evidence of “extreme” gender pay discrimination. Google has denied those accusations. In a hearing last month, Alphabet said that it couldn’t turn over internal wage data that the department requested because compiling it would cost too much — $100,000 — and require hundreds of hours of work, according to the Guardian. Alphabet is the third major tech company since 2016 to fall under Labor Department scrutiny. Palantir was accused of discriminating against Asian job applicants, and Oracle was sued for allegedly engaging in pay discrimination against women employees as well as Asian and black workers, according to the Guardian. At the shareholder meeting, Lamb also presented a shareholder proposal for Google to analyze its role in the spread of misleading and fabricated news stories, so-called fake news. With management’s blessing, that proposal failed. Another plan presented by NorthStars Asset Management would have given stockholders equal voting power. That was defeated as well.

Verizon is buying Yahoo in hopes of challenging Google and Facebook in the digital advertising market by combining ad technologies and user profiles from Yahoo and the AOL business it already owns. But Google and Facebook are so much better at this that itâll be tough for Verizon to do more than tread water. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) (Photo: AP) 23 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEW YORK – About 2,100 jobs are on the chopping block as Verizon prepares to combine Yahoo and AOL for a digital advertising offensive. Yahoo’s shareholders on Thursday approved the $4.5 billion sale of its key businesses to Verizon. The deal is expected to close by Tuesday. AOL and Yahoo will cut 15 percent of the 14,000 workers they now employ, or about 2,100 jobs, said a person familiar with the matter who requested not to be identified discussing the cuts. Verizon has a simple goal in buying Yahoo’s core business: It wants to challenge Google and Facebook in the huge and lucrative field of digital advertising. But Verizon faces its own challenge in doing so, given that it will be competing against a slew of other companies also looking to break in. Verizon wants to become a strong third choice for advertisers by adding Yahoo’s popular sites and billion users worldwide to its own media business, which includes AOL and Verizon’s home-grown go90 video service. It can place ads on those sites, and can also combine data from visitors to those sites with AOL’s ad technologies and sales teams, and possibly also personal data from Verizon mobile customers such as location and other information, in order to better target ads at individuals. Verizon has programs that use mobile-customer data for targeted ads and may combine that with data gathered by AOL and Yahoo. Verizon says customers can choose whether to participate. Yahoo and AOL are “positioned to do better together than apart,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. But he is setting the bar low. While Verizon talks of growth from the deal, Wieser said “not declining would be a success. Five years from now, if the combined entity were the same size as it is today, I would consider that to be successful.” Verizon sees online ads — particularly targeted ads — as a potential new source of growth as the wireless industry fights for U.S. users with lower prices and other discounts. Verizon has “essentially turned into a no-growth business,” said CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino. The ad business would be a “big deal” for Verizon if it goes well, he said. Tim Armstrong, the former Google executive who joined AOL as CEO in 2009, has for years wanted to combine AOL with the long-declining Yahoo. Although AOL has big-name properties such as HuffPost and Engadget, it hasn’t been as big of an online destination as Yahoo’s mail, finance, sports and other properties. The combined business, to be called Oath, will expand its news, sports, entertainment, finance and lifestyle coverage. Like everyone else, Oath will focus on video and mobile, where consumers increasingly spend their time online. Armstrong says he wants Oath properties to be a place consumers “come and visit every day” and predicts users growing to 2 billion from 1.3 billion by 2020, with annual revenue of $10 billion to $20 billion from roughly $7 billion today. Lowell McAdam, CEO of New York-based Verizon, teased last month that this could set the stage for a new streaming video service, competing with the slew of internet-TV services already out there. Verizon already has a free mobile video service, go90, that isn’t well known. Facebook and Google together draw about half the world’s spending on digital ads, and in the U.S., they’re even more dominant. They’re also where the majority of mobile-ad dollars go, eMarketer data show. The sway Facebook and Google hold for advertisers isn’t expected to change in the next few years. They had a head start on mobile. Yahoo has poured billions into acquisitions that have helped Yahoo make some leeway in mobile — but not enough. It’s gotten better at doing mobile ads, but it has had no major hit apps. Still, AOL and Yahoo together provide a much-smaller No. 3 in the U.S. for advertisers looking to reach lots of people. But even if Verizon’s goal is to just be happy at No. 3, there are several much smaller players that also draw advertisers. Snapchat is a niche hit with young people. Amazon has an under-the-radar ad business that supports its e-commerce dominance. Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, is expected to grow its piece of the ad pie; Microsoft will be just behind the combined AOL-Yahoo in the U.S. once the deal closes. Twitter, although it’s sorting out its ad business, is a significant smaller player. Globally, several Chinese companies also rake in ad dollars. And the combined company will also have to compete for people’s attention, and not just with other services that rely on ad dollars to survive. Popular sites like Amazon or Netflix also suck up time spent online, said eMarketer analyst Martin Utreras. “They’ve acquired these two dinosaurs and you kind of wonder, can they be successful?” Zino said. That will depend on Verizon being able to convince marketers that they know more about consumers than anyone else, he said.

Here's what you need to know about smart speakers Posted: Thursday, June 8, 2017 4:23 PM EDT Updated: Thursday, June 8, 2017 4:25 PM EDT Apple unveiled HomePod, a new 7-inch tall speaker for playing music, checking the news and controlling other connected devices in the home. By Heather Kelly SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) -- Apple is getting into the smart speaker market with the HomePod, the company's first entirely new product in three years. It's a relatively young hardware category made popular by the Amazon Echo. Now, more tech companies are rushing out their own versions of the device. You've probably heard about talking speakers, but perhaps you've wondered how they work and what they mean for your privacy. Here's everything you need to know about tech's hottest new gadgets. What is a smart speaker? A smart speaker is a small Wi-Fi connected speaker controlled with voice commands. To use the hands-free device, you speak a trigger phrase - "Hey Siri," "OK Google," "Alexa" - and then ask a question such as "what's the weather?" or make a request like "order a Lyft." The speakers are powered by smart assistants like Siri and Alexa that talk back. What is it used for? A smart speaker is primarily used to stream music and news, set timers and reminders, manage shopping lists, and control connected-home devices like lights or thermostats. Amazon recently added message and call options, so the speakers will likely be used even more for communication in the future. The Echo is handy for ordering things from Amazon Prime, but it struggles with answering basic knowledge questions. Meanwhile, the Google Home, unsurprisingly, is great for Googling things. Who makes them? Amazon created the smart speaker market in 2014 with the release of the Echo. Google followed in 2016 with Google Home, and Microsoft is currently working with Harman Kardon on the Invoke smart speaker, which uses voice-assistant Cortana. In early June, Apple announced the HomePod, but it won't be available until December. Third-party devices such as Lenovo's Smart Assistant also use Amazon's Alexa assistant. As of now, most smart speakers plug into a wall, so they're not portable. Amazon's smaller, battery-operated Tap device is designed to play on the go. However, you have to push a button to start Alexa voice conversations. Here's a look at the options available now or coming this year: Amazon Echo ($180); Echo Dot ($50), which connects to bigger speakers; the portable Echo Tap ($130); and Echo Show ($230), a speaker with a touchscreen and camera launching June 28 Google Home ($129) Apple HomePod ($329), which debuts in December Harman Kardon Invoke with Cortana, slated for a 2017 year-end launch. No pricing announced. What about sound quality? The Amazon Echo and Google Home are adequate speakers for the price point, but music lovers can connect them to Bluetooth speakers for better sound. The Echo Dot also attaches to existing speaker systems over Bluetooth or with an audio cable. Apple is marketing the HomePod as a much higher quality speaker -- and it is. When tested against Sonos speakers and the Amazon Echo, the sound was superior. Using its microphones to measure the size of a room, the HomePod "senses" its location and adjusts the sound accordingly. What services and apps do they work with? Each product is a way for a company to sell its own services, like Apple Music, Amazon Prime and Google Play. But the ability to work with third-parties is part of what makes them most useful. The Echo can play music from popular music services like Spotify, Pandora, TuneIn and iHeart Radio. It's currently the leader in this area with more than 10,000 third-party voice apps called "skills." Although most of these skills aren't useful, it's possible to order a pizza or flowers, get wine recommendations or check your bank account balance. Google has fewer third-party integrations and said it plans to add more to its platform soon. It's unclear if the HomePod will work with third-party services right away. Siri can do the usual smart assistant tasks, but the device's music commands are designed specifically to work with a $10 monthly Apple Music subscription. Without one, users can only ask Siri to play podcasts or BeatsOne radio. To listen to music from a library or any other services, you'll need to stream them via Airplay from an iPhone or iPad. What are the privacy concerns? Smart speakers have powerful microphones that are always listening. This can be an unsettling concept for people worried about privacy, but companies say they're not recording when not in use. Once the devices hear a wake word or phrase, they start recording and send your voice to the cloud to complete the request. Even though Apple, Amazon and Google encrypt the data, recordings are saved. In fact, police recently tried to get an Echo's recordings as evidence in a recent murder trial. The Home and Echo also include mute buttons. Apple did not say if or how its speaker could be muted. Who is it for? Anyone who is busy cooking, holding kids or doing other tasks at home will benefit from a hands-free computer. Because the devices understand your natural way of speaking, smart speakers are less complicated to operate than other gadgets, making it an easy-to-use tool for seniors. The list of tasks you can do with just voice is growing across all of these devices. The industry is betting this will be the future of how we interact with computers. Their common inspiration for what's ahead is Star Trek's omnipresent, voice-activated assistant "Computer," which could do everything from calculating a starship's trajectory to making a nice cup of tea.

(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) Those of us of a certain age will remember classes as kids that involved going down to the school library and learning how to use the card catalogue to look up information. Or, if the question was straightforward enough, how to use the encyclopedia to figure out, say, how big sea urchins could get. Nowadays, though, we don’t have to go to the library, much less stand up. We can simply grab our phones and ask Google. Or not even that: We can yell at little Internet-connected speakers in our houses and demand answers to whatever questions pop into our minds. As former FBI director James B. Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, that’s what people across the United States did. They asked Google all sorts of things about the hearing, no doubt, but nothing more frequently than the following 10 questions. We have taken it upon ourselves to answer them. Questions about Comey 1. How tall is James Comey? Comey is 6-8. How tall is that? It’s very tall. The average American man is 5’9″, almost a foot shorter than Comey. Or, put in more accessible terms, Comey is the same height as LeBron James. It is not known whether Comey can dunk. 2. Who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee? The Washington Post actually wrote about this. The members of the committee are: Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) Vice Chairman Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) James E. Risch (R-Idaho) Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) James Lankford (R-Okla.) Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) John Cornyn (R-Tex.) Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) Joe Manchin III (D-W.V.) Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) Angus King (I-Maine) There are also ex officio members who are allowed to ask questions. They include John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.), each of whom asked Comey questions. If you need to know who any of those other people are, consult an encyclopedia. 3. Why is Comey testifying? Comey volunteered to testify to answer questions about the circumstances behind his firing by President Trump a month ago. Since that incident, a number of reports emerged about conversations between Trump and Comey before the termination that suggested inappropriate behavior by the president. In agreeing to testify about those reports, Comey was careful not to step on the separate investigation being led by former FBI director Robert Mueller, now the Department of Justice’s special counsel. 4. Why was Comey fired? It depends on who you ask, and when. If you’d asked Trump’s team the night of the firing, he was fired at the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, because of Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. If you asked Trump later that week — as NBC’s Lester Holt did — he would say that he was thinking about the investigation into Russia. If you asked Comey on Thursday — which Feinstein did — he would say he takes Trump at his word and that it was because of that investigation. 5. Who is questioning Comey right now? No one. The hearing ended a few hours ago. Questions about Trump 1. Is Trump under investigation? We don’t actually know. We know that when Comey was fired, Trump was not under investigation, though Comey didn’t want to say that publicly because it would trigger the need to update the public if that changed. But in the intervening month, it’s possible that Trump has come under direct investigation. We do have reports that Trump’s allies, both from the campaign and his administration, are subjects of direct investigation. They include his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. 2. In which areas does Trump want to increase the budget? Sort of off-topic, but why not. Trump’s proposed budget (which is very unlikely to ever become law) included massive cuts to most agencies. Among those where he’d like to see more spending are defense, infrastructure and programs for veterans and parents. 3. Is Trump live tweeting now? He is not! Nor was he during the hearing. There was some question whether Trump would be able to restrain his impulse to weigh in on what he was seeing (and it’s fairly certain that he did see most of the testimony as it was presented). Apparently, he was. It’s important to note just how remarkable that is. This is also the 140th day of Trump’s administration, making it a much more significant day on which to tweet.* But Trump hasn’t tweeted once Thursday. Yet. 4. What is Trump saying now? We don’t know. He did give a speech Thursday afternoon, during which he avoided the subject of Comey. His personal attorney issued a statement in response to Comey. It had some problems. 5. How popular is Trump? Not very. Trump is less popular at this point in his presidency than any other president in Gallup polling history. Only 37 percent of Americans approve of the job he’s doing, as of Thursday. Barack Obama’s all-time low was 38 percent. More concerning for Trump is that there is some indication that the strength of support in his base is also fading. Trump relies on and caters to that base. If it’s wavering, that is a bad sign. That’s all we got. Now that we’ve obviated the need for you to even look up the answers to those most popular questions, here’s a Google search we would like to recommend. * The maximum number of characters in a tweet is 140. That’s the joke I was making.

The Developer Preview 3 also marks a revised version of Android Studio and coupled with new system images, developers should have almost everything they need to make their apps compatible with Android O. The Mountain View, California-based tech giant noted that it’s also planning to debut Android O Developer Preview 4 next month, though related APIs will remain unchanged and that particular build will only bring “near-final system images.” Making one’s app compatible with Android O generally isn’t a daunting task, the Alphabet-owned company claims, urging developers to enroll in the Android Beta Program with a supported device, update it to the latest Developer Preview of the OS, and make any changes they deem necessary after testing their software. Once the optimization process has been completed, Google recommends developers to instantly publish the revised versions of their products on the Google Play Store and not change their platform targeting. Depending on individual developers and their willingness to take advantage of new Android O features like Adaptive Icons and Notification Channels, the time required for the actual optimization process may vary. Click on the button below to join the Android O Beta Program or refer to the source link beneath this writing to find out more about making apps compatible with the upcoming build of the OS. Android O is scheduled to hit the stable channel in the coming months and will initially debut on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as compatible Nexus devices. According to recent reports, the first stable build of the OS may roll out as early as August and will be distributed to more devices in months following that debut, with the expanded availability of the software depending on individual original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and their ability to optimize it for their needs in a swift manner. Regarding devices that are set to ship with Android O, LG Electronics was the first company to release a smartphone running Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box with its LG V20 that hit the market last October and as the LG V30 is expected to be launched around the same period this year, the Seoul-based firm may manage to repeat that achievement with the latest major iteration of Android.

Google Trends has released its list of most misspelled words based on the number of times Canadians typed “how to spell” in Google search, and broke it down by province and territory. From altar to precious to supercalifragilisticexpilidocious, these are just some of the words we seem to be struggling with. Google Canada’s head of communications, Nicole Bell, told CTV News Channel that they noticed a trend – a lot of the words searched had slightly different spelling in Canada than in the United States or had letters that were easily mixed up. Here in Ontario, we struggle with the word “colour,” to add the ‘u’ or not, that is the question. We decided to put the list to the spelling test in Waterloo Region and hit the streets. What we found would have us writing home without consulting Google or a dictionary. There were no qualms spelling out “colour” and a surprising amount of people knew how to spell “supercalifragilisticexpilidocious.” The slip ups? There was a bit of trouble with “facetious” and “pneumonia.” Without being too facetious, it appears our region is well disciplinedwhen it comes to spelling. Google Trends also released a breakdown south of the border and among the most searched words in the United Sates, “tomorrow” makes the list, twice. “Wisconsin” was the most searched word, in Wisconsin.

Toggle navigation 34th Street Magazine The Daily Pennsylvanian About UTB Advertise 34th Street Magazine The Daily Pennsylvanian The Buzz About UTB Advertise About Under The Button, Penn's humor and satire blog. Penn, unbuttoned. Satire  Published 10 hours ago Rising Junior Going Through Google Form Withdrawal By David Akst Photo by Amit Agarwal / CC 2.0 "It's been a month, maybe longer," rising Wharton junior Steven Zhu told us on Wednesday. "This has been the hardest experience of my life." Zhu is just one of many students going through near-unimaginable discomfort, both physical and mental, in the transition from school to summer. It isn't his friends, nor the cockroaches of West Philadelphia, that Zhu and many others are missing. Instead, it is the humble Google Form. "At school, they're everywhere. You can't log onto Facebook or check your email without seeing a handful of Google Forms to fill out," Zhu lamented. "It's so easy to access Google Forms... you get used to it. Your body adjusts. You start to need more and more Google Forms to feel like a functional adult and a contributing member of the Penn community. All of a sudden you leave for the summer and it's cold turkey, zero Google Forms. In the real world you can't find them on every alley and street corner the way you can at Penn." We spoke to Dr. Amy Blise, a professor specializing in addiction at the Perelman School of Medicine, to find out whether or not students can truly become dependent or addicted to Google Forms. "It's possible, I suppose," Blise said. "Just about anything can be addictive. If students like this one are taking high numbers of Google Forms each week, especially while in a stressful environment like Penn, it's conceivable that they could become addicted to the action of filling out these surveys." Although she acknowledged the potential for addiction in regards to Google Forms, Blise also noted that there are many substances that pose far more danger to the mental and physical wellbeing of the user than do Google Forms.  "Have you seen that episode of My Strange Addiction where the woman is addicted to drinking paint?" Looking at Zhu, though, the physical toll is obvious. Zhu, clearly in the throes of withdrawal, is sweaty and wan. His pallid skin suggests not just exhaustion but fragility, as if his inability to fill out Google Forms has weakened him to the point that he could be broken by a stiff breeze or a gentle handshake. Blise says that quitting something "cold turkey" usually doesn't take this long, and that, while she hasn't studied the effects of completing Google Forms directly, the situation may imply some unknown qualities of Google Forms which make them particularly hard to quit. In the living room of Zhu's home in the northern section of Westchester, his parents told us that they're looking into rehab, some program where Zhu might be given limited access to a decreasing number of Google Forms each week, to wean him off. He's started at 14 Google Forms per day, and after a month of treatment, he's already down to 11. "It's hard, though. Most established rehabilitation centers don't have programs that deal with Google Form addiction, yet," they said.  Tweet All comments eligible for publication in Daily Pennsylvanian, Inc. publications.

Here’s what you need to know about smart speakers Apple’s HomePod is coming. Here’s what you need to know about smart speakers Posted on Thursday, June 8, 2017 by CNN in Business News Apple is getting into the smart speaker market with the HomePod, the company’s first entirely new product in three years. It’s a relatively young hardware category made popular by the Amazon Echo. Now, more tech companies are rushing out their own versions of the device. You’ve probably heard about talking speakers, but perhaps you’ve wondered how they work and what they mean for your privacy. Here’s everything you need to know about tech’s hottest new gadgets. What is a smart speaker? A smart speaker is a small Wi-Fi connected speaker controlled with voice commands. To use the hands-free device, you speak a trigger phrase — “Hey Siri,” “OK Google,” “Alexa” — and then ask a question such as “what’s the weather?” or make a request like “order a Lyft.” The speakers are powered by smart assistants like Siri and Alexa that talk back. What is it used for? A smart speaker is primarily used to stream music and news, set timers and reminders, manage shopping lists, and control connected-home devices like lights or thermostats. Amazon recently added message and call options, so the speakers will likely be used even more for communication in the future. The Echo is handy for ordering things from Amazon Prime, but it struggles with answering basic knowledge questions. Meanwhile, the Google Home, unsurprisingly, is great for Googling things. Who makes them? Amazon created the smart speaker market in 2014 with the release of the Echo. Google followed in 2016 with Google Home, and Microsoft is currently working with Harman Kardon on the Invoke smart speaker, which uses voice-assistant Cortana. In early June, Apple announced the HomePod, but it won’t be available until December. Third-party devices such as Lenovo’s Smart Assistant also use Amazon’s Alexa assistant. As of now, most smart speakers plug into a wall, so they’re not portable. Amazon’s smaller, battery-operated Tap device is designed to play on the go. However, you have to push a button to start Alexa voice conversations. Here’s a look at the options available now or coming this year: Amazon Echo ($180); Echo Dot ($50), which connects to bigger speakers; the portable Echo Tap ($130); and Echo Show ($230), a speaker with a touchscreen and camera launching June 28 Google Home ($129) Apple HomePod ($329), which debuts in December Harman Kardon Invoke with Cortana, slated for a 2017 year-end launch. No pricing announced. What about sound quality? The Amazon Echo and Google Home are adequate speakers for the price point, but music lovers can connect them to Bluetooth speakers for better sound. The Echo Dot also attaches to existing speaker systems over Bluetooth or with an audio cable. Apple is marketing the HomePod as a much higher quality speaker — and it is. When tested against Sonos speakers and the Amazon Echo, the sound was superior. Using its microphones to measure the size of a room, the HomePod “senses” its location and adjusts the sound accordingly. What services and apps do they work with? Each product is a way for a company to sell its own services, like Apple Music, Amazon Prime and Google Play. But the ability to work with third-parties is part of what makes them most useful. The Echo can play music from popular music services like Spotify, Pandora, TuneIn and iHeart Radio. It’s currently the leader in this area with more than 10,000 third-party voice apps called “skills.” Although most of these skills aren’t useful, it’s possible to order a pizza or flowers, get wine recommendations or check your bank account balance. Google has fewer third-party integrations and said it plans to add more to its platform soon. It’s unclear if the HomePod will work with third-party services right away. Siri can do the usual smart assistant tasks, but the device’s music commands are designed specifically to work with a $10 monthly Apple Music subscription. Without one, users can only ask Siri to play podcasts or BeatsOne radio. To listen to music from a library or any other services, you’ll need to stream them via Airplay from an iPhone or iPad. What are the privacy concerns? Smart speakers have powerful microphones that are always listening. This can be an unsettling concept for people worried about privacy, but companies say they’re not recording when not in use. Once the devices hear a wake word or phrase, they start recording and send your voice to the cloud to complete the request. Even though Apple, Amazon and Google encrypt the data, recordings are saved. In fact, police recently tried to get an Echo’s recordings as evidence in a recent murder trial. The Home and Echo also include mute buttons. Apple did not say if or how its speaker could be muted. Who is it for? Anyone who is busy cooking, holding kids or doing other tasks at home will benefit from a hands-free computer. Because the devices understand your natural way of speaking, smart speakers are less complicated to operate than other gadgets, making it an easy-to-use tool for seniors. The list of tasks you can do with just voice is growing across all of these devices. The industry is betting this will be the future of how we interact with computers. Their common inspiration for what’s ahead is Star Trek’s omnipresent, voice-activated assistant “Computer,” which could do everything from calculating a starship’s trajectory to making a nice cup of tea.

Google News Lab and the World Bank are working with Code For Africa to empower journalists in Africa by giving them the necessary support to better understand the Web and how to use the tools available to them online. The Code For Africa Digital Journalism initiative will take place over the next 9 months (to February 2018) and see 6 000 journalists trained in 12 major African cities – Abuja, Lagos, Nairobi, Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban, Casablanca, Dakar, Freetown, Dar es Salaam, Kampala, and Yaounde. Code For Africa is a data journalism and civic technology initiative operating across Africa that trains and supports journalists and civic activists to better understand and use web tools for news reporting and storytelling. Training will take place in three formats. Beginning June 15, in-person training sessions will be held in the cities mentioned above. In each city, we will conduct training in 3 newsrooms and training will be held twice a month for the duration of the initiative. Beginning August, a massive open online course (MOOC) will be made freely available online, covering a range of web concepts and practices for digital journalists. Google  will also hold monthly study group meetups in collaboration with Hacks/Hackers to provide more focused, in-person instruction. Monthly meetings will take place in Cameroon, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. Commenting on the initiative, Daniel Sieberg, Head of Training & Development at Google News Lab said: “The web and digital tools present an interesting array of options for journalists, but learning how to use these tools can be a daunting task for many media people. While the global news industry faces a knowledge challenge with regards to digital tools, Africa, by virtue of its non-digital education systems, faces even greater odds in the battle for digital integration in news and storytelling. In Nigeria for instance, only a few of the journalism institutions offer training programs that focus on Web tools, and many top news organisations lose out on stories due to their inability to utilise newer and more engaging digital techniques.” In 2016, Google announced its commitment to train one million African youth within one year to help them create and find jobs via the Web. “With the Digital Journalism initiative we want to contribute to the growth of Africa’s news and media ecosystem by training present and future practitioners on how to employ existing tools to tell stories, and support them to create locally-relevant tools that will reshape how Africans consume news,” he added.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | June 8, 2017 -- 19:09 GMT (12:09 PDT) | Topic: Mobile OS Google on Thursday released the third developer preview of Android O, which comes with the final Android O APIs, the latest system images and an update to Android Studio. The latest preview update includes the final API level 26 and "hundreds of bugfixes and optimizations," Google said. The final API 26 SDK is available with the SDK Manager in Android Studio, and Android Support Library 26.0.0 beta 2 from Google's Maven repository. With these tools, Google said, developers have "everything you need to develop and test your apps with the official Android O APIs." Google made the mobile operating system available in beta last month at its I/O developer conference, after releasing the alpha version of the Android O developer preview in March. There will be one more preview update in July, and the consumer release will come "later in the summer," Google said Thursday. Android O's new features include notification channels and dots to drive user engagement in apps, a picture-in-picture feature that can keep one app onscreen while users are multitasking, and autofill.

Google News Lab and the World Bank according to a press release are working with Code For Africa to empower journalists in Africa by giving them the necessary support to better understand the Web and how to use the tools available to them online. The Code For Africa Digital Journalism initiative will take place over the next 9 months (to February 2018) and see 6 000 journalists trained in 12 major African cities – Abuja, Lagos, Nairobi, Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban, Casablanca, Dakar, Freetown, Dar es Salaam, Kampala, and Yaounde. Code For Africa is a data journalism and civic technology initiative operating across Africa that trains and supports journalists and civic activists to better understand and use web tools for news reporting and storytelling. Training will take place in three formats. Beginning June 15, in-person training sessions will be held in the cities mentioned above. In each city, we will conduct training in 3 newsrooms and training will be held twice a month for the duration of the initiative. Beginning August, a massive open online course (MOOC) will be made freely available online, covering a range of web concepts and practices for digital journalists. Also there will be monthly study group meetings in collaboration with Hacks/Hackers to provide more focused, in-person instruction. Monthly meetings will take place in Cameroon, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. Commenting on the initiative, Daniel Sieberg, Head of Training & Development at Google News Lab said: “The web and digital tools present an interesting array of options for journalists, but learning how to use these tools can be a daunting task for many media people. While the global news industry faces a knowledge challenge with regards to digital tools, Africa, by virtue of its non-digital education systems, faces even greater odds in the battle for digital integration in news and storytelling. In Nigeria for instance, only a few of the journalism institutions offer training programs that focus on Web tools, and many top news organisations lose out on stories due to their inability to utilise newer and more engaging digital techniques.” In 2016, Google announced its commitment to train one million African youth within one year to help them create and find jobs via the Web. “With the Digital Journalism initiative we want to contribute to the growth of Africa’s news and media ecosystem by training present and future practitioners on how to employ existing tools to tell stories, and support them to create locally-relevant tools that will reshape how Africans consume news,” he added.

Then last month during the Google IO developer conference, AODP2 got out - and this was the first preview build to also be available through the Android Beta program. Today AODP3 has been released. This comes with the final O APIs, so third party developers can pretty much start working on finalizing their apps for the next iteration of Android. Hundreds of bug fixes and optimizations are included in the latest AODP too. Like previous releases, it can be installed only on the Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, LG Nexus 5X, Huawei Nexus 6P, and Asus Nexus Player. If you have a device enrolled in the Android Beta program you'll get an update to the new build soon. Otherwise, if you have a supported device you can jump straight to AODP3 by enrolling it at this website. You can also flash a factory image with the new software, or sideload an OTA zip if you can't wait for the update notification. A final AODP will be coming in July, ahead of the rumored August release of the finalized Android O build for the aforementioned devices. With AODP3, Google has confirmed that Android O is Android 8.0.0, and not 7.2 or 7.5. The proof is in the image you can see above, displaying the About section of Settings on a handset with AODP3 installed.

Fortune Insiders Search Search Climate ChangeRichard Branson Calls President Trump ‘Naive’ For Leaving the Paris Climate Agreement United KingdomU.K. Election Deals Theresa May a Crushing Blow, Blurring Brexit Talks United KingdomSterling Drops as Theresa May Falls Short of Majority in U.K. Election EntrepreneurHere’s Where Most Startups Fail Theresa May, U.K. prime minister, leaves number 10 Downing Street to make a statement on the terror attack in London, U.K., on Sunday, June 4, 2017. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images Commentary UK Election Theresa May Can’t Just Blame the Internet for Terrorism Shontavia Johnson Jun 08, 2017 In the wake of recent terrorist attacks in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Theresa May publicly criticized “the Internet” and the “big companies that provide Internet-based services” as providing a safe space for terrorist ideologies to spread. She also called on democratic governments to “regulate cyberspace” by presumably passing laws to hold these companies accountable for communications spread through their services. May did not, however, specifically identify the spaces or companies she views as problematic. While these kinds of all-encompassing, non-specific statements may be politically effective in the lead-up to this week's general election in the UK, any serious attempts to address the spread of terrorism deserves significantly more nuance. Anything less is harmful to global discourse on such matters. May’s stern but vague admonition of “the Internet” ignores the sheer magnitude of it. The size of the world wide web, which is the primary way most users connect to the Internet, is enormous. Statistics indicate that there are more than 1 billion active websites online. Laying blame for the spread of terrorist ideologies on the entire Internet inappropriately simplifies the medium and its vast array of uses. Treating the Internet as a single, unitary space could cause significant issues revolving around data, privacy, and safety in general. Related EntrepreneurHere’s Where Most Startups Fail Entrepreneur Here’s Where Most Startups Fail In addition, calling out “big companies that provide Internet-based services” does not provide enough context to identify where terrorist ideologies are being spread or what, if anything, can be done about these spaces. There are a vast array of companies that offer Internet-based services, though two groups have been the primary focus of recent discussions about terrorist messaging online: large Internet companies and developers of encrypted messaging services. May could have, on the one hand, been referring to a group of Internet behemoths like Facebook, Google, and Twitter. These services, including Google-owned YouTube, are often used by terrorist groups to publicly post propaganda. Google’s Gmail is also the most popular email application for terrorists. In recent months, May’s Conservative Party has reportedly set its sights on Facebook and Google as the targets of a platform focused on controlling the spread of harmful messages online. This is likely because these two companies dominate the Internet. Facebook is the largest social network in most countries around the globe and boasts nearly 2 billion users (almost 30% of humans on the planet). Google is one of the world’s largest companies and maintains an 89% market share among search engines. Though Twitter has struggled in recent years, it is still one of the most popular social networks online. All three of these companies have been publicly condemned by British lawmakers as offering platforms for terrorism. On the other hand, May could have also, or separately, been referring to the companies and developers behind apps like Telegram, Signal, and Wickr (a fourth, WhatsApp, is owned by Facebook). These offer encrypted messaging services that hide a user’s identity and their communications. They are popular among terrorists for instant messaging and chatting. Telegram, in particular, is the “app of choice” for coordinating terrorist attacks—recent terrorist events across Europe were planned using the service. Former FBI Director James Comey was quite vocal in his disapproval of such apps after terrorist attacks in the U.S., calling encryption a “significant public safety problem” and troublesome for law enforcement. Identifying whether May was addressing problems associated with large Internet companies or smaller companies developing encrypted apps will drive any meaningful discussion about what, if anything, happens next. Facebook, Google, and Twitter are powerful American corporations that wield significant influence over Internet policy. They have collaborated for several years with each other and with governments to eliminate harmful communications from their websites. Telegram, on the other hand, is a German-based company with a user base roughly one-eighth the size of Facebook’s. Similarly, Wickr has a team of roughly 40 employees—small compared to the likes of Facebook, Google, and Twitter—and a founder who is a staunch privacy advocate. Companies like these do not have the same motivations to collaborate. Telegram, for example, has been criticized by European Union officials for lagging behind other social media companies in addressing terrorism. Both groups of companies, large and small, typically resist suggestions that more government regulation is needed for how they manage their Internet platforms and handle the communications that appear on them. Their concerns are legitimate; governments aren’t likely to be nimble enough to manage the rapidly changing dynamics of the Internet. And while public safety is a significant concern, companies using encryption technology are focused on protecting the privacy of law-abiding Internet users . Time will tell who and what in cyberspace will be the focus of any domestic or international efforts to regulate terrorist content online. Until then, it is important to frame these discussions in a more nuanced way.

In previous builds, the about screen would simply say that it was Android O Developer Preview, but it wouldn’t include an actual version number. That has changed with this third developer preview. It now shows Android 8.0, which is what many people were expecting for Android O, seeing as Android N was 7.0, Android M was 6.0 and Android L was 5.0. Android O still has a ways to go before it’s finished and available to all. Google isn’t slated to release the final version until around August of this year. Which is a similar time frame to what Google used last year with Android N. Launching the stable version ahead of their next hardware release. So it’s likely that the Pixel 2 would launch with Android 8.1, similar to the Pixel coming with Android 7.1 last year. Android O is a pretty big update for Android – although still not as huge as Android L or Android Lollipop was a few years ago. With Android O, Google is launching a slew of tiny tweaks to the OS, as well as adding picture-in-picture across the OS. This was a feature that launched in Nougat for Android TV, but now it’s coming to smartphones and tablets as well. Google also introduced Notification dots, so you can easily see which apps these are coming from, and also notification levels. So more important notifications are more visible then the less important ones. Google has one more developer preview that’s slated to come out before the final release in Q3. It’s likely that it’ll launch in early July, setting up for an August launch. With this third developer preview, API’s for Android O are now final, so developers can start getting their apps ready for Android O and even start publishing them on Google Play for users to download and use – whether they are on Android O or not. Android O is available for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 6P in the Android Beta program as of right now.

Greg DeMichillie, Director of Product Management, Office of the CTO, Google Cloud speaks at the GeekWire Cloud Tech Summit. Despite a lot of grumbling that Google needs to improve its enterprise sales outreach to properly compete in the cloud, the company still seems to think it’s best to put its technology first. “Very few people will grow up and be the scale of Google,” said Greg DeMichillie, director of product management in the Office of the CTO for Google Cloud. However, “what you do see is the problems we faced that caused us to build our infrastructure are pretty universal,” and showing cloud customers that they can benefit from what Google has learned resonates, he said at the GeekWire Cloud Tech Summit. Google is used to criticism that cloud computing is the one that got away from the search giant, which built an incredible array of custom data center hardware in the mid-2000s only to watch Amazon slowly grow into the dominant cloud player over that time frame. The company’s mindset has definitely changed: the cloud division is now easily Google’s fastest-growing group in terms of investments in headcount and research, and it’s doing much of that work in the Seattle area, DeMichillie said. And Google believes it has something competitors like AWS and Microsoft can’t match: “Google has been running the world’s largest private cloud for years,” he said. But while Google’s technology is indeed impressive, it’s not like AWS and Microsoft are stringing a few servers together with worn-out cables. Selling enterprise technology is generally a long, drawn-out process with lots of hand-holding and relationship building, and that’s something that Google had never done particularly well until Diane Greene was hired to oversee its cloud efforts in 2015. While acknowledging that Google is ramping up its softer side, DeMichillie said “we really do value an engineer to engineer conversation. When we can get a real Google engineer working on data flow sitting with an executive at Home Depot, the conversation becomes a lot deeper.” More Special Coverage: GeekWire Cloud Tech Summit 2017 Sponsor Post Salesforce is ready for you.

Microsoft Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie at the GeekWire Cloud Tech Summit. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) Amazon and Microsoft are at the top of the food chain in the growing cloud world, battling for everything from customers to talent. Both are based in the Seattle area, and for much of their histories, the two companies haven’t butted heads. But their respective cloud pushes have helped give the region the reputation as the cloud capital. And while they now compete fiercely, the two tech giants are also learning from one another. Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft’s Cloud and Enterprise Group, said this morning at the GeekWire Cloud Tech Summit that Microsoft has learned from Amazon’s data- and customer-driven approach to retail. He thinks Microsoft has taught Amazon a thing or two about working with enterprises and partners.  The cultures have gotten closer together over last the several years as a result of that cross pollination. As the top two cloud companies, there are obvious incentives to luring talent away. Plenty of tech executives around the area have spent time at both companies. And that has led to an interesting side effect, the blending of the two companies’ cultures, Guthrie said. “The cultures have gotten closer together over last the several years as a result of that cross pollination,” Guthrie said. The numbers show that Amazon is still the cloud leader, but Microsoft is gaining. In RightScale’s 2017 State of the Cloud report, 57 percent of respondents said they are using AWS to run applications in the public cloud, but that number is the same as 2015 and 2016. Meanwhile, 34 percent of those surveyed said they are running apps on Azure in the public cloud, up from 20 percent a year ago. Google’s share of this market has risen as well. These figures indicate that customers aren’t leaving AWS; rather the cloud market is consolidating around tech giants Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Among large enterprises, Microsoft is even closer to Amazon with 43 percent of respondents saying they use Azure in some way, to 59 percent for AWS. Obviously, these numbers exceed 100 percent, but many enterprises use multiple cloud providers. Google trails the top two but has also made gains in the cloud business. Guthrie said Google is not to be underestimated, but it is still figuring out the partner side of the cloud business. “I don’t see Google that often in most of the discussions we have with customers, whereas it’s pretty much Amazon and us in every single engagement competing,” Guthrie said. While Guthrie says he takes all competitors seriously, thinking too much about the competition rather than the customer can be a huge mistake. The best way to be successful, he said, is to focus — maybe even obsess — on making customers happy. It obviously starts with the technology. If a provider doesn’t have top-of-the-line tech capabilities, then it will be hard to compete. After that, issues of security and compliance can help close a deal, and that is an arena where Microsoft sees an advantage over Amazon. Another place where Microsoft gives itself the edge is working with other businesses. For example, Microsoft has a program that incentivizes its Azure sales people to work with startups and other businesses building products on Azure. If a startup sells something to a Microsoft customer, the Azure salesperson actually gets a bonus from Microsoft that represents about 10 percent of the annual contract value of that sale. The cloud has become a huge part of Microsoft’s bottom line. The company expects commercial cloud revenue to make up about 15 percent of its overall revenue this year. Guthrie sees the cloud business as one that requires plenty of up-front investment with the potential for a big long-term pay off. That extends to customers as well. A huge enterprise doesn’t instantly decide to move everything to the cloud or to one provider. Usually, a company starts small, or “dips a toe in the water,” as Guthrie put it, and then a year or two later the ramp up comes. “Rather than trying to get a big deal up front, it’s really about, get a small deal, get them successful and then they’ll move very fast,” Guthrie said. All of this is happening against a backdrop of rapidly decreasing prices for cloud storage. It’s another effect of the competitive landscape. Guthrie said Microsoft’s business model assumes that the trend isn’t going anywhere, and the company is ready for it. We’ll have video and more from Guthrie’s talk in an upcoming post.

(GeekWire photos/Kevin Lisota) “Cloud computing is the new operating system.” That’s what one venture capitalist said on stage at the inaugural GeekWire Cloud Tech Summit, and it’s a reminder of why it was so exciting to welcome more than 600 folks to our first technical event ever on Wednesday in Bellevue, Wash. It was an action-packed day that showcased the cutting-edge cloud-related trends and ideas that are transforming the technology world. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Amazon AI. Seahawks legends Steve Largent and Jim Zorn sign autographs and meet attendees at the Nintex booth at the Cloud Tech Summit. We had a great lineup of speakers and presenters — folks like Microsoft Azure chief Scott Guthrie; Docker CEO Steve Singh; Cloud Foundry Foundation Executive Director Abby Kearns; and others — who shared insight about the world of cloud computing and addressed pressing technical questions to our attendees about everything from DevOps to serverless computing. “It is no understatement to say that public cloud computing is revolutionizing how technology is used,” wrote Fortune reporter Barb Darrow, who attended the event.

We loved hosting a world-class conference of this kind in the Seattle area, which many consider the epicenter of the cloud industry with companies like Amazon and Microsoft, in addition to countless startups that are all building cloud-related technologies. “This is an incredible community with incredible technology talent,” said Singh, who announced that Docker is opening an office in the area, yet another Bay Area company planting its flag up north. “Obviously, it’s cloud city as well.” Excited that the @geekwire cloudtech summit is getting started.

Attendees spent the afternoon soaking up knowledge at three separate technical tracks — DevOps, Microservices/Serverless and Artificial Intelligence — as well as a business track that featured a venture capital panel, a media panel and a startup showcase.

They were paid too much Google takes on Apple in India with music streaming service at Rs 89/month Google Play spend up 70%, India key contributor Google is coming across some unusual challenges as it seeks to capture eye-level imagery of the most remote parts of the globe.   In a recent foray into the Australian outback, Google’s amateur cartographers used a backpack to lug bulky camera equipment around Uluru, a popular tourist site also known as Ayers Rock. One hitch: they had to avoid photographing certain parts of the red rock formation that are especially sacred to the local Aboriginal people.   Having taken shots of many of the world’s streets using cameras on vehicles, Google is moving to more difficult locations. On the South Pacific island of Vanuatu, where it captured images of a volcano, the company sought to photograph lava without any of its cameras falling in. And in Cambodia, monkeys destroyed its equipment.   The images are being used to enhance Street View, a component of the company’s popular Google Maps app, as the company searches for new features that will entice users. Starting today, users will be able to take a continuous, virtual walk around much of Uluru.   Maps are becoming more important to the world’s largest technology companies as they chase billions of dollars in potential advertising revenue and invest in something that is crucial to the autonomous-vehicle industry. The value of ads that are based on a user’s location will grow to $32 billion by 2021 from $12 billion in 2016 in the U.S., according to estimates from BIA/Kelsey, a media and advertising consulting firm. These location-targeted ads will take up 45 per cent of the mobile-ad market by 2021, the firm said, up from 38 percent last year.   Google, a part of Alphabet Inc.,  has been cautiously adding advertising to Google Maps. Last year, it unveiled “promoted pins,” where location markers appear in different colors to advertise certain businesses. The challenge for Google is integrating ads without cluttering the app.   Competitors in mapping include Apple Inc. and a host of other players, including privately-held Here Technologies, which is part-owned by German automakers Audi AG , BMW AG and Daimler AG. In the market for general consumers, Google has a clear lead. Google Maps was the fourth most popular mobile app overall in the U.S., while Apple Maps was the 12th most popular, according to a 2016 report from comScore.   On Monday, Apple said it would add floor plans for airports and malls in cities like Hong Kong, London and Chicago to its Maps app. It also is updating the app to show speed limits and lane navigation for drivers. The company hasn’t said anything about extending its maps to remote locations.   While Here Technologies isn’t focusing on cultural sites like Uluru in the same way as Google is, it has a fleet of camera-equipped cars mapping roads in remote regions of the Philippines.   “Cars have been stuck in mud, cars have not been too successful in crossing creeks and rivers, and cars have been stuck in sand,” said Brent Stafford, Here’s Asia-Pacific director.   At Uluru, a roughly 2,800-kilometer drive northwest of Sydney in the central Australian desert, Google relied on amateur human cartographers, though in other remote locations, camera packs were donned by animals. An elephant helped to map in Thailand, and a camel wore a camera pack in the United Arab Emirates.   “This is not a case of driving up there in a four-wheel drive and just going off road,” said Casey Whitelaw, engineering director for Google Maps in Sydney.   Google was approached by tourism officials from Australia’s Northern Territory, where Uluru is located, to map the site. It also worked with Parks Australia, which operates the country’s national parks, and the Aboriginal community near Uluru. It is a spiritual site for Aboriginal Australians and tourists flock to the red rock to see it change colors at sunrise and sunset.   “I hope it’s not going to mean that people will look at it at home and think, ‘Oh, OK, well I don’t need to go to Uluru now,’” said Sammy Wilson, a local Aboriginal leader who also chairs the board for Uluru’s national park, speaking through an interpreter in the Pitjantjatjara language. “I hope that it will make them think about what more there is to learn and understand and appreciate from visiting here.”   Google was given a map that showed which areas of Uluru were too sensitive to photograph. Mr. Wilson offered a metaphor to explain why visitors are discouraged from taking pictures of some areas. He said Uluru as a whole is like a living room, a place to receive visitors. But particularly sacred areas around the rock are like a bedroom, a private area where visitors shouldn’t go.   By adding more remote sites to its maps, analysts say Google—which has a reputation for “moonshot” projects and public-minded goals like organizing the world’s information—is ensuring its consumers will continue to use its app, which offers opportunities to attract users to other company products.   Imaging places like a volcano “sounds like a very Google-y thing to do, even if that by itself is not something that can be commercialized,” said Colin Sebastian, a research analyst at Baird in San Francisco.

It is a spiritual site for Aboriginal Australians and tourists flock to the red rock to see it change colors at sunrise and sunset.   “I hope it’s not going to mean that people will look at it at home and think, ‘Oh, OK, well I don’t need to go to Uluru now,’” said Sammy Wilson, a local Aboriginal leader who also chairs the board for Uluru’s national park, speaking through an interpreter in the Pitjantjatjara language. “I hope that it will make them think about what more there is to learn and understand and appreciate from visiting here.”   Google was given a map that showed which areas of Uluru were too sensitive to photograph. Mr. Wilson offered a metaphor to explain why visitors are discouraged from taking pictures of some areas. He said Uluru as a whole is like a living room, a place to receive visitors. But particularly sacred areas around the rock are like a bedroom, a private area where visitors shouldn’t go.   By adding more remote sites to its maps, analysts say Google—which has a reputation for “moonshot” projects and public-minded goals like organizing the world’s information—is ensuring its consumers will continue to use its app, which offers opportunities to attract users to other company products.   Imaging places like a volcano “sounds like a very Google-y thing to do, even if that by itself is not something that can be commercialized,” said Colin Sebastian, a research analyst at Baird in San Francisco.

(AP / Marcio Jose Sanchez) Tali Arbel, The Associated Press Published Thursday, June 8, 2017 1:35PM EDT Last Updated Thursday, June 8, 2017 2:46PM EDT NEW YORK -- Verizon has a simple goal in buying Yahoo: It wants to challenge Google and Facebook in the huge and lucrative field of digital advertising. But Verizon faces its own challenge in doing so, given that it will be competing against a slew of other companies also looking to break in. Verizon wants to become a strong third choice for advertisers by adding Yahoo's popular sites and billion users worldwide to its own media business, which includes AOL and Verizon's home-grown go90 video service. It can place ads on those sites, and can also combine data from visitors to those sites with AOL's ad technologies and sales teams, and possibly also personal data from Verizon mobile customers such as location and other information, in order to better target ads at individuals. Verizon has programs that use mobile-customer data for targeted ads and may combine that with data gathered by AOL and Yahoo. Verizon says customers can choose whether to participate. Yahoo's shareholders on Thursday approved the $4.5 billion sale of its key businesses to Verizon. The deal is expected to close by Tuesday. The combination of AOL and Yahoo will cut 15 per cent of its 14,000-person workforce, or about 2,100 jobs, said a person familiar with the matter who requested not to be identified discussing details of the cuts. Yahoo and AOL are "positioned to do better together than apart," Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. But he is setting the bar low. While Verizon talks of growth from the deal, Wieser said "not declining would be a success. Five years from now, if the combined entity were the same size as it is today, I would consider that to be successful." THE VISION Verizon sees online ads -- particularly targeted ads -- as a potential new source of growth as the wireless industry fights for U.S. users with lower prices and other discounts. Verizon has "essentially turned into a no-growth business," said CFRA Research's Angelo Zino. The ad business would be a "big deal" for Verizon if it goes well, he said. Tim Armstrong, the former Google executive who joined AOL as CEO in 2009, has for years wanted to combine AOL with the long-declining Yahoo. Although AOL has big-name properties such as HuffPost and Engadget, it hasn't been as big of an online destination as Yahoo's mail, finance, sports and other properties. The combined business, to be called Oath, will expand its news, sports, entertainment, finance and lifestyle coverage. Like everyone else, Oath will focus on video and mobile, where consumers increasingly spend their time online. Armstrong says he wants Oath properties to be a place consumers "come and visit every day" and predicts users growing to 2 billion from 1.3 billion by 2020, with annual revenue of $10 billion to $20 billion from roughly $7 billion today. Lowell McAdam, CEO of New York-based Verizon, teased last month that this could set the stage for a new streaming video service, competing with the slew of internet-TV services already out there. Verizon already has a free mobile video service, go90, that isn't well known. ALTERNATIVES TO THE DUOPOLY Facebook and Google together draw about half the world's spending on digital ads, and in the U.S., they're even more dominant. They're also where the majority of mobile-ad dollars go, eMarketer data show. The sway Facebook and Google hold for advertisers isn't expected to change in the next few years. They had a head start on mobile. Yahoo has poured billions into acquisitions that have helped Yahoo make some leeway in mobile -- but not enough. It's gotten better at doing mobile ads, but it has had no major hit apps. Still, AOL and Yahoo together provide a much-smaller No. 3 in the U.S. for advertisers looking to reach lots of people. But even if Verizon's goal is to just be happy at No. 3, there are several much smaller players that also draw advertisers. Snapchat is a niche hit with young people. Amazon has an under-the-radar ad business that supports its e-commerce dominance. Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, is expected to grow its piece of the ad pie; Microsoft will be just behind the combined AOL-Yahoo in the U.S. once the deal closes. Twitter, although it's sorting out its ad business, is a significant smaller player. Globally, several Chinese companies also rake in ad dollars. And the combined company will also have to compete for people's attention, and not just with other services that rely on ad dollars to survive. Popular sites like Amazon or Netflix also suck up time spent online, said eMarketer analyst Martin Utreras. "They've acquired these two dinosaurs and you kind of wonder, can they be successful?" Zino said. That will depend on Verizon being able to convince marketers that they know more about consumers than anyone else, he said. AP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke contributed to this story.

Users of all sorts can take part in the release of this newest version of Android – regardless of the name “Developer Preview” – since it’s relatively stable as such. Regardless – take caution: this version was released by Google, and is part of the public Beta program, but any software that’s released before it’s public release finalized might have some bugs in it. This version of the software includes hints of key themes presented by Google at their developer conference several weeks ago. Fluid Experiences and Vitals and Project Treble – all coming to Android soon – are pushed forward with the release of this version of Android right here. Project Treble, especially, is a feature we’re looking forward to in a major way, not least of all because it’ll allow future Android devices to get timely updates from Android without help from vendors. Project Treble comes with Android O and will come with all versions of Android from that point forward. Just so long as it works how Google intends! Project Treble code was included in the first Developer Preview of Android O for Google Pixel phones, as it were. Watch: What’s new in Android O (says Google) To take a crack at an Android O preview 3 download click the Android Beta Program link now. From there, devices that work with the Android O Beta Program will be given access to the newest version of Android out in the universe today. Newest beyond Google’s developers, that is. Note that this Android O Beta Program does not work with every Android device in the world – just some! The following devices are able to run the newest version of Android with the Android O Beta Program now: Google’s Android Beta Program phones: • Nexus 5X • Nexus 6P • Nexus Player • Pixel C • Pixel • Pixel XL It’s quite likely that Google will continue their Android Beta Program beyond this round of Pixel devices, too.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Home vs Amazon Echo vs Apple HomePod: features comparison Features Newsby Robert Triggs12 hours ago 2 202 15 The battle for the smart home has been warring on for some time already, but Apple has just entered the fray with the introduction of its new HomePod. The HomePod was unveiled during the company’s WWDC 2017 keynote, and the smart home speaker is clearly designed to take on the likes of Google Home and the market leading Amazon Echo. So here’s how the devices stack up against one another. For starters, there’s a big difference in the price between these three products. We’re all used to Apple charging a premium for its products, but at $349 the HomePod is almost twice the price of Amazon’s $179.99 Echo and considerably more expensive than the $129 Google Home. One of the key differentiators, from Apple’s perspective, is that the HomePod offers up a superior looking speaker setup to its competitors, while still aiming to offer many of the same smart features as its rivals.   Amazon Echo Apple HomePod Google Home Assistant Alexa Siri Google Assistant Music support Amazon Music, Prime Music, Amazon Music Unlimited, Spotify Premium, Pandora, TuneIn, iHeartRadio, Audible Apple Music Google Play Music, Spotify Premium, YouTube Music, Pandora, iHeartRadio, TuneIn Multi-room Not currently Yes with AirPlay 2 Yes with Chromecast Audio Smart Home & third-party support Yes HomeKit only Yes Microphones 7 far-field 6 far-field + 1 low-frequency calibration microphone 2 far-field Speakers 2.0-inch tweeter + 2.5-inch woofer 7x tweeter + woofer 2-inch driver + 2x 2-inch passive radiators Connectivity Bluetooth & Wi-Fi Wi-Fi (Bluetooth currently unknown) Bluetooth & Wi-Fi Dimensions and weight 235 x 84 mm 2.34lbs 172 x 142 mm 5.5lbs 142.8 x 96.4 mm 1.05lbs Price $180 $349 $129 The HomePod comes with seven tweeter speakers and a dedicated woofer setup, each with a “custom amplifier” configuration. This is clearly a more substantial and expensive setup than the single tweeter and woofer combination offered by the Echo and the single speaker, dual passive radiator configuration touted by the Google Home. This makes the HomePod considerably bulkier than its competitors too, coming in at 5.5 lbs and 172 x 142 mm. The Google Home weighs 1.05 lbs and has 142.8 x 96.4 mm dimensions, and the slim Echo is 2.34 lbs and 235 x 84 mm. Apple's HomePod is being marketed primarily as a high-end home speaker with extra smart assistant capabilities. This is much different compared to the angle taken by Amazon and Google. Apple also made mention of transparent dynamic processing and audio beamforming capabilities to improve its audio input. The six far-field microphones and additional low frequency microphone stack up nicely against the Echo’s seven far-field mic setup, while Google’s technology only required two far-field microphones. None of them should have any problems picking up commands though, even in a bustling living room. Of course, we’ll have to wait and see exactly how much better the sound is, if at all, and if it’s worth the price tag. Apple’s premium audio offering may be a tough sell in this market which has proven itself to be quite price sensitive too. There’s always the option to connect a $50 Amazon Echo Dot up to a more premium Hi-Fi setup. Furthermore, we may see partner speakers from more renowned audio brands that support Alexa and Google Assistant appear in the not too distant future as well. See also: Google Home review – the future of the home? November 18, 2016 On the software and features side, in true Apple form, the HomePod system and third-party support is completely locked down, therefore offering a lot less choice than the established models. This may well change with time, but at launch the Amazon Echo and Google Home offer substantially more choice for both music streaming services and compatible smart home products. See also: The complete list of services with Google Home support 3 weeks ago Despite the audio focus, the HomePod doesn't support any third party streaming services at the moment. You'll have to make do with Apple Music. The HomePod only currently supports Apple Music, which will be a disappointment to fans of other popular services, such as Spotify or Pandora which are supported on Amazon and Google’s platforms. It’s a similar situation if you’re looking to stream to using a multi-room setup. The HomePod supports the more limited new AirPlay 2 Wi-Fi standard, which again doesn’t support these third-party services, while Chromecast Audio does. However, Apple’s Craig Federighi has suggested that third-party apps may be supported by AirPlay 2 at some point. This all ties into Apple’s proprietary play for the smart home market through its HomeKit product range. If you’re looking to integrate the HomePod with some other smart home products, then you’re limited to manufacturers that comply with Apple’s HomeKit standard. Amazon’s Echo range has taken a much more open approach here, opening up support for almost anything third party manufacturer through its Alexa Skills voice-driven platform. Of course, then there are the capabilities of the smart assistants to consider. We won’t go too deep here, but Google’s Assistant has proven highly capable when it comes to understanding more complex requests, contextual awareness, and the ability to ask follow-up questions. Alexa not so much on the contextual side but it does support a huge range of commands, while Siri sits somewhere in between not quite matching the intelligence of Google nor Alexa’s huge third-party catalogue. Echo and Home are clearly being publicized as connected smart speakers, with the assistants taking a key role when marketing the products. Apple is focusing more on the high-end home speaker angle, with Siri’s capabilities taking a little more of a backseat. Furthermore, it look like the HomePod is aimed more at those who are already sold on Apple’s ecosystem rather than those who use third-party services. This might not be a bad place to start in order to grab a share of the smart home market, but it might prevent the HomePod from being a breakthrough product. If you’re tempted by Apple’s proposition then you’ll be in for a wait. The HomePod isn’t going to land in consumer hands until December, and a lot could change by then, as could the competition.

Search News provided by seoClarity 08 Jun, 2017, 14:39 ET Share this article CHICAGO, June 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- For years, brands have fought to make it onto the first page of Google search results for relevant keywords. But with the rise of Google's Answer Box and the increasing use of voice search, being on page one is no longer enough. The new challenge — and opportunity — for brands is to be the single answer to reach customers. seoClarity, the search insights and content optimization platform, today introduced Answer Box Opportunity, the first and only feature of its kind to help brands "win" the Google Answer Box, which is triggered for more than nearly 20 percent of all searches. Using Answer Box Opportunity, brands can more effectively: Identify keywords that trigger Answer Boxes. Understand how competitors rank and trend for Answer Box-triggering keywords. Get recommendations to optimize content to win the Answer Box. "For the company that 'wins' the Answer Box, the opportunity is enormous — and the brands that fall behind without a strategy will lose out on new customers," said Mitul Gandhi, Chief Architect and Co-Founder of seoClarity. "Whether customers are searching through a browser or using voice to search on Google, brands need to be that single answer — they need to be in the Answer Box." As the single answer provided by Google, the Answer Box instantly increases a brand's visibility and credibility. The Answer Box's importance has only grown with the increasing use of voice search, as demonstrated by the statistics below: 65 percent of Answer Box-triggering keywords phrases contain between three to five words, which suggests natural language queries made by voice. According to ComScore, nearly 40 percent of adults use voice search at least one time per day. "At seoClarity, we create tools that help brands optimize for search experiences, not search engines," said Gandhi. "If the user is going to the Answer Box, or is using voice, then we want brands to be right there waiting for them."

Google wants to make it easy for carriers to have interoperable RCS messaging Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/06/07 2:18pm PDTJun 7, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 174 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares261 Carriers Google News Last week Sprint and Rogers announced that users sending messages between the two carriers will be able to make use of RCS. RCS, of course, is the new standard to replace SMS that Google committed to back in 2015. So far each carrier seems to have its own idea for how RCS should work. But Google's recent work in cross-carrier communication is a big step towards ubiquity, and thanks to the tech behind this latest interconnect other carriers can more easily get in on the RCS action. We are deploying a "hub" model, so that carriers can interconnect to the hub once to get access to all other carriers connected to the hub. — Nick Fox (@RealNickFox) June 5, 2017 Google's Nick Fox followed up his announcement on the 1st with an answer to a question posed by our own Artem about how Google's RCS interconnect works. Instead of requiring that carriers individually connect their networks in some capacity to one another to exchange RCS messages, the RCS standards used by Google and the GSMA make use of a hub-style interconnect. Google's hub-based implementation of RCS in the recent cross-carrier announcement isn't a new technology, but it is cool. Back in 2013, the GSM Association published a white paper that detailed how RCS could work — and it's very much worth a read if you are even mildly interested in the future of carrier messaging, RCS, or even just networking. The white paper showed a few different methods for RCS implementation, such as using a direct NNI (Network-Network Interface) decentralized network for each carrier interconnection. Unfortunately, that particular solution results in a quickly rising number of interconnects as the number of carriers increases (n(n - 1) / 2), which means for each additional carrier in the network a larger investment needs to be made by those in it. The white paper also talked about a hub model for RCS, which has clear advantages for carriers. Rather than be burdened with developing their own connections to other carriers, each needs only connect to the one central hub presumably provided by Google. But, this centralized system will likely suffer from the same sort of weaknesses that all centralized systems do. For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. A central network is also more susceptible to censorship, attacks, or interference. However, it also provides some advantages, such as decreasing the investment of time and resources for carriers joining the standard. 4 node interconnect vs 36 The hub system proposed in the white paper (based on Openmind Networks implementation for SMS/MMS) does have drawbacks, but fewer connections might end up meaning faster deployment. And since Google has already done the work bringing the hub network up for Sprint and Rogers, each additional carrier should only responsible for its connection to that hub, as opposed to managing every link to every other RCS carrier themselves. Perhaps the recent news might help other carriers be persuaded to adopt Google's version of RCS, if for no other reason than cost-cutting. Why manage a ton of different networks for RCS when they can let Google cough up the cash for infrastructure? After all, if there's one thing carriers love, it's money.

Release 2 of the RCS universal profile which is to contain the needed information for third-party apps (Like Textra) to utilize RCS features will be released very soon. http://i.imgur.com/HLbSwcy.jpg https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ns9oV0Dh8_S5M-JHDvJ8sNHR6rpbiq2N6qZlP3g9zQ/edit Ryne Hager The beauty of that document makes me feel bad about my Google Docs skills. Jayson Stephenson Trust me, it wasn't anywhere that great to begin with. I really learned a lot with this doc and the amazing features/flexibility that G-Drive has. Snowsky Mountain Does this mean I can use third-party apps like the SMS Backup & Restore app to backup and restore RCS messages? Jayson Stephenson Yes, but even better. RCS Messages are by default synced to your carriers cloud infrastructure. So if you were to change phones/tablets your messages will be in sync with whatever device you use. Snowsky Mountain Where would I go to turn off/on that syncing of messages? Would it be from a messaging app, like the Android Messages app? Or would it be through my carrier? Also, I wonder what (if any) effect that would have on T-Mobile's DIGITS service, which appears to do something similar for SMS/MMS messages... Jayson Stephenson I'm not 100% yet. But I believe your answer might be on what Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en MJ I have no interest in my carrier storing my messages. No thanks... I hope this can be turned off. Jayson Stephenson I'm sure a lot of people will agree with you. As I mentioned to Snowsky, I believe the option for that will be on whatever Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en Latheryin There goes your privacy. Dmitri Smirnov There was never any to begin with in the SMS world. Latheryin That completely is a matter of the country to live in. Dmitri Smirnov SS7 vulnerabilities prove, that lack of privacy transcends borders :) Also, there is nothing preventing your carrier to store the SMS "for technical reasons" regardless of a country. At any rate, while RCS might be a weird attempt to catch up with the messenger market, it is definitely not worse than the SMS. Latheryin Acutally there is. At least in the states. There are laws that prevent them from being more then a pass through. As for the messaging market. That also depends on the country you live in. Data messengers are bigger in developing countries then they are say in the states. A perfect example is that 3% of the US population even use a messaging app as their primary. SMS or just flat out calling is the preffered. David Ruddock Cool doc, but Verizon and AT&T are both signatories on the RCS Universal Profile. That doesn't compel them to do anything, but it seems unlikely they'd sign if they didn't intend to be compatible with the universal profile at some point, which is what Google Jibe is based on. Jayson Stephenson It doesn't say anywhere they they ever will implement it. In fact I expect they won't for a long time. All it mentions is their RCS is a proprietary format meaning it will work on only their internal networks. Also check out my comment on AT&T. newtonfb ATT showed a demo of it at MWC(I see that you made that comment on the doc, you should include the twitter picture also). I dont see why ATT and Tmobile will not have the UP out by the end of the year. Verizon is a different story as they have not showed or said anything about it. Jayson Stephenson The doc is open source. ;) Latheryin Yes attached showed it but it plans on placing it on top of their SMS setup not as a replacement. wicketr I think what he's saying is that "yes, it's proprietary now, but they planning on having UP with an unconfirmed launch date". The same is true for most of these. T-Mobile's is currently proprietary, but has been rumored to be UP completed by the end of the year. But it's undetermined if it's going to use Google's hub, or implement the RCS UP using Samsung's infratructure across the boards. Jayson Stephenson Yes, sorry for the confusion. I will see if I can design it any better. But so far the only carrier which we know guaranteed is in the process of installing the UP is T-Mobile. Which is mentioned in the doc. Tom Erlandsen Calling it now, I bet Allo gets RCS support fairly soon after this release Joshua Why? Android Messages - which has RCS - is made by Google. They could have implemented RCS into Allo this whole time. Tom Erlandsen Because Google wants Allo to succeed, and the absolute best way they can do that is by having some kind of carrier messaging fallback. They're not going to do SMS fallback, the Allo lead has come out and said that before. But they've never said they won't do RCS fallback. And the fact that Android Messages has RCS support means absolutely nothing. Google is infamous for its A/B tests, so it's hardly a stretch to imagine them having two apps with RCS support. If Allo with RCS fallback proves very popular and successful, I could imagine them discontinuing Android Messages and making Allo with RCS the default messaging app on Android, requiring OEMs to bundle it with their devices. But I only think they'll do that if Allo proves to be a success, as otherwise they'll face massive OEM backlash Joshua They wont discontinue Android Messages because here in Canada where RCS has been out for months, carriers have said in 2018 Android Messages is shipping with all of their devices. Tom Erlandsen Like I said, I don't think they'd discontinue Android Messages unless Allo was poised to take its place (i.e. had a decent userbase). And that would take a while to happen, even with RCS support. So yeah Android Messages will probably stay for a while, until Google has something it feels would make a better replacement, and I think that's what they'll try and build Allo into Jayson Stephenson You have a very similar theory as I do. I think the point of the renaming of Google Messages to "Android Messages" is to give all AOSP devices a baseline messenger app that is not branded with the Google name, and supports whatever standard your carrier utilizes. (SMS/MMS/RCS) Obviously Allo will not be getting full-SMS support at all for obvious reasons....(https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/53uvvu/why_sms_fallback_isnt_the_holy_grail_you_all/) But it might be possible for it to get RCS support and still allowing it to view, send, and receive SMS messages. As SMS messages are connected to your carriers data infrastructure instead of tied to your phone storage. (If you have an RCS compatible carrier) You can have Allo to communicate to any non-Allo contacts while still utilizing its rich features with Allo-Allo communication. Although I'm not sure if such an app/feature is even possible. If it were, we could see a messenger revolution! Abraham No this is how I see it. Android Messages is a very generic simple SMS/RCS platform. No real branding, no real benefit for Google. This makes carriers happy as they are not shoving Google on everyones faces by default. Allo, if it gets RCS support. Will be the Google branded, with Google assistant and many more things. But this will be for the user to decide if they want to use. Not set as default to keep the user and carriers happy. What do you guys think? Joshua More likely. Allo will never replace Android Messages. Android Messages is a very lightweight, clean, and basic app. Allo is full of many (some might call pointless) features most don't want or need. Allo is slow to open compared to Android Messages, which could get annoying if you just want to send a quick SMS/RCS message. McStagger are you keeping that spreadsheet updated? Jayson Stephenson Most certainly! .w oh, and google will be in the center of our communication even more! and if someone opts to use basic sms, which doesn't use internet and such one will end up being processed but damn google... how "noble" of them, and they will probably do this also for "free" (i.e. "only" our data will be collected)... 😆😄 Better Google than Amazon, Facebook, or Apple. That's for sure. .w I'm not so sure about that, given google cluster-freck attitude towards messaging apps... None of the above looks great tbh... Nana Adu-Krow Not sure what is so hard to understand about their messaging apps. Each one serves a different purpose. And if you feel like there's apps that lack certain functionality (like web app support or something) you have the option to use something 3rd party. .w ROTFL, I didn't say that it's hard to understand but the purpose of messaging app is, well... messaging. In case of google you have abundance of messaging apps and if they have distinctive functionality it's even worse - there should be single app that handles all the basics and does it well. That's not the case in google messaging ecosystem. Why would I put my feet in that mess? Just to find out that in a couple of months google would introduce yet another messaging app? or in case of operators - say that they were mistaken if not 100% chooses their solution. Bottomline - trusting google services, especially those not well established (like mail, calendar, docs or android ecosystem) is veeeery risky... Cakefish When will RCS come to the UK? NathanDrago My knowledge is that SMS have basically disappeared. I only receive SMS from my bank and my carrier. Everybody is using WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it. What's the purpose of this effort for RCS? Is RCS more capable than WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it? David Ruddock SMS is still widely used in the USA. NathanDrago But don't you suspect that by the time this standard even starts to spread, USA will already have caught up with the rest of the world (that is, abandoning non-data messages)? It seems to me a lot of wasted resources. raddacle Considering how comfortable people are with services like iMessage which discriminates against other OS's, I don't see SMS going anywhere for the US. SMS is as standard as possible for the US right now. The only way to change the standard is by forcing it, hence RCS. Santos Chavez iMessage says nope, sorry. iPhones are actually a lot more popular here in the USA than the rest of the world. Hence people never switch to other apps.Hence those iPhone users messaging an Android user and oops, it's an SMS now because, yeah, Android doesn't have iMessage. The Android user also wouldn't change apps either if their current SMS app allows them to chat with all of their iPhone using friends. Like me, for instance, I'm the only one in my group of 5 friends that uses an Android phone. Hence, my default SMS app, Android Messages,is all I need to talk with them. They don't switch apps because amongst themselves they use iMessage which is enough as they get advanced messaging features. See what I mean? RCS would at the very least make Android---> Android users have those same advanced messaging features they'd get with other apps. Pushing RCS as the standard works for us here because we've never switched out of using SMS apps. .w This highly depends on the country... Peter Obligatory XKCD https://m.xkcd.com/927/ Dat Nguyen Here in Belgium, SMS is still used (well less than before) because when it comes to mobile subscriptions, Belgium is one of the countries that has expensive prices. For example, for 15€ a month, the carrier I use gives you 2,5 hours of calling, unlimited texting and 1,5 Gb of data so it's not like I can enable the data 24/7 And none of the carriers in Belgium doesn't seem to be aware of RCS AbdulB1 keep it on 3g. You will survive within limits Ryne Hager RCS is supposed to be an open replacement for SMS/MMS. But it is really just another competing standard. At least when compared to things like WhatsApp it isn't a private system. Any carrier that wants to can jump on and start using RCS for messaging, while WhatsApp is not so open and requires that you use their app the way they want you to. So TL:DR RCS is just supposed to replace old standards. bekifft Obligatory XKCD: https://xkcd.com/927/ Latheryin Data only messaging services are not really used a lot in the states and many other places. Data rates are just too high where SMS is unlimited free. Kyle Salewski Really hoping that since Google is behind this, and with the recent revamp of Google Voice, that RCS would soon come to GV. Anyone have any insight on the complexity behind that? Or would it be really difficult since Google Voice isn't a traditional "carrier" but more of a middle man. David Ruddock It would make sense as a reason for them bringing it back from the brink of death, if nothing else. bekifft But Google Voice / Hangouts are the core of the Frankenstein monster that is Google Fi. They seem to be trying to kill both brands, so it makes more sense to do this as part of Google Fi. But maybe GV / GFi is just more A / B testing. Willie Chalmers III More like A/B/C/D/E testing for a messaging strategy. Santos Chavez I think Nick Fox also mentioned on Twitter that they're working on bringing RCS to Project Fi. Project Fi uses Google Voice as the back end for most of its functions so perhaps adding RCS to Voice is pretty much necessary for it to come to Fi-- maybe they'll "talk" to the same server, as such. Project Fi numbers are Google Voice numbers after all, technically. Snowsky Mountain Is an Internet connection required to send and receive RCS messages? Jay Yes. h4rr4r So then why bother with it over XMPP? Snowsky Mountain So what would happen if I had a cellular connection but no Internet (no Wi-Fi or data)? Would it fall back to SMS/MMS? Jay Yep, you got it! John Doe VoLTE? Phone service requires Internet now so why not messages? Evan Anderson For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. This is an extremely unlikely situation. Any large network system, such as this one, will have plenty of redundancy and excess capacity to avoid ever overloading the system. Star network topology is standard these days, so this architecture makes perfect sense. Any other topology is highly inefficient. Snowsky Mountain I wonder what would happen if that were to occur, though. Maybe it would fall back to SMS/MMS? Ryne Hager It's definitely unlikely, I'm more concerned about denial of service implications from a centralized system. Decentralized might be more expensive for the carriers, but it would be more robust. Houston Texas Robust how? Borgman Say Android Messages gets RCS on all carriers and stuff. What then will be the incentive to use Allo or other IM? Sruly J Well Allo has bots... Marcellus1 It'll be the particular feature set of each offering. I could use Allo because I like the bot and you could use WhatsApp because you like the stickers, for example, but it wouldn't matter that we aren't using the same app--which would be awesome and would drive competition better. Borgman But Allo won't get RCS, correct? Won't that remain an IM (unfortunately?). Or by some miracle (thanks to RCS) I'd be able to use Allo and message someone on imessage? Or are IM a whole nother story for a later date? (I just wish I could use X app and send messages, full resolution photos, HD video, read receipt, typing notify, to someone on Y app). Marcellus1 I don't know specifically what apps will get RCS and what ones won't. Hopefully all messaging apps will support it at some point. I suspect if there are any holdouts, iMessage would be the main one just because Apple likes to be intentionally incompatible. The goal of RCS, though, is to have exactly what you said is your wish. Borgman Man I sure hope that happens!!! Latheryin Will never take off as the standard. Not for a least 10 years. Joshua Canada already has had RCS for many months. We only have a few carriers, so it can easily be standard in Canada. Latheryin Everywhere has it. It is just a matter of who will be using it and what version they will use. It will end up like Android pay.. It to mention that is a but too much privacy that many people just will not freely Give up. Mainly not with the anti Google movement going on right now. Marty For some reason the headline of this article made me remember what I used to think about Google several years ago. I was of the opinion that the mentality at Google was of forging a future of making everything free...at least free in the phone and service market to start. Back then my impression of Google was that it was lead by activistic, hippy-culture young people who wanted everything in life to be free. I felt Google would try to lead society to forge such a mindset that "profit" was evil and that humanity being free from wants and needs was the future they wanted. Viktor Ivanov Good thing they aren't, I'd be really worried if they were. Marty Maybe they were to a certain extent but couldn't manage to bring their ideals to fruition. The people running the show right now seem to be money-driven. Syukri Lajin Google trying to make the carriers move to a more centralized system. Good thing they showed good example by not making another messaging app just for RCS. :D freshprince_87 I hope the other 3 US carriers (T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T) adopts Google's RCS messaging network so that RCS finally replaces SMS/MMS forever . SMS/MMS needs to freaking die already! When that happens, there won't be a need for iMessage and it's blue bubbles anymore 😒. Because every phone except for iPhones (unless Apples updates it's messages app in iOS 11)will have the Google's version of iMessage messaging service, RCS, in the United States. Borgman I don't know how many bozo iphone friends I have who say "the picture you just send is hazy" or "why does Android not send HD pics or videos". Drives me crazy! Just want a simple way to send those things to my friends! Warren Skipper No matter if the rest of the world uses RCS, Apple will never adopt it simply because it involves connecting to Google. Add on top of the fact that Google will likely have access to all messages that come through and you have a perfect recipe for Apple to publicly stand against it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson Not sure what you mean by "Connecting to Google", if Apple were to ever adopt RCS they would just have to utilize the exact same API's that every other OEM (Windows Phones, Android, etc...) uses. The only thing Google is doing is promoting the standard and trying to push adoption. Warren Skipper From everything I've read, there are some parts of the universal profile that seem to be Google-specific. In this article by Mobilesyrup, the carrier network Rogers stated “It’s a Google managed service”: http://mobilesyrup.com/2017/05/11/rcs-messaging-sms-canada-explainer/ I could be wrong though.Even if so, Apple wouldn't adopt it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson What he was mentioning in that paragraph that you quoted was the Google Jibe platform which those carriers have agreed to utilize to have Google host the server infrastructure for them. Look at the previous paragraph... "One point Sarhangi is quick to reiterate multiple times throughout our interview is that RCS “is not a Google service.”" RCS is NOT a Google exclusive service. Any Carrier, or OS, or Hardware manufacturer can utilize RCS 100% without any involvement of Google whatsoever. Warren Skipper You're mistaken what I'm saying. I know this is not Google exclusive. I also understand that any carrier can implement it along with OEMs like Samsung who can host the servers in lieu of Google. However, it's highly likely that Google has some form of code within the universal profile itself, that they can track, that is beyond whoever implements RCS. Again I could be wrong but either way, RCS has to go through someone's servers and who's ever it is will have the ability to mine everything that goes through it. Nicholas Conrad But apple hates industry standard, it interferes with their platform lock-in. mrjayviper Did that mean SMS communications will be data mined by Google as well? I believe they can't do that right now? h4rr4r Why not? They can read anything the device sends. If you own the kernel you own it all. mrjayviper Google can't read my SMS right now success they are not part of the process Ryan yes, they can. as he said they can technically read anything that exits your phone, if they choose to do so. This is how the current sms backup function works. Also if you use android messages they are already in the process mrjayviper i don't backup my SMS h4rr4r Google made the software that displays the text. If you use an Android phone. eddiepearson Honestly, don't care about this unless this means TMO will implement this tomorrow. All of this is null if TMO continues to not give a crap. You can get those free poop goodies every Tuesday though. bekifft The Venn diagram of people on Sprint with friends in Canada (and vice versa) are going to be very excited about this! JD So what Google is saying is RCS will be an unreliable POS that will be in Beta forever. Santos Chavez No that is not at all what they're saying. thecoolkid So now Google will be reading our texts too...? kamiller42 Control the hub? Control the world! Nice one, stop shop for intelligence agencies. Will hub participants be given access to all traffic on the hub? I'm sure Google will. "Better to mine you with my pretty!" MeCampbell30 I'm sure the carriers have no intention of letting google profit at their expense. kamiller42 The answer? Enticement. Offer the carriers the access to the products of the data mining. "We all benefit." Abhishek Saral RCS is just for SMS or are there any other benefits? senoredusty Separate ideas. Your question doesn't really make sense. Think of RCS ad the evolution of SMS Abhishek Saral Try to understand the context. It's just for sending messages or something else. senoredusty Yes. It's like fancy SMS. Read receipts, higher quality media, typing indicators, etc. Abhishek Saral People in US should start using WhatsApp already. Instead of making things tough for everyone. senoredusty Everyone in the US uses SMS already. If, over the course of time, people are naturally transitioned from SMS to RCS, that's a lot smaller a barrier than trying to convince each and every person to install yet another app. Sprint is going in the right direction with this, having Android Messages installed by default on all new Android devices. Also IMO WhatsApp is ugly. I don't want to use it, so I'm not about to try to convince everyone else they should. I'd much rather see Textra gain RCS functionality. Duder12 Fixed for you. *iPhone users in US should stop using iMessage already. Instead of making things tough for everyone.* Jay Who care? Americans have locked themselves into a vicious cycle, where 'SMS FALLBACK' in 2017 is necessary and their own self created injury infliction about being the 'green text' to 'blue text' users. Be it whatsapp or telegram or wechat, the rest of the world seems a lot more sane and the messaging discussion has not been one, in a lot of places on earth for years now. Instead here we are in 2017, with americans ranting about SMS and 'the imessage for android'. Something most nations will not care about Santos Chavez I think a lot of has to do with the fact that many folks here aren't really technically knowledged. Most never use any other app other than what came with their phone. Hence why SMS is still a thing, they just use that app to communicate with everyone. By gradually moving things over to RCS, those same consumers would still benefit from advanced messaging even if they never change their app. Sprint is helping with that since they're installing Android Messages by default on all new phones, and they already support RCS. ThePublisher So Google will be able to read all texts... awesome... Erstam Why don't they have Google voice setup with this already? James Where does it say Jibe will provide the hub connection to carriers for free? davidtb I could see how Google (a non-carrier) would want a piece of every RCS message (via their servers) who's at the center of the hub? RCS is pretty, but not a necessity, needa I wonder if Google is going to let everyone in the hub get the data. Yuri Vidal Can someone please explain me why use RCS (Or even SMS) would be better than simply using internet IP messaging systems? (WhatsApp, Telegram, Hangout, and so many others...) Paul Hansen A universal platform for all mobile devices. Not just the ones with a particular app installed. Santos Chavez Because then you could message someone the same way as those apps, but it wouldn't even matter what app they're using. For example, SMS apps will adopt the standard, as well (Textra devs have already said they will support it) so an Android Messages user on Sprint would be able to RCS with a Textra user on Rogers while having the same exact features of WhatsApp, Facebook, etc (like read receipts, typing indicators, large video sending, high quality pictures, and so on). Believe it or not, not everyone uses those other apps, especially here in the US. And even if they had an account in one or more of the apps, they may not be active on it anymore, like it is the case with my friends. With RCS you'd still be able to reach them anyway and have all of the advanced features those apps provide, across carriers and across apps. 2 Men-E I just want this to come to Project Fi Santos Chavez Me too! Really hoping that because Google owns the infrastructure and that they've streamlined the requirements to bridge to other carriers, it'll come to Fi pretty soon. Should be lots easier for them than all of the other carriers anywhere, after all :P Sonic Sunglasses I'm sure AT$T is busy working out its strategic plan to be dead last in implementing this technology. KChristainsen So basically we're still far off from RCS becoming a reality, unreal Jeff Saul Everything goes through the Google. It has been decreed. Humans will bow down to the Google. The Google reigns supreme. Soraya Xel For Google's next trick: Steal everyone's SMS data too. xyz No big deal. In most countries, the telecom regulators will set a standard that all carriers will have to follow. In the US, it'll be a mess. Đức Thành This is always the case: Google wants to help make something better for everyone, they have an idea that can help people improve things for themselves, which then more often than not gets rejected because everyone is a selfish and foolish asshole whose only interest is their own short-term benefits. Much of humanity is like that. Sometimes I think I can begin to get why in sci-fi movies the supreme AI ruler just wants to get rid of all humanity: Humanity's stupidity is a threat to their very existence.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Google launches Android O Developer Preview 3 with final APIs Emil Protalinski@EPro June 8, 2017 11:02 AM Image Credit: Screenshot Google today launched the third Android O developer preview, available for download now at developer.android.com and via the Android Beta Program. The preview includes an updated SDK with system images for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, and the official Android Emulator, and there’s even an emulator for testing Android Wear 2.0 on Android O. The big highlight with this preview is that the Android O APIs are now final. Google launched the first Android O developer preview in March and the second developer preview in May at its I/O 2017 developer conference. Google is planning to release one more preview with near-final system images in July and has slated the final version for release “later this summer” (in Q3 2017). Android O offers of a slew of new features including background limits, notification channels and dots, Autofill APIs, Picture in Picture, XML font resources, downloadable fonts, emoji compatibility, autosizing textview, adaptive icons, Webview enhancements, AAudio API, high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs, wide-gamut color for apps, and Google Play Protect, as well as Java 8 APIs and runtime optimizations. Google is also promising OS optimizations that should lead to faster boot times and smoother apps. Developer Preview 3 includes the latest version of the Android O platform with the final API level 26 and “hundreds of bugfixes and optimizations.” You can download the final API 26 SDK from the SDK Manager in Android Studio and Android Support Library 26.0.0 beta 2 from Google’s Maven repository — remember to update your project’s compileSdkVersion to API 26. This should give developers everything they need to develop and test their apps for Android O (migration guide). If you have existing code using Android O preview APIs, you may want to look at the diff report to see where your code might be affected. You can now also develop for Android O using Android Studio 2.3.3 from the stable channel. Until now, you needed Android Studio 3.0 Canary 1. Last but not least, you can now publish APK updates compiling with, and optionally targeting, API 26 to your Google Play alpha, beta, or even production channels. Publishing O-targeted apps during the preview lets developers test compatibility on existing devices and push updates to devices running API 26 (such as users in the Android Beta program).

On a day to day basis, your phone is subjected to all types of abrasive materials, hard surfaces, accidental spills, random things in your pocket/bag etc. It is for this very reason that I simply must have a case on my device at all times. Let’s look at phone protection from another perspective: When you purchase a device, it is an important investment. This phone will at some point or another be sold, given to a family member, or no longer used after a period of time. If you’re like me and tend to go through many devices, then you want to keep them as pristine as possible. I generally sell my devices when I’m done using them, otherwise I would accumulate a ton of them and spend more on new ones. Phones that are kept in better condition will always sell for more money, effectively saving you from paying as much for your next device. If you’ve read any of my many reviews that have been posted over the years on XDA, you certainly know how much I enjoy phone cases. I tend to go through a variety of styles, companies, and protection levels just to find the perfect ones. I work in the energy sector, which is probably the worst field if you want to keep your devices in good condition. I routinely go out to field locations during less than ideal weather, with tons of dirt, chemicals, and other things that could be my phone's worst nightmare. When I’m not out in the field, I don’t want to carry around a gigantic brick of a case. I usually aim to have something a little more practical for the office. Speck Presidio Grip Only one company can pack style, protection, and grip into a streamlined case that doesn't make compromises. Speck crafted this handsome case out of their proprietary IMPACTIUMTM and some type of plastic for the rear shell. Verizon and Speck sell the case for $39.99 which is on the higher end for most cases in this category. You may be able to get it cheaper on Amazon, however (5" Pixel version here). The Good Design Excellent protection in a slim package. Grips Nothing beats the excellent grip, and unique styling it gives to the Presidio. The Not So Good Color Only one color option for the Pixel XL. Price Speck is charging a premium for their case. Speck is one of the many well-known case manufacturers and tends to be popular. Their cases offer great protection and grip, all inside a smaller profile than something like an Otterbox. I was excited to see Speck give Google’s Pixel/Pixel XL the special treatment by offering up a few varieties of their great cases. Recently, Speck completely redesigned their flagship Candyshell case line, and rebranded it as the Presidio. The new Presidio line offers all of the same great things you’d expect from the Candyshell with a matte finish, better resistance to scratches, thinner profile, and more cohesive colors. There’s just something about having a matte finish that really looks great. I have a Quite black Pixel XL (I’ll use the word Pixel interchangeably for my Pixel XL) and the black Presidio Grip seamlessly combines to give you a fantastic looking setup. Each cutout on the case looks precise, isn’t oversized, and really makes you feel like it is a tailored suit for your phone. Accessing Google’s new fingerprint scanner is even easier when using this case because of the seamless bevel around the cutout. The stock USB A-C, and C-C cables fit perfectly, as do all of my aftermarket ones from Tronsmart, Choetech, i-Orange, and other companies. You can press each button and still be greeted by that satisfying tactile ‘click’ that makes you forget the phone is even inside a case. When it comes to drop protection, Speck historically has fared well and lived up to the 10’ drop test claim on their website. I’ve personally dropped my Nexus 6P using the older Candyshell Grip from close to that height without it hurting my phone whatsoever. The case will show some damage without it translating to your phone. I also use a Candyshell Grip with my work iPhone 6 instead of the provided Otterbox Commuter for personal reasons. Since it is a work phone, I try to keep it in good shape, although it has seen a few falls in the office and out in the field. Another great mention is the new lifetime warranty that covers workmanship and materials under normal use. Now, I know some people will ask what exactly do the seemingly vague statements cover; I will give you an example of a warranty-covered issue I experienced with my S7 Edge Candyshell Grip. The S7 Edge was already an odd phone due to the dual edge display. This presented problems for case companies because it meant making the edges thinner to accommodate the phone. I had my Speck case crack right under the volume rockers from removing it multiple times. I contacted Speck, sent them a picture, copy of my receipt, and they replaced it without a hassle. I was allowed to keep the old broken one even though I had no use for it. To date, I have not found a better case for my Google Pixel XL despite a plethora of them being currently available. (Note: The smaller dedicated cutout that houses the laser, and microphone can accumulate dust. Some people mentioned this causing auto focus issues due to the sensor being covered by dirt/lint/dust. Since the area is harder to clean, you may need to use compressed 'canned air' or remove the phone and wipe off that area periodically). Otterbox Defender Otterbox offers a more industrial themed case that combines function, and protection without considering looks. The case usually sells for $59.99 direct from Otterbox's website, or other retailers including Verizon. Amazon does sell the Pixel Defender (5" version here), but you may have a limited choice of colors for the XL. The Good Holster This addition really makes carrying the phone a lot easier on top of adding more protection. Ports Port covers help add protection to an otherwise ignored area by most companies. The Not So Good Size Let's be honest with ourselves, the sheer size of the Defender makes it almost unwieldy. Weight Make no mistake on top of the case being the size of a brick, it also weighs about as much. If you ask anyone what they think the best rugged phone case is they will tell you to get a Otterbox, more specifically their Defender. This marks the first time that Otterbox (the company that also owns Lifeproof) has made a case for a Google device. Like Speck, Otterbox is very selective when it comes to the companies they partner with for cases. Otterbox prides themselves on their Defender series, the tests they subject it to, and their unique drop standard. From the consumer perspective, you cannot compare their standard to the relatively loose Mil-STD 810G without conducting it yourself. When I was active duty in the Marine Corps, most people I knew used an Otterbox. I always asked people why they bothered when it just adds bulk. The response was “it’s better” or “I need a heavy duty case." Both of these ‘requirements’ can be easily met by many other cases on the market. I always used a Speck case, even during my deployment back in 2010-2011; I have never broken a phone’s screen, or a phone while using a case. There haven’t been a whole lot of changes in their flagship brick case, or their Defender series. The case is still oversized almost to a comedic point, and features one of the most frustrating systems to install on your phone. I was very hesitant when I first saw their Pixel XL cases because I don’t need that much bulk, and what trivial extra protection it might give you. When you look at their Defender case it’s hard to imagine why they wouldn’t just use a similar methodology to Speck or Tech 21 with a thin, very protective case. I bought this for work, primarily for when I’m out in the field, yet I don't see the point. Otterbox does have a few things going in their favor that most others don’t offer. Otterbox uses port covers on their Defender case so you can protect the ‘ugly’ Pixel/Pixel XL from getting dirt in it. For the record, I like the design of Google’s Pixel line; it takes a while to adjust to, but it’s a unique-looking design on the backside. I was pleasantly surprised when I pressed the buttons on my Otterbox case and was greeted with a tactile ‘click.’ I had a less pleasant experience using Otterbox's cases with my S7 Edge where the buttons felt like trying to use a rusty typewriter. Most cables should work with the case (headphones too) unless you’re using some beastly audiophile aux cable or 0 gauge USB-C cable. Outside, you will find the soft feeling rubber/TPU material that seems to resist oils and marks well. I can’t say the same for the plastic parts. Using the fingerprint scanner is sort of easier due to the long ramp that guides your index finger into place. As with all things on this case, the bevel around the sensor is complete overkill, sticking with the company's industrial design. There is some great attention to detail on the inner plastic shell where Otterbox put a thin (almost foam feeling) liner that helps distribute the shock from a drop over your phone. A built-in screen protector is a very polarizing feature on this case; I personally have a few choice words for it. I removed mine in favor of the glass screen protector currently on my Pixel, since you cannot use both. If you decide to use the built-in screen protector, know that it scratches very fast, has an affinity for oils/dirt, and doesn’t like to wipe clean. I experienced no issues fitting the case using my glass screen protector. A lot of cases lately have such tight tolerances that you can’t even use a vinyl skin, like the ones dbrand sells. Lastly, one of my favorite things about this case is the included belt clip that also protects your screen (when in the clip). More often than not, you’re going to want to carry the Pixel in the provided belt clip as it might get mistaken for a brick if you work in construction. Most belts should work with the clip from what I can tell. I measured it at ~1.75in, so I would recommend a belt that is 1.5in at the most. I haven’t decided the fate of my Otterbox Defender yet; it might get used a lot, or just collect dust on my desk until I feel a need for it. Spigen Rugged Armor The Rugged Armor case from Spigen has become a staple in their product line by offering drop protection, unique styling, at an affordable price. Spigen always sells their cases on their website and eBay store, but it can also be found for $13.99 (as I'm writing this) on Amazon. The Good Size Spigen made a compelling case with a slimmer profile than their competitors without compromising drop protection. Buttons The serrations on the power button really are icing on the case. The Not So Good Color Unlike Spigen's other cases, the Rugged Armor is only offered in black. Spigen isn’t what I would directly call a household name unless you primarily order your accessories online. Most companies that sell cases online only have a harder time reaching out to customers in the same way that Speck, Otterbox, Incipio, or other brands would. I haven’t seen Spigen cases sold in stores myself, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t sold in store somewhere. Spigen is able to reach people better even with no big presence in your typical electronics or carrier stores. They constantly have sales online, promote their products, and more importantly make a large variety of cases for just about every flagship. I first encountered their cases back with my Note 3. At the time I bought the NeoHybrid and never looked back. Over the years their cases have evolved into a more diverse lineup with a few exceptions. They have some cases that are hard to tell apart which confuses consumers. An example of this is their Slim Armor/Tough Armor series. The Slim Armor (SA) is always better compared to the Tough Armor (TA), and while they look nearly identical, the TA is bulkier and has worse button feedback. There are a few lines they offer that I have an affinity toward: the Rugged Armor, Thin Fit, and Slim Armor. I’ve had more good experiences with these cases than some others making them a first purchase when I get a phone. I currently have their Rugged Armor (RA) case for my Pixel. It took me a while longer to get one; this was due to the RA frequently going out of stock on Amazon because of the popularity of the design. Spigen opted for a carbon fiber-ish bottom, supplemented by a horizontally grooved region at the top covering where Google has the glass back. The [somewhat] fingerprint-resistant TPU construction gives you a pleasant soft-touch like feeling when you hold it, despite not having any real grip. Don’t be fooled by the thin profile of this case, because Spigen claims it can take a beating. I’ve dropped my phones (S7 Edge, HTC 10, Nexus 6P, Note 7) in this case more times than I care to mention and never broken a screen or had any damage to my phone. TPU is a great material for absorbing shocks, maintaining its shape over time, and resisting oils /scratches to some extent. The case is said to go through 26 drops from 4 ft (48 in), thereby offering “Military grade” protection. I mentioned in my Otterbox review that bulky cases are more of a style than anything given how cases like this one, and the Presidio, offer equal protection the majority of the time. My favorite part of this case has to be the textured power button. Spigen did the same thing with their HTC 10 version of the Rugged Armor, but not with any other phone’s RA that I’ve seen. The feeling of the serrations will make you crave member berries, as it feels like you are using the phone caseless without any harm coming to it. This makes the transition to the RA not as bad. I know some people hate cases on their phones—if you’re one of those people, give this case a try. It offers a thin profile, protective design, and doesn’t interfere with any functionality whatsoever. Pressing the buttons on this case feels no different than using the phone without one, aside from the subtle softer TPU vs. metal on the phone. I highly recommend this case second only to the Presidio at the moment. There can be a lot of trial and error when finding the right case, but you won’t have that if you buy the RA. (Note: The smaller dedicated cutout that houses the laser, and microphone can accumulate dust. Some people mentioned this causing auto focus issues due to the sensor being covered by dirt/lint/dust. Since the area is harder to clean, you may need to use compressed 'canned air' or remove the phone and wipe off that area periodically). Pixel XL Case by Google - Clear Google's case is only sold through their online store for a rather expensive $30 given what is being offered. The case features a very simple two-tone clear color scheme on the back and is made out of polycarbonate like most other clear cases. The Good Looks Google made a nice looking case if you enjoy the almost two-tone color scheme of the Pixel. Support Anything bought from the Google Store always comes with the best support if you have any issues later down the line. The Not So Good Protection Unlike last year's offerings, there isn't much in the form of protection offered by this case. Design The clear 'windowed' region suffers from rainbowing due to the poor design. Then you're left with no protection for the top or bottom of your Pixel. Google first introduced its own phone cases starting back with the Nexus 5 (I could be mistaken). There was a mixed reaction, mainly due to the much higher prices, delays, and rather mediocre quality at times. Each new Nexus device thereafter would have its own generation (style) of case in the Google Store. I never owned a Nexus 5 because at that time I bought my first true phablet, the Note 3. I also used a Nexus 7 (2013) model while at school for some of my text books and other things. Google made a bumper case for the Nexus 7 that seemed to have its fair share of issues, such as the color rubbing off onto the tablet. Things changed with the Nexus 6 case which was made by CaseMate, as was their Project Fi case, if you were lucky enough to get one. These cases were still way overpriced relative to some other alternatives, on top of their already questionable design/quality. Following the 6, Google’s Nexus 5X/6P received a little more special treatment with their cases. Adopted is a company based in NY that primarily makes iPhone cases (gasp). This lineup offered better quality, unique Google-inspired designs, and a premium price to suit. I owned the clear and the felt-like backed grey one. These cases showed a big step forward compared to earlier years despite some small issues. Google went a step further many months after the phones launched with their Live Cases. Both my wife and I owned these with mixed results: Hers fit perfectly and looked great. Mine on the other hand was loose, creaked horribly, and the picture was nowhere near clear. I might have Artem’s luck with these things. I decided to get the “Made by Google” clear case for my Pixel XL this year. On their website, the pictures are deceiving because you cannot tell whether the top and bottom are protected (they’re not). I was disappointed when I opened my brand new Quite Black Pixel XL and case, only to be greeted with something that I would personally never use—there was a total lack of top/bottom coverage. I enjoy thin cases such as Spigen’s thin fit, and Ringke’s Slim series, but only when they offer top/bottom coverage. I decided to try the case anyway since I already bought it. However, things didn’t get better for Google’s latest case offering. If you look at the back, you’ll notice it has a frosted bottom and clear top corresponding to where the glass window is on the Pixel. I think this design looks good, as do other case manufacturers since they implemented a similar design of their own. The clear back region covering the Pixel’s glass is just as big of a fingerprint magnet, if not bigger than the glass itself. I also experienced a large amount of rainbowing when the case was on because it touched the glass. Google didn’t think that design through as they should have. Conventionally, cases will use a ‘micro-dot’ pattern to keep the plastic a hair off the glass; so this issue doesn’t occur like it does with other cases. The issues kept getting worse when I noticed a lot of scratches on the inside of the case from where I cleaned it with a microfiber cloth. There was no dust or dirt on it when I cleaned it. There is a trivial lip that keeps your display raised off hard surfaces, yet if you intend to use this case, should that even matter? One good thing Google did was make the buttons accessible, at least enough where I didn’t have any glaring issues hitting the power/volume keys. I believe Google needs to make a good case that doesn’t suffer from these abundant problems year after year, especially when launching a whole ‘new’ line of devices. I wouldn’t recommend buying the clear case (I cannot speak about their other case’s quality) unless you enjoy throwing money away for something that won’t protect your phone any more than using a dbrand skin. Ringke Fusion Clear cases are a popular way to show off your beautiful phone. Ringke offers interesting cases that fit this need for a reasonable price. They can be found on Ringke’s website or on Amazon for $20 or less depending on the day. The Good Looks This case will look great if you plan on using a dbrand skin to eliminate the rainbow streaking. Ports Ringke removed all port covers making the case easier to use on top of looking better. The Not So Good Design The lanyard hole is a blackhole for dirt to enter your case. Design The transparent polycarbonate back panel doesn't use microdots therefore suffers from the dreaded rainbow effect. Ringke (also known as Rearth USA) is another company that makes a very popular array of cases. Their collections include the Ringke Slim and Fusion series, both of which I’ve been using for quite some time. Depending on your phone, Ringke has a broad assortment of styles, materials, and colors. Unfortunately, only one case has been made for the Pixel/Pixel XL so far: the Fusion. If I were to think back to the early days of my Nexus 6P, there were only a few decent clear cases out there; one of my favorites was the Fusion. My first Ringke case was a Ringke Slim that I bought for my favorite phone of all time, Google’s Nexus 6. The sheer size of the device was great, and even more manageable with a thin case from Ringke. I appreciated their attention to detail with the inclusion of top and bottom coverage, unlike some other thin-fitting cases back then. The Ringke Slim and Fusion cases both took a beating during their time on my Nexus 6—even some hard falls onto the pavement that left lasting marks on the plastic. My Nexus 6 never had so much as a scratch on it despite the very minimal design of both cases. In my opinion, the protection you get boils down to a few basic things: design, materials, and coverage. Neither case was what I would call bulky, yet the right combination of those variables gave my phone adequate protection. I opted for a Smoke colored Fusion to compliment the Quite Black Pixel XL. There’s something about this combination that gives the phone a stunning appeal. Outside the Fusion is a TPU-based bumper fused to the polycarbonate back panel. This was done to give you the best transparency, while still having flexibility for impacts and removing the case. Some changes were made to the design from last year. First, the infamous port covers Ringke used on their Fusion line are now gone with the wind. Second, Ringke found a way to avoid the scratch mark around the fingerprint cutout. This was a big concern among Nexus 6P case buyers last year; I spoke with an individual who detailed the cause of this defect. When the cases are made via injection molding or other methods, there is a large amount of heat. As the polycarbonate cools, air pockets can form in a long and narrow fashion stemming from the fingerprint cutout. From a consumer perspective, it looks like a scratch, yet this was a manufacturing issue. The following areas of the case stayed the same despite not serving any real function for most people. There is a small lanyard hook at the bottom of all Ringke cases; maybe it’s a trademark design, or they just felt like adding one. This presents a large issue for their clear cases because it allows dust, dirt, and everything in between to get inside your nice clear case. Unlike their Air series, Ringke did not opt for a micro bubble texture on the clear region, resulting in what looks like an oil spill. As I mentioned in the Google Clear Case review, there is rainbowing on any place a polycarbonate section touches the glass. This is especially true with the large region covered by this case. I tried to carefully put the case on without pressing on that area, only to be met with gigantic rainbow effects. Dirt is this case’s worst nightmare, as all of it shows easily because the whole back touches the phone. Every tiny piece of lint and dust will show through the case. I carefully removed all the dust, used a can of air, then briskly placed the phone inside. To my frustration, dust still managed to find its way in. I wouldn’t even consider placing this phone inside my work laptop bag because I know it would come out looking like I took it from a dusty closet. On a more positive note, Ringke claims the Fusion offers MIL-STD 810G drop protection, making it just as protective as the Speck, Spigen, and Otterbox. This same protection is also offered by the fragile yet sleek looking V20, so keep that in mind. No one verifies the case lives up to that standard other than the company making the claim, but I don’t doubt the Fusion’s protection whatsoever. Some standards such as the MIL-STD 810G seem easy to meet if you engineer your case correctly. I believe Ringke needs to work on addressing the rainbow issue, and in doing so they will fix my other complaint regarding the dust through the addition of micro dots. As of right now, I wouldn’t recommend their case until something is done to fix this. Incipio Dual Pro When it comes to color, Incipio has your phone covered with their Dual Pro. Gold, red, and black all are offered in a nice looking case that can be found on Amazon, Incipio's website, and Verizon for around $35 or less. The Good Color Incipio chose to offer some nice colors compared to other companies. Buttons All the buttons are very responsive and easy to find. The Not So Good Size The choice of materials here likely led to this case being larger than it should have been. Cutouts For some reason Incipio chose to make their cutouts on the back so large that even my Otterbox Defender’s look small. Incipio makes cases for everything from smartphones to laptops, giving them a very diverse background. As with most other case manufacturers, Incipio primarily caters toward Apple products, which can be seen with their excessive selection of cases offered for each Apple device. During my last year in school I owned a Surface Pro 4 and housed it inside an Incipio case. I tend to be overly OCD/cautious when it comes to electronics, hence why all my phones, tablets, and devices have been inside a case since day one. While Incipio doesn’t offer a wide selection of cases for Google’s Pixel line, they do have a few good choices. I was surprised to see more cases being offered compared to last year’s Nexus 6P, which was only given one case and color, while the 5X had a slightly better lineup. I’ve owned both the Octane and Dual Pro cases for previous phones, but I haven’t tried the Carnaby yet. The Dual Pro features a hard shell Incipio calls “Plextonium,” which is still just polycarbonate as they denote on their website. Silicone is used inside (I always thought it was a softer TPU/TPE), so reading that was certainly interesting. Silicone is not ideal for cases because it will stretch out over time, as Otterbox, Seidio, and other companies have come to find out. Most cases use TPE/TPU for its favorable properties, including retaining shape better even after removing your phone countless times. I’ve never had a Spigen case become loose over time, yet all my silicone ones have. An interesting tidbit: only the black model has a soft touch finish to it. I don’t know if this is by design, or the way they finish the black one. I could only find a gaudy gold case when I bought my Pixel XL. I usually don’t care about the color if the case does its job. The gold does a decent job hiding fingerprints. This is unlike the black one, which is a magnet for oils and dirt. Compared to Dual Pro cases in the past, this one is exceptionally thick—and no, that’s not a good thing. I don’t see this case offering any more protection due to the added thickness. Rather, I feel it’s due to the use of silicone as opposed to TPU. Aside from the bulk, I can’t say I appreciate the larger fingerprint/camera cutouts. I’ve already noticed scratches on my fingerprint scanner, so any more exposed glass through the back is not something I want. I did order a skin to cover just the glass, but that won’t be here for about a week. Some of this added bulk might be a good thing because of the case’s slippery texture. Just about every negative thing I’ve mentioned is more about me being a very picky person than there being something inherently flawed about the case’s design. There are several positive aspects of this case, such as the few color options (gold/black/red). The latter isn’t nearly as common these days. If you plan to keep your phone in this case without removing it more than a few times, I don’t see the silicone losing its shape as much over time. It is ultimately up to you when deciding which case to use. Tech 21 Evo Check Simple, elegant protection is what Tech 21 offers all without any added bulk or fancy marketing. You can purchase the Evo Check case from Tech 21's website, or from Verizon currently unless Amazon decides to stock it in the near future. The Good Design I don’t think there’s a way to look at this case and say it’s ugly. The checkered back looks stunning from all angles. Protection All good things can also come in a well-designed, sleek case with the benefit of great drop protection. The Not So Good Buttons Trying to push the power button is like trying to move a building. It won’t budge without a ton of force. Cutouts Tech 21’s choice for a precise fingerprint cutout and a large camera cutout confuses me. Why wouldn’t they stick to precision for both? I prefer cases that offer good drop protection and a slimmer profile, as I’m sure most readers will have noticed at this point. I chose the Tech 21 case because it was well suited to offer protection all with a nice looking low-profile design. My experiences with Tech 21 only date back to when I bought my S7 Edge earlier this year. I found their case to be great in many areas, particularly with handling drops. Their claim to fame seems to be how well the cases hold up to drops while still protecting the phone/tablet inside. I’ve seen many YouTube videos showing someone drop the case off a balcony onto concrete/pavement with no damage to the phone. I would never test this myself, and I do not recommend ever doing so because anything is possible. Tech 21 offers a few styles in their EVO line that all look too similar for most people to tell apart. They have the Evo Check, Evo Check Active, Evo Elite, Evo Gem, Evo Tactical, etc. Only the Evo Check is offered for Google’s Pixel line. Even though each style looks similar, their functions are different. Each case relies primarily on a material they call “FlexShock,” which is another fancy way of saying some sort of TPU/TPE material. One thing I will say about their materials is how hard they feel relative to other cases. They might be using a higher density form of TPU/TPE to protect the phone against larger drops. I opted for a Black/Smoke Evo Check case since my Pixel XL is Quite black. The contrasting checkered pattern gives the phone a tactile or even stylish look. Physically, this case is only slightly larger than Spigen’s Rugged Armor, yet it claims to withstand bigger impacts. Inside, there are ribbed buffers lining the border along the sides; it then has thicker top/bottom sections that aide in impact absorption. I found the bottom thickness to be annoying at times because I rest my phone on my pinky, so these deeper cutouts started to hurt my finger after a while. The backside of each cutout is virtually flush with the phone to give you better access for charging and headphones. While their fingerprint cutout is great, I can’t say I appreciate how large the camera one is. I won’t say it hurts anything because it doesn’t, but precision is part of a case’s beauty when it’s this sleek. Speaking of sleek, you won’t find the Evo Check to offer much if any grip if that matters to you. Let’s talk about my biggest issue with this case: the power button. I was very pleased with both the volume keys after pressing them, then came the power button… I don’t know why it’s so damn hard to press or how they let it ship like this, but it’s a nightmare. I thought my first one was defective, so I swapped it out only to find the same issue. The button simply doesn’t want to move when you press it. I’m currently using the case with the hope that prolonged use will cause the button to break in somehow. If Google made a native way to turn off my screen via the fingerprint scanner I would do that, but unfortunately only 3rd party apps can do that so far. This would solve the power button issue during normal usage, but it doesn’t excuse the problem to begin with. Aside from my complaints with the awful power button, I find this case to be very pleasant during day-to-day usage. I will update this review later if the power button situation changes. Case By Google - Silicone Google is generally good at keeping things fresh. They have managed to continue that tradition by offering a wider variety of cases in a number of colors. The Silicone has many nice features, as well as a few flaws that may ultimately be the deciding factors for you. The Good Appearance The case has a sophisticated design that looks very professional. Cutouts Due to the open bottom, every USB accessory should fit without an issue. The Not So Good Texture It is very slippery and would be easy to drop. Material The silicone is bound to stretch with general wear and tear. Let me start by saying that this case is very simple and elegant. It does not try to be anything it’s not. There are no extra flourishes that make it seem too decorative, other than the “G” on the back (Google’s signature stamp). The Silicone case I was sent is grey, and this neutral tone gives me a more business-oriented vibe. I can picture it sitting on an executive’s desk during his coffee break. However, looks are not the most important thing. Google chose to make this from a conglomerate of three materials: it has a polycarbonate shell wrapped in soft silicone, which is then lined with a velvety microfiber. This combination gives the case a very sleek feeling, but at a price. It is so slick it could slide across sandpaper. Some areas are not reinforced properly, allowing the silicone to pull away from your phone around the buttons. Unlike Google’s Clear Case, this one covers the top of the phone and leaves the bottom out in the cold. Since the case is so slippery, there is greater risk for damage if you should drop it. If dropping is not a concern for you, the fact that the buttons are almost impossible to find may be. The buttons on this case are practically ghosts. If you go to push the power or volume buttons, you may wonder whether they are there or not. When you do manage to find them there is a good tactile response. It is a combination of the smooth texture and nearly flush edges that make them hard to locate. If Google were to make one change to the buttons, I would suggest giving them some kind of raised texture. If you are as anal as I am, the cutouts on Google’s Silicone case may be a nuisance to you. Given all the precise engineering that went into making this case, you would think the cutouts would have received the same treatment. The fingerprint cutout is perfectly fine, but the cutout for the camera is extremely large. It does not appear like it was measured to perfectly fit the Pixel camera. This extra open space allows more dirt to get on the lens, which is easily scratched. Since the purpose of a case is to protect your phone from damage, this seems like a major oversight. I have resorted to buying a vinyl skin that covers the glass to protect it while in such cases. If having a fashionable case with basic scratch protection is enough for you, then you will enjoy this case. If you do buy it, don’t drop it or have it on the counter while baking cookies. You’ll either end up with a broken phone or cleaning flour from your camera lens. SupCase Unicorn Beetle Despite what its name suggests, this case is not made of a casual greeting, a mythical creature, and an insect. The Supcase Unicorn Beetle is an example of a good case gone in the wrong direction. Imagine if General Mills took the marshmallows out of Lucky Charms...it’s that kind of direction. The Good Design The clear back is properly designed to eliminate rainbow streaking. Ports The charging and headphone cutouts are able to fit most cables without issue. The Not So Good Design The boxy design leaves a lot to be desired. Buttons The buttons are very hard to press the first time, even though they are easier to find than some other flush buttons. This case once had a lot of desirable features which have either disappeared or been altered completely. Previous case generations made holding it comfortable as the case mimicked the phone’s contours. In terms of shape, it is now very boxy. While the Otterbox is bigger, the Unicorn Beetle (UB) has a more cumbersome feel in your hand. The UB’s edges are very sharp, making it even more uncomfortable to hold. The look has also changed; the Nexus 6P generation UB had a frosted back, which has vanished from the new one. The only good thing about the clear back is that it doesn’t cause rainbow streaking, as it is lifted slightly off the phone. The major downside is that this allows dust to get onto your phone, defeating one of the points of using a case. The former frosted back was made from acrylic, but the new one appears to be made of polycarbonate. This gives it a more slippery feel, adding to the reasons why it is more difficult to hold. The almost good news about the buttons is that the power key is textured, so you actually know what you are pressing. On the other hand, when pushing the buttons, you need to push them toward the front of the phone; you can’t just push them straight in. The buttons are also flush, making it hard to tell where the volume rocker is. At least you’ll be able to distinguish it from the power button. Now, let’s talk about the cutouts. They are oversized, which again makes it easier for dirt to get on your phone. However, the large size of them keeps with the bulky, square theme of the case. While I am not a fan at them, I will say that they are consistent with the rest of the design. If uniformity is important to you, you’re in luck. Much like Lucky Charms without the Charms, this case has left me disappointed. The UB has removed all of the features that made it such a good case back in previous generations. What were once smooth contours that blended the back panel with the outer TPU bumper are now sharp edges. Additionally, poor design led to the use of buttons that are nearly impossible to find let alone press the first time. In my opinion, there are too many better competing cases on the market to justify using this one. Google Live Maps Case Live Cases, particularly the maps ones, have been popular since Google first released them last year. Google gave anyone the ability to create a one-of-a-kind case with limitless possibilities for customization. At $40 customization doesn’t come cheap, so putting a picture of your new girlfriend on it might be a bad idea. The Good Design Infinite customizability allows you to have a truely unique case. Software The accompanying app ensures your phone's wallpaper can be as unique as its exterior. The Not So Good Buttons Despite the good intentions behind Google's NFC button, it falls short in real word use. Color Colors when you order may not match your actual case as I found out. There are many color and ‘texture’ options offered by Google for their maps case that are not entirely accurate when you physically get your case. I ordered this maps one in what I thought was a deep indigo, yet when I received the case it was a very light periwinkle. This was disappointing for me given the blatant color differences, especially the indigo. I checked the color on a few different screens (not the oversaturated AMOLED on my Pixel) to be sure. Aside from the colors looking like a faded pair of jeans, not the dark wash expected, the case was as I ordered. While Google’s two other cases have a larger cutout for the camera module, and sensor array, this one has precise holes for each. If I were to speculate, Google did this to maximize the area for printing the image onto the case. Since the entire case is crafted from polycarbonate, the volume/power buttons received cutouts, otherwise they would be unusable. On the inside you will find an NFC antenna linked to the large indent at the case's center. Google refers to this as a programmable shortcut button, although that terminology is a little misleading. The NFC antenna isn’t contacting the Pixel’s rear glass until you apply a lot of pressure to that spot on the case. Once contact has been made, the Pixel will read the NFC antenna, and do whatever task you assigned to it. A nifty, simple companion app was created to control, program, and otherwise play with the Live Case. One neat feature all Live Cases have is a unique wallpaper that matches your case. Maps cases will allow you to see the local map around you in any color array offered for the case. These wallpapers also scroll nicely with the Pixel Launcher, and can be alternatively used as a fixed image. Style, scratch protection, and the cool factor are about all you can expect from any Live Case. There is a very slight lip for face down protection, and both the top/bottom are exposed. I personally don’t mind those drawbacks given how Google doesn’t intend for their Live Cases to offer real protection. Personal expression in the form of cases is expensive no matter what Live Case you choose. I can’t say whether or not $40 is worthwhile for most people, but for me it’s certainly not. Between the inaccurate colors and almost useless NFC button, Google has a lot to work on for future live cases. Diztronic Pixlee If you ever find yourself missing those old pixelated video games from the late eighties and early nineties, you may like the Diztronic Pixlee. At $10 and in a variety of colors what's not to like about this case? While it has its flaws in terms of protection and design, it is overall a whimsical case that will make you want to break out your old Nintendo. The Good Design It has an attractive design and easy-to-find buttons. Colors Diztronic offers a multitude of colors for your retro inspired needs! The Not So Good Materials It is not very sturdy and has a large camera cutout. Durability As with previous Diztronic cases the sides will loosen up over time making the case unusable. Why does this case make me so nostalgic for a simpler time? The answer is in the look. The Pixlee has a design that quite literally looks like little pixels you may have seen on an old computer. This design also gives it a rougher texture, allowing you to keep a firm grip on it. While I am describing the black one, it comes in a variety of colors for you to choose from including orange, and pink. In terms of functionality, the Diztronic Pixlee has its pros and cons. Allow me to start with the positive and work my way down. The buttons are very nice and easy to push. Unlike buttons on some of the other cases I will be discussing, they are simple to find without having to visually search for them. In terms of the negative, the case is very flimsy. It will likely not shield your phone from much damage in the event of a drop. However, this may be moot, considering the rough texture should help prevent it from slipping out of your hand. Something else that may be considered a negative quality is the single, large cutout for the camera. It takes away from the otherwise preciseness of the case and could allow dirt to get around the camera glass. Lastly, Diztronic cases have been known to lose their shape over time thus becoming almost useless. I encountered this with 2 of their Nexus 6P cases, and my Nexus 6 one prior to that. To put it simply, this case is very pretty. It has a design that I believe most people would enjoy, and you can pick from an assortment of color options. Despite a few minor flaws, the Pixlee is a case worth trying out. Spigen Slim Armor At first glance, the Spigen Slim Armor looks something like an android from Star Wars (this is good news if you’re into that kind of thing). This is a great looking case that is more than thick enough to give your phone the proper armor before doing battle with your floor. Like every case, however, there are good and bad things about the Slim Armor even for the $30 you'll pay to get one. The Good Design The Slim Armor has an appealing design and has buttons that are easy to find and press. Features Spigen's small kickstand holds the Slim Armor up better than its bigger brother. The Not So Good Features The bottom is quite slippery and the kickstand pops out easier than it should. Color There are only a handful of color options, none of which are particularity great. In terms of the way this case looks and feels, there is a major textural difference between the black top and the silver (gunmetal) or black bottom. If you are like most people, your hold your phone more toward the bottom end. This is where there is slight problem with this case. The silvery bottom (the magical element that gives it that robot look) is very slippery, while the top is not. The kickstand also easily comes off, though it is not clear if this has something to do with the weak plastic retainer. All of my previous Slim Armor cases made popping out the kickstand a nightmare, thus maybe Spigen addressed the issue. This smoothness may make it more likely that your phone will slide from your hand. Although, I suppose they call it “Armor” for a reason, as this thing could really take a pounding. If it is not yet clear, design and functionality are really intertwined with this case. The buttons are raised appropriately, so you won’t find yourself feeling around for your volume buttons like you are trying to read Braille. It has smaller cutouts for the camera and flash, which adds to the sleekness and will help minimize the amount of dust and dirt that can damage the glass. Previous Next Ultimately, this case is like the little black dress of cases according to my wife. It is versatile and can take your phone from a professional to a casual setting. While it's slippery due to the contrast in textures, damage should still be minimized in the event you drop your phone down a few flights of stairs. The Spigen Slim Armor really is armor for your phone. Spigen Tough Armor Well, not all Armor is created equal. Some phone accessories really should not have been made to begin with, and the Spigen Tough armor would be at the top of that list for me. Despite a few redeeming qualities, you may want to save your money on this one. If you really want to buy the case it can be found on Amazon for ~$18. The Good Design Texture is easy to grip (black one), and it looks better than its clear counterpart. Ports Ample room was provided on both the top/bottom cutouts for your audiophile and charging needs. The Not So Good Material Oil from your fingers will dirty the case, and good luck finding the buttons. Cutouts For some reason Spigen opted for a bizzare speaker cutout on the non-clear version only. Let me begin by discussing some production flaws and a couple of positive qualities. You all know my thing with buttons by now...these ones are extremely elusive. Not only do they not want to be found, but they do not want you to know which one is which. If the case itself could think, it probably would not even know they were there. The buttons on the clear one are even harder to find because of the smoother texture. They attempted to put a little dividing line between the power and the volume buttons, but it is a barely noticeable afterthought. What really bothers me is why Spigen still insists on making the Tough Armor when their Slim Armor is always better. Unlike the Slim Armor, the design on the Tough is somewhat boring. However, I will say it has a very grippy texture in addition to being sturdy. You should have no problem with your phone being damaged. Some more good-ish news is that the camera cutouts are the same shape as the Slim Armor (only a tiny bit smaller). It gives the phone a slightly more sleek look, and little to no dust should scratch your camera lens. The kickstand also seems to remain in place when you open and close it. The texture has a somewhat leathery feel, and is very absorbent. Don’t commit a crime while using this case, as your prints could easily be lifted off. If your only concern is with the fingerprints, then I would recommend the clear one; while it is clear around the very top and bottom, it has a smooth, silver back that does not dirty easily. Just be careful holding this one, as it would be easier to drop. Previous Next Spigen decided to make different speaker cutouts for the clear version in a good way. There are tiny slits above the speaker cutout normally which distort/muffle sound slightly, but this was fixed with the clear one. Design continuity should remain in place across a clear version of the same case, yet Spigen doesn’t seem to agree. While the Tough Armor was a fair attempt, I feel it is an example of why sometimes it is best to leave well enough alone. All it will take is a one-time use for you to realize that the Slim Armor is superior. Spigen NeoHybrid I am sure all of you know that looks can be deceiving, and the looks of the (~$15) Spigen NeoHybrid are just that. It will lure you in with a false sense of security until you actually touch it and put it on your phone. While appearing to be of high quality, it is actually quite cheap. The Good Style There is some color variety to choose from and it looks nice. Design Spigen's accent pattern follows Google's design language, and frankly is cool. The Not So Good Design It is flimsy and there is always a gap around the bumper when on your phone. Buttons The buttons sit flush with the bumper due to a design flaw. Apparently, some phone cases need bumpers...perhaps in case they fall down or bump into things. While the bumper offers a pleasing visual contrast to the body of the case, it presents a problem when you place it on your phone. No matter what you do, there will always be some sort of gap between the bumper and the actual case. This makes it so your case always looks cheap, and you will find yourself constantly fiddling with it in frustration. I wish that were the only issue. I haven’t seen a NeoHybrid fit perfectly since the days of my Note 3. While the buttons are properly raised to my liking, the case itself is very thin and poorly designed. Ideally, cases should be stiff so they can do their job. The NeoHybrid acts like it is made of rubber, and if you remove the bumper you can bend it in half without damaging it. Except unlike rubber, this case is not as durable (...and won’t bounce when you drop it)). I don’t feel comfortable allowing the thin plastic bumper to take any impact without suffering a lot of damage. One thing Spigen did right with this case has nothing to do with making it function better, but it is still worth noting. There is a textural difference between the top and bottom; the top has a raised design while the middle/bottom has a smoother texture. This adds to what is very “pretty” about this case. Putting the raised design on the bottom may have been more useful, as it would make the case less slippery while holding your phone. Do not judge a book by its cover. The NeoHybrid seems very nice and appealing, but it falls short everywhere else. LifeProof FRE LifeProof has finally given Nexus...umm, Pixel owners... a true water resistant IP68 case. (I say resistance because the IP rating is not a ‘waterproof’ standard). Google opted out of true water resistance on their flagship Pixel, leaving many users unhappy. This is where this LifeProof FRE case stepped in. Gone are the days of putting your phone in those awful pouches that render your phone useless. The case is sold through LifeProof's website for a rather pricey $89.99. The Good Design Excellent protection from dust and water thanks to its IP68 rating. Materials The durable exterior and reasonable screen protector make this a great case. The Not So Good Buttons These are by far the worst I’ve encountered on a case. Cutouts The speaker membrane hinders audio quality on an already quiet phone. When I heard LifeProof decided to take the plunge and make a Pixel/Pixel XL case, I was more excited than I care to explain. I need a good water/dust resistant case in my line of work, neither of which really existed for phones other than your usual Samsung/Apple flagships. There were a few select phones to receive the LifeProof treatment besides those, yet none were from Google’s former Nexus line... until now. My experience with LifeProof doesn’t go back as far due to the phones I’ve owned. The first one I bought was for my work-issued iPhone 6. Since earlier this year I’ve used the FRE on that phone without any big issues, other than some wear/tear from various drops its encountered. The case has held up well despite my less than gentle treatment of it. Moving on to this particular case, you will only find one color option so far (I hope that changes in the future). Even with the normal run of the mill black/grey styling, I’m happy this case exists at all. In the box, LifeProof includes some stickers, a small tool that aides in removal of the back, and a water resistant AUX extender. To maintain water resistance, there is a threaded portion inside the case and on the adapter alongside a small o-ring. I wasn’t able to fit a normal AUX cable into my phone without that adapter, not that I even use corded headphones these days. In the world we live in, dongles no matter their use have become a common site. Personally, I would rather not carry around extra gear if I don’t need. If you crave a larger phone, and miss the size of your Nexus 6, then you will be happy to know how large this case is. My Pixel is now thicker, and just as tall/wide as my LG V20 in a Speck Presidio Grip. The size of my V20 doesn’t bother me (hence why I own one), yet it can make your Pixel seem like a small brick. Size isn’t the only area of concern on this case. The buttons and speakers also have their own set of ‘problems’. Let’s face it, the Pixel has a quiet speaker if you even call it that. I rarely hear my alarm on it, let alone my ringtone. LifeProof used a membrane of sorts to protect the speaker, while still allowing sound to pass through (though muffled). I couldn’t watch a video or listen to music on my phone before with the low volume, now it’s a muffled mess. Don’t worry about trying to change the volume or shut off the phone inside this case; the buttons are basically glued in place. These might be the toughest buttons I’ve ever experienced. Oddly enough, my iPhone version works fine, even with the added resistance when pushing buttons. I appreciate the attention to detail LifeProof put into different aspects of the case. A grey trip wraps itself around the display, giving the case a nice transition into the black frame. Along the sides you will find a subtle grey trim accenting the case while also showing you where it splits apart. Other cases can make it difficult to find, wherein you need to remove a certain piece to get your phone. Thankfully, there are no issues with that here. Using the phone in the LifeProof case isn't difficult. In fact, I think it has a fairly decent built-in screen protector. Don’t expect to keep your beloved glass screen protector on in this case because it simply won’t fit. Fingerprint recognition has worked flawlessly for me even in this case, but gestures are another story. I can sometimes get the swipe gestures to work, but other times it’s a frustration-filled mess. That's a big deal to me, since I use gestures frequently. Given the Pixel’s excellent camera abilities, you should know how this case poses issues in that department. I found focusing to be inconsistent, and the plastic ‘lense’ on the case appeared to affect image quality. I ensured both my phone and case were clean beforehand; even then, results were mixed. With the many flaws I outlined, you might ask yourself why I still like this case. Nothing is perfect, or even close-- not even my Speck Presidio. The case might have its flaws, but I love it nonetheless. I can learn to work around some of the smaller more nitpicky things I mentioned because of the advantages LifeProof offers. Water/dust resistance are required when you live here in West Texas, and LifeProof provides them. Toast Wood (Walnut) ‘Case’ Toast has made a name for itself by offering laser cut real wood ‘cases’ for a multitude of phones, tablets, and PCs. Their cases are not conventional because they use adhesives to stay in place instead of friction. Currently, there are 3 woods offered (Walnut, Ash and Ebony) for more variety. The case I'm reviewing sells for $44 on Toast' website if you include the front panel, $34 without. The Good Design Nothing beats the elegant simplicity of wood. Customization Toast offers 3 different woods (Walnut, Ash, Ebony) along with custom laser engraving if you want to go that route. The Not So Good Design The fitment of certain areas could use a great deal of improvement. Materials Simple sanding, or rounding of the sharp edges would give this case a significantly better feel. Real material cases (wood, carbon fiber, leather etc.) are highly sought after as a luxury accessory by most people. I always enjoy a quality leather or wood case, mainly for the smell (leather), or feel (wood) because it offers something ‘fake’ materials cannot. I’ve tried real leather cases, skins, alongside a random wood one from other companies, I was generally pleased with the outcome, yet I could never use any of them for a prolonged period. While real wood/leather have their own appeal, they come with many drawbacks, too. Toast shares these drawbacks by using an adhesive instead of framing the wood into a case. Installation is no harder than doing a vinyl wrap or screen protector. I followed the instructions, and was able to have my phone covered in wood within 10 minutes. Aesthetically Toast nailed it, but the feel/durability is another story. Wood feels great most of the time, except with this case. I was constantly concerned about getting a splinter due to the rough texture and very sharp edges. Given all of the laser cut wood cases I’ve tried before where this wasn’t an issue, I started to question their intent. I understand how people enjoy a more rugged, natural feel, but there’s a difference between that and razor sharp edges. Some issues were encountered on the corner segments, as they did not fully adhere. I reached out to the Toast rep seeking advice on how to address this after installing my case. I will post an update about their response when representatives come back from the holiday break. Make no mistake when I say my Toast was installed perfectly, so I had an issue when my buttons became hard to press. Toast uses little pieces of wood that go over your buttons. I installed them with tweezers to ensure there was no misalignment whatsoever. I tried to hit my power button and was met with a very spongy response. Buttons should be tactile no matter what, and these lost their touch. Previous Next Another area Toast really could have improved on was their button texture. If Toast mimicked the texture on Google’s Pixel I would be much happier with the case. Finding buttons, let alone these slippery wood ones, was hard enough without any clear way of identifying one from another. Toast also included a front panel in their review sample I was sent. I chose not to install this because I’m using a glass screen protector, and the front wood piece is not compatible with it. Aside from my grips, the Toast still looked great as long as I didn’t use my phone. I cannot recommend their case in this state without some improvements, especially for what they’re charging. Incipio Octane One of my favorite S7 Edge cases made a return this time for the Pixel/Pixel XL. This simple frosted clear case with a selection of colored borders offers great drop protection without compromising style. Incipio offers 4 colors, (black, lavender, grey, pearl blue) all featuring the same frosted back panel. Amazon is the easiest place to purchase the case for around $25 right now in all of the color combinations. The Good Cutouts Adding a black border to the camera cutout eliminates flash issues. Design Frosted cases always have a nice cohesive look without the worry of smudges. The Not So Good Buttons Atrocious, horrible and other words would be a suitable description of how well the buttons do not function. Grip The Octane lost what little grip it had through the use of a different texture wrapping the sides. In the last generation of cases, there was a very nice, subtle tire-like pattern framing the case. This time we are met with a very rough, ribbed texture which detracts from the case's design. I never thought my S7 Edge version was particularly ‘grippy’ yet it was nowhere near as slippery as this one. Don’t let those deep grooves deceive you; even wrapping them in sand paper wouldn’t help. Looking at this case, you can really appreciate how well the two materials from the back and sides seamlessly blend together. Incipio plastered their logo rather obnoxiously on the back, reducing the overall appeal. I didn’t mind their logo as much before, but now it looks bigger, bolder, and more in the way. An inherent flaw of all frosted cases is how they can get scratched from the inside, which ruins their nice look. Inserting your phone in such a way to avoid scraping the back can be quite the challenge. I continued to look for some form of redeeming aspect of this case, only to be met with disappointment at every corner. I don’t know what buttons mean to Incipio because the ones on this case were essentially non-functional. LifeProof takes the cake (the cake is a lie...) for awful buttons, leaving Incipio firmly in second place. After an exhausting search, I found one area that Incipio designed well: cutouts. A lot of companies tend to overlook how clear cases will affect the camera, flash and other rear facing sensors. Incipio remedied this by using a black border around the larger camera cutout, eliminating any potential problem. My Pixel has issues focusing the majority of the time as it stands, even without a case. Thankfully, I did not run into this issue any more than usual while using the Octane. Larger accessory manufacturers can lose sight of what attributes made them successful; sadly, Incipio is the latest victim to this trend. Only a few companies have really stuck to their roots while improving their product line throughout the years. Both Incipio cases I’ve tried for my Pixel have been disappointing (the V20 ones weren’t any better either), as if they lost focus on what makes them great. This post will be continuously updated with more cases as I receive them. Here is a list of cases that will be added in the near future.

Should have put like a thin rubber coating on it to give it some grip. Jon Fridman I agree, that's why the Speck Presidio Grip is my go to case. Spigen has some advantages such as the size, and cost, but if those don't matter you can't go wrong with the Presidio. CJ Diztronic TPU cases have protected my phones over the last handful of years (on almost 2 handfuls of phones). At $10, they are precision cut and provide excellent protection. Downside is that there usually aren't many color choices. Daishi I love my Diztronic TPU cases. I have had them for my Galaxy Nexus, OG Moto X and my 2015 Moto XPE. Dropped each phone from about hip to chest high and no damage to any of those phones. CJ Jon: I've been eyeing the Caseology Vault case--I really like the looks of it. Have you ever tried one from that company? Jon Fridman I have owned a handful of Caseology cases over the years. I wasn't overly thrilled with their cases considering other brands offerings for the same price. CJ Thanks for weighing in on the Caseology brand! MJ I love my Spigen Rugged Armor case for my Pixel XL. You can't beat Spigen for the price. I will say my Really Black Pixel with a black case is boring looking so really hoping to see some case options with some color soon. Suicide_Note Same here. obk88 all you need is the rhino shield crashguard bumper MJ Yep...unless you actually care about your phone at all. Phones have backs which when dropped could be the impact spot. You do know the glass back on the Pixel also scratches easily right? Deathalo The back would be plenty protected if dropped on a relatively flat surface. You plan on smashing it up against a pointy rock? Oh and the same would apply to ANY case if dropped on the screen side, so what does it matter really? MJ People do drop their phones and they land/hit on a rock on the ground, the edge of a stair, or the corner of table. We don't live on a totally flat surface of a world. LOL Screen side? Common sense would dictate the more sides protected the better but screen protectors do exist. Did you miss the part where the back glass scratches real easy? People have been complaining it about all over the web. Anything else I can explain for you? San Diego Dave MJ, I went caseless with my 6P and my iPhone 5 before that, and I can tell you that the backs of both phones looked perfect, while the edges were scratched and nicked all over. Many people never drop their phones (on rocks or otherwise), I never have, but almost everyone I know gets little scratches around the edges for various reasons. So it's not unreasonable to only want a bumper case, and Deathalo is partly right that a bumper would still protect the back from minor falls. Different strokes for different folks. No need to pick fights with people expressing a simple opinion. MJ I don't understand the point of your comment? I didn't say phones don't get nicked up and scratched on the edges or dented at the corners. You have no scratches on the back? Lucky you... I see phones with scratched up and/or cracked backs all the time. Are you making an argument I should remove my case on my phone? You did a really poor job and no thanks. San Diego Dave @oldtimefighter:disqus Nope, that wasn't my point at all. I literally summed up everything for you in one sentence: "So it's not unreasonable to only want a bumper case, and Deathalo is partly right that a bumper would still protect the back from minor falls." How did you get "you shouldn't use a case" out of that? Had I used bumper cases on my iPhone 5 and 6P, they'd be flawless today. So obk88's original post was not unreasonable, and your response - "Not if you care about your phone at all!" - isn't necessarily true. Also obk88's comment could've just been a simple statement of preference, no need to pick fights. A simple - "I prefer a case that covers the back of the phone as well, because I'm always scratching/dropping it, so a bumper won't do the job" - would've sufficed. ;) Nathan Smith The bumper goes completely around the sides of the phone, so it would be completely fine hitting the edge of a stair, the edge of a curb, etc. The edge would make contact with the case at two points, and absolutely no part of the device would be directly hit. You'd have to be pretty damn unlucky to break the phone, and most people would take that tradeoff for the ergonomics. MJ What? Do you not understand that we live in a 3D world? Phones have a back side dude! Metal dents and scratches fairly easy. Bumpers offer minimal protection and if that is good enough for you fine but NOT for me. They make full cases that are pretty slim and offer better protection which is a better value for my money. Period. End of story. David Ruddock And a big welcome to Jon, who has committed his extensive experience evaluating phone cases to this article! Peter Silie And I already thought hey, this name doesn't sound familiar! :D Artem Russakovskii It should if you read comments and G+. He's a frequent commenter. Đức Thành I didn't notice the new name before I read on for a bit and wondered, "wait, has AP ever a phone case enthusiast?" Then I scrolled up and went "ooh." Artem Russakovskii Welcome, Jon! Jon Fridman Thank you Artem! Omari Gordon What screen protector are you using? Jon Fridman I have some cheap Supershieldz one on still. My Pixel will be transitioning over to the Intelliarmor version once it ships out. JTC Did you install the intelliarmor? Does it show a halo? Jon Fridman I installed their 'pro' model, no halo or issues so far. Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ But does this Jon know anything or he too knows nothing? Artem Russakovskii Looks like he knows a few things. Sumeet Deshmukh We know that he knows a lot about cases Đức Thành Do you know that thanks to this comment now I know that we know that he knows a lot about cases. Sumeet Deshmukh That's what I do! I drink and I know things Đức Thành I bet you didn't know at the time that 7 months after this comment I came back just to tell you about what you didn't know. (I'm like a time traveler, except I can only travel in one direction: from the past to the future.) mustbepbs Woo! Welcome Jon! Martim Welcome to the team, Jon! wickets im using a pleson.....small profile and fits nicely. kept my 6p out of harms way for 12 months......thats a huge feat right there...anyway, surprised it isnt on your 'near future' list David Ruddock I'm sure Jon would be happy to hear some recommendations. After all, there are roughly eleventy billion case manufacturers out there. Jon Fridman I owned a clear Pleson case for my Nexus 6P. In my experience the case had buttons that were overly stiff therefore rendering it virtually useless to me. I'm always open to trying new cases, but generally I won't buy the same case if I had an issue with it earlier unless the manufacturer addressed the issue(s). Lucas Laws Any chance of adding the Incipio Carnaby to your list? JSo I always end up taking my case off my phones because I like how they feels better without one. Screen Protectors are a must have though. Jeff Beck I feel the same way about pants. Zack How are screen protectors a must? I've never scratched the front of a phone in years. JSo Anything that protects the screen should be a must in my opinion. That's the one thing on a phone that you need. The casing around everything is not as important and, in some cases, easily replaceable. If you drop your phone face down, the screen protector can take most of the hit. And if that gets messed up, that's easier and cheaper to replace than a full screen. ClearlyYoureWrong Hooray, you! SlenderSniper Is Seidio not doing a case for the Pixel or XL? rcllcr Great article. Would appreciate if you could add the official google silicone case to this review: https://store.google.com/product/pixel_case_silicone Jon Fridman I've thought about buying one seeing how only the bottom is exposed. I can deal with one open note, not two like on their clear case. If I do get one, you will see it on my upcoming reviews list. Felix I would appreciate that too! And the Google Live Cases too! :) Brett I've been surprised that neither Spigen nor Ringke are making slim fit, semi-rubberized (Nexus 5-like) cases this time around. And supposedly Spigen isn't planning to: https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/5akq79/spigen_has_no_plans_on_releasing_a_thin_fit_case/. The alternatives I've found are compromised in one way or another. The Bear Motion sand case doesn't provide sufficient coverage (particularly at the top and bottom), and the material doesn't seem to fit the bill--it's sandy but not rubberized: https://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Slim-Case-Google-Pixel/dp/B01M0NBJ79/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1478033658&sr=8-1&keywords=Bear+Motion+Pixel The Maxboost mSnap is close but doesn't seem to be the right material (smooth and matte, so not much to grip), and the button cutouts don't look great: https://www.amazon.com/Maxboost-Perfect-Anti-Slip-Excellent-Protective/dp/B01M3MQCG0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1477942297&sr=8-1&keywords=Google+Pixel+Case+-TPU+-iPhone Any alternatives in this class I haven't considered? Any insight into whether Spigen or Ringke will eventually make one? Cory Wilson Yeah I don't get that either. I actually am rocking one on my Nexus 6p now and love it Gytole I can't get off of the official 6P case, it just feels so nice IUse2Phones I have the Maxboost mSnap and like it. For TPU cases, I've always gone Diztronic. For slim cases, I like Ringke Slim. Hope they decide to make one. Suicide_Note I've had the Spigen Rugged Armor on my XL from day one. Looks good, but most importantly keeps the phone well protected. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I still prefer my phone bare, but that Spigen is fantastic. It arrived a day before my phone and I use it whenever I'm in a situation where I expect to need the coverage, and other than making the phone bigger overall (which just makes it feels so much smaller when I take the case off), it's incredibly easy to get used to. ONLY complaint I have is my pinkie fits into, and rubs against, the cut-out groove for charging, which is uncomfortable. Otherwise it's a great case. Kurt John may want to ease up on the Otter hate. His commentary (including a personal note) about not liking Otter undermines the credibility of the review. David Ruddock I agree with Jon that Otterbox is substantially overhyped and overpriced largely because of brand recognition. They're "the" rugged case OEM, sort of the Under Armour of cases. As he points out, there's basically the same protection to be had at a substantially lower price - with a lot less bulk - unless you absolutely must have port covers. I'm not saying Otterbox is all hype, and I don't think Jon did, either. He gave the case a fair shake. Kurt I would say the article was unbiased if his claims that the other cases offer the same protection was backed up with some tests performed to validate the statement. Show me a test where they both fail at the same point of impact. The only example provided was a sample N of 1 saying "the Speck never broke for me". Word choice like "trivial" and "comical" give him away. Jon Fridman I would absolutely love to do a drop test, unfortunately I also can't sacrifice my phone if the tests got the best out of my Pixel XL. I can ask each company for procedures used when establishing their claim and see where that gets us. Jon Fridman I understand where you're coming from, but I did purchase the case to use not for a review earlier in October. I shared my personal view, and other information in the review to give people a better overall understanding. I want to make if clear that no special treatment was given to any case, nor was I asked to say/not say anything. I'm always open to trying different cases regardless of my initial feelings toward the oem, design etc. The Spigen Rugged Armor and Speck Presidio Grip both offer 'militaty grade'drop protection in s amich smaller package. Otterbox is the only only with a holster and true front protection as I noted in my review giving them a slight advantage at the price of added bulk. You're certainly welcome to disagree with me, I'm by no means the final say on any product, case or other accessory. I ordered a view stemming from my experiences, opinion and factual information the best I could. I will keep your comment in mind for when I add future reviews. Lando I'm curious about why you wouldn't compare the cases above to the otterbox commuter. I've had them for 3 phones, and they don't seem to have much more bulk than the spiegen case I looked at, and the port covers are definitely handy. And at about $40, it's not like they're crazy overpriced Jon Fridman I don't have the commuter, although generally I would agree depending on what Spigen case. Personally I'm waiting on LifeProof (OtterBox) to release their case hopefully before the new year. blindexecutioner The google clear case would have been so much better if the entire thing was matte. I bought one and promptly returned it due to the rainbowing effect. I can confirm it does scratch really easily too. Just wiping it off created all sorts of very faint scratches/swirl marks. San Diego Dave I also returned it. It was a flimsy piece of plastic. I expect that from a $7 case on Amazon, not a $30 case from Google. ClearlyYoureWrong You should expect it from any glossy, clear, plastic case, period. San Diego Dave Nice name, haha. I've had hard plastic cases that were nicer in the past, but they were kind of thick. This Google one is way too thin, which is why it feels extra flimsy and cheap. Anyway I got the Spigen Liquid Crystal case and it's perfect (and only $14). Nick Gangemi I have the Spiegen clear case, and it is much better. Doesn't scratch easily at all and doesn't show mark very easily either. person I'm a fan of the silicone case. Crazy soft, reasonably grippy, sturdy and minimalist. Paired a white XL with a grey case for a panda look. Đức Thành A phone case enthusiast. Wow. Does AP aim to have it all? Just like Google? Ahem, back on topic. That Spigen case looks really sweet. And if I'm correct, they made some nice Nexus 5 case as well. Maybe I'll just buy that one for my N5 and pretend that it's a new phone case for the new Pixel I own (I actually don't). Sob. EnerJi How important are screen protectors these days? I've run case-less for a couple of years and suffered for it with a couple of cracked screens. With my next phone (likely a Pixel XL, if it gets a decent sale) I'm planning to put it in a case. I'm willing to consider a screen protector as well, but is Gorilla Glass so scratch resistant that it's unnecessary? (I would never intentionally put my phone in a pocket with keys or coins, but of course, mistakes and accidents happen.) Perhaps most importantly to me, would they negatively impact the touch latency of the Pixel? JSo I've been using Tempered Glass screen protectors for a little while now. Before, I just used generic ones. But the glass ones are really nice. In my experience, they don't take anything away from the use or look of the screen. Protection-wise, I'd rather have it than not. If something cracks or scratches, I'd rather it be the protector than the actual screen. Jon Fridman I would say they're very important, especially in my line of work. I've already noticed micro scratches on my fingerprint scanner, so I couldn't imagine what my screen would look like after 2 weeks. blakeleeper @jonfridman:disqus Nice Article. I currently use the Spigen Neo Hybrid on my XL. BTW Which TGSP do you use? Jon Fridman Thank you! I currently have a cheap one off Amazon made by SuperShieldz until I can find something a little better. jonathan3579 Do you have the link to it? Jon Fridman I'm currently using an cheap SuperShieldz one from Amazon. The TGSP isn't what I would call great fyi. It covers the screen with no halo that's all that matters. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01LZT3PGR/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1 mustbepbs Excellent article. I love posts that review cases for phones that just came out. It's hard to wade through YT videos to find good case reviews. Abhishek Saral Rhinoshield Crashguard Bumper all the way!🙌 Michael Sullivan Ditto, really liking it. Only wish the buttons were not so hard to push but not a big enough of an issue to not use this Bumper. Robert Butler I can't stand mine. Ports are too small, buttons are bad, and my phone doesn't sit level on my desk anymore. Jon Fridman I see the button issues from the Nexus 6P version hasn't been addressed then. Robert Butler I think they are worse! Thomas Jensen The buttons can be fixed nicely if you use the small blunt end of something like a chopstick. You push and stretch the power and volume buttons out then in stretching them several times with medium pressure. Do it on both ends and both sides. It will loosen them up and will work great. (just don't push too hard w the stick and break it). Try it. You will be happy! Good_Ole_Pinocchio This is why I love this site. Always going to extra mile. A lot of other blogs would just give you their "Here's a list of the best cases we never reviewed with referral links" BevansDesign A lot of other blogs HAVE done that. Jeez there are a lot of garbage sites to wade through. This article is like a sharp, shiny needle in a monetization haystack. Tomfoolery Seriously. AP has shown themselves to be the only Android news blog that takes itself seriously. They consistently produce new, useful, substantiated content. I don't see many other android journalists (or even other journalists in other fields) do as fantastic of a job as you guys do. The APK teardowns, fantastic sources of information. Don't see others doing this. You don't just post "Oh boy i think this is happening rumor rumor rumor." You go through the code line by line to see what it could mean. That's dedication. Every week, the "x apps of the week." Awesome! What a great way to find apps. Original reviews, insightful and honest opinions, I love it! All other general news. Always original content. Rarely do I see recycled "this rumor happened" and "this is coming out" like I do from literally every other blog. Getting to know Android x.x.x. Perfect. Probably my favorite recurring thing on any blog ever. Basically, what I'm trying to say, is thank you so much for putting out actual content. Thank you for not trying to get pageviews from "hot" titles and "latest rumors!" Thank you for trying to get pageviews from writing solid articles and putting thought into almost every post. Seriously, I love you guys. I hope you can tell from all the upvotes and how many of your stories hit the front page! But even still, I wanted to let you know how absolutely grateful I am (and we all are)! Stick around, and keep up the fantastic work! We don't take it for granted, even if it might seem like it sometimes! tl,dr; I LOVE YOU ANDROID POLICE! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING! <3 Derek R Thanks Jon! I've had the Presidio sitting in my VZW cart for a while now. Read this article and pulled the trigger. Currently alternating between the Spigen Rugged Armor and Maxboost Liquid Skin. Both are decent. I was really excited about the Rhinoshield Crashguard Bumper. Got it in yesterday and was less than impressed. It doesn't flow with the phone at all. Tapered edges make the bottom of the phone look like its going to pop right out. Looks awkward and feels odd in my hand. wire141 Presidio isn't as grippy as the candy shell but it's close. Love mine! Ordered silicone grey from Google to check it out. I find it to slippery for me. Received today, waiting for email to return. Thanks for the article Jon! Jon Fridman I wasn't thrilled with my RhinoShield either when I had my Nexus 6P. The buttons on it were awful in addition to the bumper being larger than comparable cases like the Rugged Armor. Speck did an excellent job with their Presidio which isn't something I say lightly about cases. I can be very picky when it comes to what cases I will actually use not just buy. Right now I alternate between the Rugged Armor and Presidio depending on what I feel like using. Nexus Ordered the rugged armor one from Spigen. Love it! _jsw_ Excellent article, and welcome, Jon! Spigen case: ordered. I'm curious: have you found or heard rumor of any decent wallet cases or at least flip cases like the Nexus 6P Folio? I had one of those (the official Folio) on my 6P (since given to my brother, post-Pixel XL purchase), and I miss it. Well made, classy look, excellent screen protection. I've yet to find something similar for the XL. Jeff Badger Case-Mate has one; though, it is $60. http://www.case-mate.com/collections/google-cases-and-covers/products/wallet-folio-black-leather _jsw_ Excellent - thanks. A bit pricey for me, but I'll keep it in mind! Evan When I purchased my Pixel at the Verizon Store the salesman gave me large selection of cases to look through, one being a wallet case... I couldn't tell you the brand or anything else but they are out there. It should be noted though that I have a standard pixel so the case may not be made for the XL asian_slaw What screen protector do you have on your Pixel? Shane Curious about this as well. Still trying to find a good one. _jsw_ Thirded. Krups My Yootech screen protector (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LY8LVSB) looks similar to this one. This might be the same one. Edit: Pictures - https://goo.gl/photos/FF7F1vYegbWd8qRB9 Jon Fridman Please see the comment above Bob Does no one miss the rubberized Adopted case for the Nexus 6P??? It was slim yet very durable and protective. jawsnnn Question... Isn't the glass window supposed to be there because of all the sensors etc... If so, will the phones with cases covering that area function as well as a naked phone? BTW, excellent review! _jsw_ As long as the case is transparent to electromagnetic waves (as all of these are), there won't be issues. Metal cases would cause problems if they covered the necessary areas of the back/sides. ×XWreckTeamX× Love the software of the pixel I hate the way that phone looks though its so ugly!!! sgtguthrie I won't buy a case without a kickstand anymore. I used to always buy Seidio, but they're taking too long to release cases. I think it'll be Spigen Slim Armor for my XL. Denis Wagner You typed something twice on the spigen case part: "but it can also be found for $13.99 (as I'm writing this) on but it can also be found for $13.99 (as I'm writing this) on Amazon." Jon Fridman Thank you, it should be fixed now. Thankfully Rita didn't see it first ;) jonathan3579 Who made that TGSP? The fitment looks about perfect! Tom Luley Would love to know as well. Jon Fridman I'm currently using an cheap SuperShieldz one from Amazon. The TGSP isn't what I would call great fyi. It covers the screen with no halo that's all that matters. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01LZT3PGR/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1 tom_roars Rocking the Spigen Slim Armor on the Pixel XL.Love it Cory S I'd like to see a test on the effects of thermal throttling with, and without a case. Especially with some of these really thick rubbery cases. Give it a shot on a 810 device to really see if it has any major difference. T4rd I've been a big fan of Supcase Beetle on my past few phones. My M8 and 6P took some insane falls with it, 2 from a roller coaster and carnival ride, and weren't damaged at all. For the minimal bulk they add, their protection is stellar. https://www.amazon.com/SUPCASE-Unicorn-Premium-Protective-Release/dp/B01M8KBFFP/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1478195296&sr=8-2&keywords=supcase+pixel slurivariv The Spigen Case with the Kickstand is my case of choice. Sooo good. Preben Nielsen We need more cases that can hide that ugly back with the glass.... MrCalifornia I just got my diztronic. It's exactly like the one I had on my 6P and it's perfect. Simple and smallish. Martin B. I just love, that Ringke is still adding opening for small strap for their Fusion cases. I found it accidentally, when I bought mine for Nexus 5, and with it on hand, its impossible to drop phone during taking photos or other activities. Are there any other case, which have this feature? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ced021331f97beeb38f90ce5ca9f9201386118ddcaf29bae0cd6e16547f3cf96.jpg Abhi I like Spigen, they have a lot of simple but elegant looking cases without too much going on. SHunter You can get it in any color, so long as its black. Henry Pham Part of the attraction, for me, to buying a Pixel is I'd be able to buy the $99 2 year drop insurance from Google so that I'd be able to go case free with less worry. And then there's the $150 screen replacement at a repair chain. Like the article says, buying from Google should hopefully provide better customer support later. Tired_Guy Anyone else using the headphones made for Project Fi and the Nexus 6? White, have a plug in for a 2nd person? Big round base that no case will allow to work. Had similar issues with cases that won't handle well a 90 degree plus or where teh hole is simply too small to allow full connection. The Spigen I got for my Pixel XL lets the Project Fi headphones work but it's on the edge of popping out. (The fact that headphone inline volume up triggers the assistant is an irritation for another time.) BetterWithRoot I am currently using the Rhinoshield (https://rhinoshield.io/collections/google-pixel-google-pixel-xl). The texture is decent, the buttons are a bit harder to press, but if you 'stretch' the buttons out it makes it a lot better to use. I like being able to feel the open back and glass of the phone. I had a bumper case on my Moto-X that I loved, so this case is just what i wanted. I am a bit worried about the open back, as the moto-X had the leather which looked better as it weathered. One issue i found with the Rhinoshield is the supplied USB-B to USB-C is a bit thicker and have to give it a slight push, the USB-C to USB-C fits like a glove, no additional pushing. Both mine and my lady's pixel exhibit this issue. I wonder if the size of the cable is slightly smaller for the Type C to Type C. AOSPrevails I love Spigen Touch Armor, $5 more than the Rugged armor case with a hard back & a kickstand. John Misoulis @jonfridman:disqus, you should try the Spigen Ultra Hybrid Google Pixel Case. i got it from Amazon for $20 for my Pixel XL and love it. It looks and feels like a cross between a hard case and a rubber case. the only thing i wish i could find is a plug for the USB-C port. Jon Fridman I should be reviewing quite a few Spigen cases shortly. I'll add them to the upcoming list once I know which ones. climbhigher I have the "made by Google - clear" case on my pixel right now as I type on it. I sent a message to support on the Google store earlier this afternoon about how incredibly poor quality this case actually is. I agree with the entire review and would like to add that the clear top part attracts scratches unlike any phone case I have ever used. Could have bought 3 better quality cases on Amazon for $30... Matthew Benyamin I originally got the clear case by Google, but I hated it. It got scratched as soon as I set it down. I ended up replacing it with the Spigen rugged armor and have no regrets. I like that it keeps the look on the back and the body lines of the phone. I am also a huge fan of the power button texture. Can you guys add one of those rhino bumper cases to your review line up too? Fatty Bunter Guh...all those cases except the clear google one just look offensive to my eyes. Those poor beautiful pixels may as well be HTC Thunderbolts under there. Michael Sørensen Con for all: ugly as sin Nicholas Matranga Nice to see a grat selction Danny Alvarez You should add the Neo Hybrid from Spigen in here. I bought it and it's very good, good protection and best of all, they have a blue version that matches the Really Blue from the Pixels and looks really nice. http://www.spigen.com/products/neo-hybrid-google-pixel-xl-case?variant=27822451009 leganzish "This marks the first time that Otterbox (the company that also owns Lifeproof) has made a case for a Google device." Maybe you're not considering Nexus phones to be Google devices here. Otterbox definitely has made Nexus cases in the past. Don't think they've done so recently, but I had an Otterbox on my Galaxy Nexus. https://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-Defender-Series-Samsung-Galaxy/dp/B006JO232E Lawrence Pixel phone is so uninspiring. The glass on the back is awful, the finger print sensor should be on front. Huge bezels. Come on. Adam Margeson The iP7 phone is so uninspiring. Same bland boring look it's had for years, just with a second camera and missing home button. And some people like the fingerprint sensor being on the back, thank you. Lawrence I got the 5X for a two weeks and unlocking it while at my desk was painful. I gave the phone away and got my Note 3 back with front home button and delayed lock. Adam Margeson So, then the 5X and Pixel aren't for you. We get that. You've posted your thoughts on them in nearly every article for the last several months, and I can't quite figure out if you're an Apple fanboi [sic] or just a run-of-the-mill troll. Most of the rest of us are reasonably impressed with Google's latest offering. Sure, it could still use some refinement, but for a first-run "Google" phone, it's definitely headed in the right direction. Hopefully next year's device will shut you up. Lawrence No I'm not an Apple fan. I have a note 3and owned at least 4 nexus. I'm just trying to bring the Pixel down to its value which is around 375 for thr xl version, then I'll buy it and deal with the bad placed fingerprint reader and rest my Starbucks coffee on its bezel. Adam Margeson Add wireless charging back in and this thing easily is worth more than my N5 when I first bought it for $400 (32GB). Better build, way better camera, etc... The N5 was initially called a boring look, yet it's still being used as the device silhouette for most screenshots, even outside of Google. I'd start it closer to $500 (for the base storage) as a reasonable compromise. I can see this phone lasting 3 or 4 years if treated nicely. Saying that you want this quality of a phone for $375 over-values the budget "flagship killers" who do cut important corners, including software updates, crappy user experience, non-optimized camera (taking a great sensor and putting it in without setting it up, ala OP3 and others), etc. Have you taken your high-school economics course yet, or did you already fail it? JohnyNoLegs I keep double tapping the screen on my wifes Note4 and it doesn't wake up, then go to unlock it and it takes what feels like 10 years. Nexus 5X unlocks far quicker, and it now has double tap to wake. So it trumps the note 3. Zack Or just buy insurance and don't drop your phone :D Naked baby. ClearlyYoureWrong If you don't drop your phone and you've never cracked a screen why should you, Zack, purchase insurance? icethegreat Ish happens Nizar Noor Hi guys. If you tweet @Caudabe https://twitter.com/Caudabe they might want to consider making a case for Pixel. They're iPhone cases are great - very slim and durable. San Diego Dave I purchased the clear case from Google and returned it for a refund immediately. It's flimsy plastic with no grip. Definitely not worth $30. I just got the Spigen Liquid Crystal case (clear), and it's perfect. Very slim, very grippy, and only $14. thereasoner Went with the Spigen myself. It was one of the first ones available and because I pre-ordered on day one and got my Pixel 2 days early, I needed a case right away. It's a quality soft case but I like the slim hard shell Spigen usually. Chris Vander Maas I'd like to know what he does for his full time job to necessitate needing a case, tbh reading case reviews from someone that gives the impression of not properly taking care of a device, seems a bit off to me. Is this for the people who insist on walking over concrete staring down at the phone and not paying attention to the world around? I've never broken a phone and I've been using smartphones since before iOS and Android Not for you A few more slim/thin cases would be nice. Any chance you can mention how much bulk the cases add? i.e. how wide & tall are they? Felix Yeah,I would appreciate that too! For me a case must be as thin as possible. Brandon What is the glass screen protector you're using? I can't find one that actually covers the entire screen. The one at this IMG specifically looks like it actually covers the screen properly. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nexus2cee_IMG_0590-2.jpg JohnyNoLegs Its not a glass one I bet. Can't get that coverage with a glass one. Volodesi Spigen always makes good cases. It's all I've used for my past three phones. thomas sim Waiting for Slim Armor, had one on my N5 and love it. Tronsmart Welcome Jon! mjl99 not a fan of cases but i liked this article. Thanks for serving too. Merkin McGee https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWWLAYY/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Got one of those. I have had a variation of the same case on every phone I have had since the Galaxy Nexus. Just a simple TPU case. has a nice grip due to the texture on the sides. Doesn't slip out of the hand so it doesn't really fall. bravo2wo Have you evaluated the cases available from Ringke?? I use their Fusion model on my Samsung S7E and am very happy; especially given the low price. bravo2wo Duh, just saw it on your list of "to be evaluated", sorry! I did just just order an Onyx model and am anxiously awaiting its arrival. Frank Duque As a long RhinoShield supporter, I say they should be added to your list of reviews. Thank you for your time Evan Great article! Originally I wanted to get a blue pixel but they were sold out at the Verizon store I went to. Ended up getting the silver instead and in the long run I definitely think that will help me out with getting cases. With a blue one I would have all but had to get a clear case to showcase the color! With the silver I'm a little less concerned with that so I've got a nice looking case on here. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c8d81971259efbcd3b582e944707b74f9a5cb1cc07253c559638d0653ec348a.jpg RuR Can you add Spigem Though Armor? cbryancan I started with the Google branded hard clear plastic and was disappointed by the way it looks like it "sticks" to the glass on the upper back. Just got the Spigen Liquid Crystal and I am very happy with it so far. Usually I don't like soft materials, but it fits well and gives the phone it a nice tacky surface to hold onto without being obtrusive or bulky. Enrique Can you also review some tempered glass screen protectors? There are a lot of bad reviews on Amazon because most of them don't cover the entire screen Jon Fridman Reviewing TGSP's would be fun, but at the same time it can be difficult. I'm not sure what I'll be reviewing, or writing next, so I'll keep your request in mind. abc The first two cases are ugly af. ryraansh Can you do the Incipio Carnaby? It looks pretty nice: https://www.incipio.com/cases/smartphone-cases/google-smartphone-cases-accessories/google-pixel-cases/carnaby-google-pixel-case.html Nathaniel Carter I already ordered but maybe add this caseology case to the mix? http://amzn.to/2fsi4z8 DKS The phone is big enough as-is. I tried an Obliq TPU case but it just made the phone feel too bulky. The best for me so far has been the BearMotion case with a Sandstone texture like on the OnePlus phones. It's thin so it doesn't offer much in the way of drop protection but it provides a good grip and scratch protection. I'd like to see some 'skins' reviewed with those same qualities in mind. Jon Fridman Are you asking whether or not I'll review thin 'barely there' cases like Spigen's Thin Fit (if they made one for the Pixel/Pixel XL)? I'm open to adding some thinner ones in the future. Personally I find the phone too small given how I also use a V20 for work daily. On that note I understand where you're coming from because not everyone enjoys larger phones. Try Thinking I disagree with your take on the tech21 case's cutouts. It's actually a good thing that they have a less precise camera cutout. If those cutouts are too tight you get does screwing with the laser autofocus. This seems to be a growing problem with the Spiegen case. Thanks for the reviews! Jon Fridman I've used the camera often enough with both cases, and had no issues myself. The laser is not blocked by the case, nor does it come close to covering the return port. If you're experiencing an issue, or if it's more widespread (I'm not saying it is), then I will consider making a note in the review. I'm glad you enjoyed the reviews thus far, more will be coming shortly. Try Thinking Hey Jon, The problem isn't so much that the case itself is blocking the laser, but that the cutout is so small that dust quickly accumulates in the cutout and blocks the laser, and you have to remove the case to clean it. Here's a link to people describing the issue on Reddit: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/5ctfvs/your_case_is_likely_causing_your_auto_focusing/ Looking forward to more of your reviews and thanks for the response! Jon Fridman Thank you for the link. I'm overly OCD about dust on my phone which is why I always carry a microfiber cloth no matter where I go. I can see dust being an issue only if your phone is constantly dirty. I live in West Texas where you can wash your car and have it look horrible in 5 minutes or less. I haven't experienced the issue myself, but I can a statement addressing that. Another way to remove the dust without taking your phone out of the case is to use canned air, or blow on it? I have an issue with dust getting into the top speaker grill more than I do on the laser (similar issue). Orlando aka Pixel XL i just like to go raw dog, i just dont feel safe that way, ZING! kennethreynolds8 Thanks Jon for doing the leg work for us, greatly appreciated dude. Jon Fridman You're welcome, I hope you enjoy the reviews. I will post more early next week assuming the cases arrive. Sachin Bahal What material is the Pixel XL Case by Google - Clear made from? Is it TPU, silicone or is it a hard plastic? Jon Fridman I believe it's some sort of polycarbonate judging by the thickness, rigidity and how the material feels. op12 Yep, that's also what Google lists on the product detail page. https://store.google.com/product/pixel_xl_case_clear b00sted I have the Spigen Clear TPU. Had The Damn Rainbow effect but i like clear so can see the dbrand and I tossed a club sticker behind the case. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6aceda2332b5ac48a3d2224f1825b6039a6e5f8524cf24d87270175e3a72f9e8.jpg Not for you PSA - someone on xda-dev has noted focusing issues with the Spigen Rugged Armor: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=69637754&postcount=21 It sounds like Spigen will be revising the cutouts. Kyle Brabender I had the tech21 case. i laughed when i read your comment about the power button. It's so true. I moved to the spiegen crystal case. so much better. Jon Fridman The more I use Tech 21's case the more I notice these issues. I picked my phone up as my alarm went off and couldn't hit the buttons to shut it off, yes it's that bad. Impulse_Vigil Loving these reviews, there's a couple in here I had looked at with trepidation and the reviews give me good cause to steer clear. Looking forward to that Diztronic Pixlee review as it's caught my eye, I'm happy with everything about the Spigen Rugged Armor but want something more colorful for day to day use. I had several solid cases from them in the past too. Any chance you'll review some of these new fangled (to me) 2-piece cases? I'm not sure if having a plastic bumper around TPU case really adds any protection but they certainly make for an interesting look. I'm alluding to the likes of the Spigen Neo Hybrid (only for the XL thus far), Caseology Parallax series, and Orzly AirFrame. Cruzerlite's TPU cases might be worth a look too (there's two back designs, one with covered buttons and one without), tho for me they're a known quantity; about as solid as Diztronic's IMO. Jon Fridman I should have a number of Spigen cases on the way including the NeoHybrid. Once whose arrive I'll voice my opinions on each one. Concerning the Caseology and Orzly cases I won't be getting those unless something changes. Impulse_Vigil Looking forward to it! I actually emailed Spigen a few weeks ago asking about the Neo Hybrid for the smaller Pixel and they replied (really quickly) that it was coming but they didn't have an ETA... I've been meaning to email them again, because the Neo Crystal came out since then, and I'm not quite sure if that's what they meant... Without having seen them in person, I much prefer the look of the regular Neo. Not crazy about clear TPU myself (reminds me of couches with vinyl wraps), it tends to yellow more noticeably, and the plastic back on the Crystal Neo seems like it'd make it bulkier. Anyway, carry on with the great work! Few case reviews are as incisive but to the point as these, they usually read like adverts and have little basis for comparison. Having one writer review several is great IMO. Ryan I bought the Incipio Octane for my 5". It's awesome. Jon Fridman I'm considering the Octane case. Back when I had a S7 Edge and HTC 10, the Octane was great. I expect Incipio to maintain their good reputation for that case unless some changes were made. T4rd Shame about the new Supcase design. They've been my fav cases on my previous two phones (One M8 and 6P). They are pretty much perfect on those phones. I had my M8 fall from a roller coaster mid-loop with the UB and it was still perfect somehow after landing on some loose concrete. So I've been a big fan of them since then. Jon Fridman SupCase had a very unique design before this generation. Now we are left with a boring, mediocre looking brick that doesn't stand our anymore. I would like to see them revert back to the N6/6P styles personally. ericlee Good review thank youuuu! :D Jon Fridman Thank you, more cases will be added in the coming week. NinoBr0wn Was it mentioned anywhere in the article what screen protector that is? Jon Fridman I didn't mention the one in using in the write up, but I did a few times in the comments. I wouldn't recommend it unless you really need one and don't mind not having your whole screen covered (the actual display not the front). It's a Super Shieldz one from Amazon that I've been too lazy to replace lately. NinoBr0wn Oh ok then. I haven't been able to find one that covers the entire screen, and I'm guessing that because of the 2.5D glass. I could use my Liquid Armor for scratches, but I wanted one with drop protection. Erik O Any chance you can take a look at Obliq cases? Neat looking designs https://obliqproduct.com/products/google-pixel-case-flex-pro or https://obliqproduct.com/products/google-pixel-case-slim-meta?variant=28018622529 Robert Butler Is it too much to ask for a backless bumper with the textured power button? Come on google, lets get the accessory game on point. SAM Bump up the brightness in pics. Cases are not easily visible. broken42 I'd suggest the Caseology Parallax for the list, I have it and it's great. Anfronie Good lord those all suck. JPJ Thanks for the thorough look. I went with the Spigen case. It was readily available and fairly cheap. I like it. Adam Margeson I hate using cases on phones because they've already gotten to be too large for proper one-handed use, but the Spigen case is a comforting experience. It doesn't add much in the way of bulk, but it really keeps my mind at ease that I'm not going to shatter something the first time I drop it. Watcharapong Dokmai try rhinoshield you will love it :) get it here >>> http://www.ebay.com/itm/201722023016 Jon Fridman Thank you for the recommendation, but I will not be reviewing the Evolutive Rhino Shield bumper. My experience with their bumper was extremely poor with my Nexus 6, and I would prefer not to have a repeat of that. Orlando aka Pixel XL Dont review it, I used the case and it doesn't fit the factory charger plug. Lunkman The one I received fits just fine- I think it's great- and I typically keep my phones naked. Perhaps the one you received simply had a manufacturing defect? ALEX P. Thanks for the reviews. Does anyone know when the LifeProof cases will be available? Jon Fridman I have no idea when it's due to be released. I'm going to order one whenever they become available given the industry I work in. The one downside I can see from the start is how no TGSP will fit under the built in screen protector. When the case goes up for preorder I'll add it to my upcoming list. PiGSeL I just received the Speck Presidio Grip for my Pixel XL and I'm pretty unhappy with it. The polycarbonate side grips are very hard - I find them uncomfortable. The USB cutout is also sharp, which is a big problem for pinky resting. I will probably send it back in favor of the Diztronic TPU. Mike Dillinger i'm new to your site. I have a very blue pixel and am looking for a glass screen protector for it. I got one from the verizon store where I got my phone, but its starting to slowly come off at the edges. BTW I have the Speidio clear case and love it. Eric Horchuck Great review, thanks! FYI... I'm pretty sure that Google started selling cases for the Nexus 4. I remember that I wanted their "bumper case" but it was out of stock. Ben Rees I'm using the Cruzerlite Androidified case. Love it. Great protection and the look and feel is great. Amir I got Maxboost mSnap and Caseology Parallax for my XL, and I think both deserve to hold top spot on this article. lara141 Here’s the tutorial to solve the problems of your google pixele & To unlock the device when you forgot Pattern,Pin,Password.. http://www.mobiles6.com/how-to-reset-google-pixel-xl.html Gerald Mark Is this list sort of in order by best to worst? There's no way to be exact, and I also can get a really good idea of what case to try regardless, but I'm unsure between the first 3 or so. Thank goodness I didn't grab a case from Google. I knew they were overpriced but realizing they barely do their job too besides looking good is sad. I'm waiting till I finally get the XL I ordered for the fear of this easily scratched phone to really set in, then I'll choose a case. I know how to be SUPER careful in the meantime. Thanks for a super in depth review of cases for a phone, it was also a little entertaining. CC Any idea when this is getting updated next? I've been really looking forward to the Diztronic review! Jon Fridman Good news, I published the update. I've been a little busy at work due to some downsizing, departmental changes etc. supersanborn Ironic, I was just thinking that it felt like my Diztronic was not holding its shape super well despite looking great. Would be curious to know the top pics of all these cases at some point. Maybe like best of looks, best of protection, best of grip? Jon Fridman I can add my recommendations once it's all said and done. I'm waiting on Lifeproof to release their FRE case first. The Incipio Octane review should be added later this week too, although I prefer adding them in batches. supersanborn Thank you! Jon Fridman You're welcome Impulse_Vigil Really? Mine is like 5 months old now and I feel it's held its shape better than any other TPU case I've ever had... It's actually still really tight around the volume buttons, which is usually the first place they start to loosen up. Granted I tend not to swipe right against the edge out of habit (for years now)... The one place where I'm noticing some give on mine is at the top, and it's actually when I push in on it (or down if I'm holding the phone normally). My guess is the top has expanded a little due to the drag it's constantly experiencing from me pulling the phone out of my pocket (specially when seated), as I almost always always store my phone top-first in pocket (upside down). I've got a second one (bought teal first then orange once they came back in stock post Christmas), should try slap it on and see if it feels much snugger. Michael Carlyle "large camera cutout" - con I'd rather have that than the autofocus issues with all the Spigens... Jon Fridman I've noticed the issue with both large, and small camera cutouts. Because of this, I believe the issue is somewhat independent of the cutout size. It could be due to dirt, or other factors too. Edit: For the record, only two cases consistently have that issue: The Spigen Slim Armor, and Tech 21 EVO Check. Andrew Wilson I got the Caseology Parallax the other day and I am really liking it so far. The textured back has a really good grip to it but manages a more stylish look than a lot of the other options. In addition to adding a color accent, the ABS ring over the TPU gives a nice rigidity in the places your fingers naturally rest (something I didn't realized bothered me about my TPU only case until it was gone). The ports are plenty large and the ring around the fingerprint scanner has a nice slope to it, sort of funneling your finger to the right place. I don't know how it will hold up to drops, but it's so much easier to hold than the base phone I'm a lot less worried about it. Lastly, I paid $15 for it. My big gripes so far are that the volume buttons don't have any sort of texture to them (something I like very much about the base phone), and when I am pulling the phone out of my pocket my fingers seem to gravitate to the port around the camera. Thanks for the thorough coverage, if this case doesn't work out this gives me a good idea about where to look next. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e71a30a606c19cac33ee8e740ae84f0024709401783f473fcdd36b490e52033b.jpg dabug91 I second this option. We got the burgundy one for my mom's blue Pixel the other day and she loves it. The quality of this case is superb for its price and we will probably be getting her the blue one as well. The geometric pattern and texture on the back feels great in the hand and I would be buying myself the black version if I had a Pixel as my phone. Easily a 9/10 for this case. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ec568f9f8802b3f49ba18bd010db79bc7ecb253001672e7ba4392d7c7f3bc06.jpg Impulse_Vigil Burgundy on blue looks like an eyesore. I like either on their own, just not the combo... Personal preference tho. Dunno if it's the photo or what but the plastic trim looks almost pink there. I wish they hadn't recycled half the iPhone color palette. The black/grey is kinda boring and the other two have gold trims which don't match up super well with any of the Pixels, plus I'm just not a fan of gold. They had some with silver trim for Galaxy/iPhones but never made them for Pixels. Impulse_Vigil Does the phone lay flat with it or does that camera bump raise it up? I keep wondering that every time I see those Caseology cases, almost tried one but I've been so happy with the Diztronic Pixlee that I just bought a second one of those as backup. The negative comments about the similar Spigen Neo also kinda scared me away... I do still like that unique pattern on the Parallax tho. Andrew Wilson Looking at it from the side I guess it does stick out a tiny bit, but when I lay my phone on a table the way it sits is indistinguishable from perfectly flat. 4 months in, and I am still very happy with it. Impulse_Vigil Good to know, thx. Orlando aka Pixel XL I suggest the bumper case from rhinoshield. The port doesn't fit all of the type c cables but it does for most of mine. MJ I love my Spigen Rugged Armor case but black on my Really Black Pixel XL is a little boring. Thinking I am going to be picking up a couple of colorful Diztronic Pixlee cases. Impulse_Vigil They're nice, pretty unique look, and more understated than his photos portray... At least in teal, the orange is pretty loud but not as neon orange as the photos make it look, more like the inside of an actual orange. Mine has held up better than other TPU cases after 5+ months of use, real stiff around the volume buttons still with only a hint of stretching at the top where it's always dragging against my pocket as I pull the phone out. I only noticed when I randomly pushed down on it one day... If you put your phone right side up in your pocket the bottom might stretch sooner which would be more noticeable. I wrote a long Amazon review and I still stand by everything there... I should add some pics with the OJ and a video clip, the Pixlee shimmer effect is hard to describe. Demigod121 This is the case I have for my XL - http://www.i-blason.com/google-pixel-xl-armorbox-case.html?color=25 I'm a big fan of the clunky Otterbox cases, however I have to say I am really impressed with this case. Very sturdy and doesn't add the bulk that the Otterbox cases have. Rich Stone So clearly this article is about cases, but I'm curious as to what screen shield you have on in these photos? Brayden Reesor I'm one who prefers a case to be as thin and light as possible, mostly to provide scratch protection and grip. I've been using the Bear Motion "Sandy" case and it is really awesome. Very thin, and the texture is great! All the cutouts are perfect. And it was only $8. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MA16WSH/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Marcos on another site (or maybe on a previous post on this site), the slim tudia case was recommended. im awaiting mine for the Pixel (not XL). tyb82 Man those tempered glass screen covers are hideous. TimXer I bought a clear high grip case from LK on Amazon for $4 and it's awesome... perfect cutouts, non-slip grip Pedram Haghzaban How about Simply Carbon Fiber? digidude In my experience, an inexpensive TPU case with a screen guard is plenty to protect a phone in the most common accidents. compuguy1088 Will you be reviewing the seidio Surface ad DILEX cases by chance? dmo580 My Neo Hybrid is completely tight. I've seen where the frame is loose but I've owned one for my iPhone 5, 6, and Pixel and its very snug on the Pixel. I have seen loose Neo Hybrids before but this one is certainly not one. Perhaps there's lot to lot variation? If anything I'd be worried about the frame breaking. I had 2 break on my iPhone 6 and my iPhone 5 one broke at the bottom (USB port) Justin the neo hybrid on my phone doesnt suffer the flaws indicated, the only con from my month and a bit of use since it launched is that the back is really slippery Pedram Haghzaban Don't forget case from Simply Carbon Fiber Corey Miecielica Great article on pretty much all the popular cases out right now! I did notice that more cases as they come along will be added to this post. Looking forward to checking back time to time. Also would love to see some ultra thin case makers like Peel if they ever come along for Pixel phones! Kevin Davis The Speck presidio grip(also available in blue for the xl, through Verizon), and the Tech21 evocheck are my favorites. Also, you're correct about the Incipio octane, the border on the one for the S7edge I had was great, it's crap on the one for the Pixel, and the buttons are indeed terrible. chris Thanks for the article! I bought a spigen rugged armor on your suggestion and really like it! Question: which screen protector do you use? I've been having a hard time finding a decent one (tempered glass preferably) that doesnt have a ton of bubbles under the glass once installed. Thanks! Kole Hart I was a little disappointed to see the Spigen Tough Armor case to kinda get the crap rating. But I'm sure I haven't used as many cases as you have so I can appreciate the honesty. Overall I enjoyed the article and appreciate the extensive reviews of the many cases that are made for the Pixel. Jon Fridman Spigen has too many cases with so subtle differences to make me choose the Tough Armor. I would always take a Slim Armor over the Tough for reasons stated in my review. Kole Hart I just might check out the slim armor seeing as it was the other option I was going to go with. Any chance you could recommend a screen protector for the Pixel (Not the XL)? Jon Fridman I don't own a regular Pixel although they should be the same fit for both models. Obviously the XL has a bigger screen; cut should be identical across both models. Intelliarmor is usually my go to TGSP, even now it seems to be working fine. Carpentractor Love these reviews! One thing I would like to suggest is to put the new reviews at the top, instead of having to scroll to the bottom of the article to find the latest additions. Also, sorry to hear that your pixel has problems focusing, you should get that thing RMA'd, and see if if resolves anything! By the way, I have a relatively cheap Tudia Ultra slim matte case, and I'm super happy with it, especially the buttons, they are totally reasonable and the case looks great. The matte finish shows finger smudges and such easier than I expected, but overall I'm pretty happy with it. Jon Fridman There's a little menu at the top (red box) which takes you to any review if you click it. I though about doing an RMA for a while until I realized how dirt or dust is usually the issue. Tudia has made some good cases in the past. I normally get one if I can't find other decent TPU cases available. Michael Tran No love for the Spigen Neo hybrid crystal? I know it's another variation of the Spigen but it's very nice. Gives you the clear tpu shell so you can see your glass top but hard poly carbonate shell. Less bulky than the tough armor. The opening near the camera looks larger to so you get less flash reflection on photos. Jon Fridman Unfortunately I was only sent the regular Neo Hybrid. I can't imagine the case being any different than a simple clear version just like the rugged armor I reviewed. Michael Tran The camera cutout versus the other Spigen cases is a big difference. Avoids the dreaded flash issue plus the problem of dust collecting around the sensor. Also is just a hair bigger then the neo hybrid. Plus it comes in electric blue. 😀. Oh well I guess I just did a semi review haha Jon Fridman I have one in the electric blue (regular NeoHybrid) in the reviews. Camera cutouts aren't a huge deal on clear cases if the OEM paints the edge black to combat flaring. Personally I wouldn't buy the NeoHybrid based on my experiences with it. ApocalypsComet The one I'd like to see would be the UAG Plasma series. I have a Poetic Affinity for my Pixel and love it. Arguably one of the best cases I've had for any phone. Jon Fridman I've owned both of those cases for previous phones. Based on my experiences I will not be reviewing either one unless something changes. pascualine27 What's the best screen protector for the Google Pixel? I got the Benuo TGSP on Amazon and it's so bad. Doesn't cover the LCD fully and really bad halos on both sides! I'm getting a refund. I love my Spigen Rugged Armor case though. Jon Fridman I can't comment on the 'best' one since I've only tried a handful of them. Generally I stick with Intelliarmor depending on the phone I'm using. Jeff Rodrigues I ordered google pixel xl, but its backordered. So im waiting for it to ship out still. I bought this case: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/859ebc6977f0a4696107fd32c289dfb25bcec2700c091a7e1479b2eff23274f6.png Wasnt sure if you knew anything about it. And you have good reviews on those cases, it helps alot. If for some reason i need to change from the one i bought Frisi I have the Rhinoshield Bumper, I love it. Phone has fell twice with it and it has absorbed the impact quite well. My only gripe is that the USB cutout is not as big and some cables don't go in all the way, forcing me to remove the cable. Sarah Gray Bashford I use that tech21 smoke checkered case and the power button definitely gave me issues in the beginning. Have had it on for a month and a half now and it is WAY easier to press the button. I don't struggle at all now that it's broken in. Can't recall when I started noticing a difference though. mikeym0p Spigen Neo Crystal Hybrid? I have and love this case, it looks great and feels better than the regular NeoHybrid. Brandon Padilla Hey guys, give the Poetic Karbon a try. I'd like to know what you guys think about it. Demigod121 Still no love for the i-Blason cases? :( Kevin Slechta Spigen Slim Armor has protected my Galaxy S6 since I got it over a year ago and I will get the same for my Pixel whenever I end up getting one! oliverhaughton Ghostek makes a better looking Pixel XL case that offers all around protection and beautiful steel, not just plastic! Ghostek! Ryan I have an Incipio octane and love it. You say the buttons are terrible, they press easily every time. Not sure what's wrong with yours. The ribbed bumper is great for grip. It's nearly as grippy as my wife's tech21 Evo. benrees21 Cruzerlite Androidified A2 TPU and Carbon Cover Case for Google Pixel - Gray https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01LZ28UJ5/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_c-FDyb3G1JVJ8 Please review this! Fantastic case, buttons are nice and cutouts precise. Do a few nice colours as well. Thanks! Cristan Newton So I just found out about this company called Ghostek, which features a screen protector that is supposed to be explosion proof. Thoughts? Steve Try the Bear Motion case, I have it on my regular Pixel and I love it. But like the Google clear case, it does leave unprotected areas on the top and bottom. But I have a dbrand wrap on it also and the case still fits tight on top of the wrap.... I like to change things up on different days. https://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Slim-Case-Google-Pixel/dp/B01MA16WSH James The official Google silicoln case is sh*t. It peels or flaps away around the buttons, by design. This feels horrible. Kaya I bought an awesome phone case for my pixel which had a free screen protector and a built-in stand which helps me to view videos without even holding the phone. Here is the link for it : https://www.zizowireless.com/collections/google-pixel-cases/products/zizo-bolt-case-for-google-pixel-military-grade-glass-screen-protector ackthbbft I have the Spigen Neo Hybrid, and I'm not sure what "design flaw" the OP means about the buttons being flush with the outer frame, as mine stick out just fine. However, I will be opting for a new case, because the frame WILL break at the thinner points where it has cut-outs for the headphone jack and USB port. In fact, it did so on both sides of the USB port on mine, and so it basically came apart. I'll probably get the Spigen Rugged Armor (though it would be nice if someone would make a decent kickstand case for the Pixel). nooper No Caseology cases? They seem to be the best bang for your buck. Hope you can review the Parallax and Vault series. Impulse_Vigil Is Jon done with these reviews? Just curious, he did a fantastic job IMO. Also wondering if he or anyone has tried those super thin Peel/CaliCase type cases? They're like the thinnest possible TPU, more for scratches than bumps and drops... I'd try one but I think I care more about drop protection than anything, still curious tho, they certainly look sleek. Derek L. More please!

WSJ: How Siri went from virtual assistant market leader to laggard Internal cultural issues and employee departures have impacted Siri's evolution. Greg Sterling on June 8, 2017 at 2:04 pm More Siri has gone from being a competitive differentiator for Apple to nearly its opposite, a product seen by many as falling behind its rivals. Regardless of the empirical truth, it’s the widely-held view among tech industry insiders who help shape popular opinion. An article in the The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) provides an extensive look at how Siri went from market leader to its position as perceived laggard. The article suggests internal cultural issues and employee departures have slowed improvement of the virtual assistant: In the years since [Siri was acquired], former Siri team members say, progress has been slowed by a failure to set ambitious goals, shifting strategies and a culture that prioritizes user privacy — making it difficult to personalize and improve the product. The project also has suffered from the departures of key team members, some of whom went to competitors. Apple bought Siri in 2010. It was initially a ground-breaking addition to the iPhone. Recognizing the strategic importance of virtual assistants to the future of (conversational) search, Google enhanced its voice search capabilities and developed comparable functionality for Android devices. Just this past month it brought a specialized Google Assistant app to the iPhone to compete directly with Siri on Apple’s flagship device. Beyond this, the WSJ reports that Apple was “caught off guard” by the Amazon Echo (as was Google). It also says that Apple “spent years developing” the just-introduced smart speaker, the HomePod. That account contradicts the popular view that Apple developed the HomePod in response to the Echo. Recent studies have generally found Google’s Assistant to be the top performer vs. its rivals. However, Siri has done well in some studies, and so have Amazon’s Alexa and Cortana. The WSJ piece suggests that Apple’s narrow focus on the iPhone, a lack of vision and some level of  complacency have cost the company “its innovation edge,” which it enjoyed early on with Siri. However, a Loup Ventures study released in April had more positive assessment of Siri’s competitiveness: Siri performed well across the board, and ultimately came in second place in our assessment. Siri’s ability to interpret user commands accurately sets it apart from the others. Command is an important category for Apple, as it continues to make a push into homes with its HomeKit. By continuing to outperform Google Assistant, Siri offers the best connection between a user’s mobile life and home life, which Amazon will struggle to do without an integrated smartphone platform. As I wrote in January, Apple helped mainstream virtual assistants. Seven years ago, it was a novelty feature. Now, with consumers using voice to interact with devices more frequently, “nice to have” has become “must have.” Accordingly, a weaker Siri and a stronger Google Assistant (or Amazon Alexa) will ultimately impact iPhone sales and Apple’s larger ecosystem strategy. The company has got to see and invest much more in Siri as a core utility if it wants to remain competitive.

Yahoo's shareholders on Thursday approved the $4.5 billion sale of its key businesses to Verizon. The deal is expected to close by Tuesday. AOL and Yahoo will cut 15 percent of the 14,000 workers they now employ, or about 2,100 jobs, said a person familiar with the matter who requested not to be identified discussing the cuts. USING YAHOO Verizon has a simple goal in buying Yahoo's core business: It wants to challenge Google and Facebook in the huge and lucrative field of digital advertising. But Verizon faces its own challenge in doing so, given that it will be competing against a slew of other companies also looking to break in. Verizon wants to become a strong third choice for advertisers by adding Yahoo's popular sites and billion users worldwide to its own media business, which includes AOL and Verizon's home-grown go90 video service. It can place ads on those sites, and can also combine data from visitors to those sites with AOL's ad technologies and sales teams, and possibly also personal data from Verizon mobile customers such as location and other information, in order to better target ads at individuals. Verizon has programs that use mobile-customer data for targeted ads and may combine that with data gathered by AOL and Yahoo. Verizon says customers can choose whether to participate. Yahoo and AOL are "positioned to do better together than apart," Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. But he is setting the bar low. While Verizon talks of growth from the deal, Wieser said "not declining would be a success. Five years from now, if the combined entity were the same size as it is today, I would consider that to be successful." THE VISION Verizon sees online ads — particularly targeted ads — as a potential new source of growth as the wireless industry fights for U.S. users with lower prices and other discounts. Verizon has "essentially turned into a no-growth business," said CFRA Research's Angelo Zino. The ad business would be a "big deal" for Verizon if it goes well, he said. Tim Armstrong, the former Google executive who joined AOL as CEO in 2009, has for years wanted to combine AOL with the long-declining Yahoo. Although AOL has big-name properties such as HuffPost and Engadget, it hasn't been as big of an online destination as Yahoo's mail, finance, sports and other properties. The combined business, to be called Oath, will expand its news, sports, entertainment, finance and lifestyle coverage. Like everyone else, Oath will focus on video and mobile, where consumers increasingly spend their time online. Armstrong says he wants Oath properties to be a place consumers "come and visit every day" and predicts users growing to 2 billion from 1.3 billion by 2020, with annual revenue of $10 billion to $20 billion from roughly $7 billion today. Lowell McAdam, CEO of New York-based Verizon, teased last month that this could set the stage for a new streaming video service, competing with the slew of internet-TV services already out there. Verizon already has a free mobile video service, go90, that isn't well known. ALTERNATIVES TO THE DUOPOLY Facebook and Google together draw about half the world's spending on digital ads, and in the U.S., they're even more dominant. They're also where the majority of mobile-ad dollars go, eMarketer data show. The sway Facebook and Google hold for advertisers isn't expected to change in the next few years. They had a head start on mobile. Yahoo has poured billions into acquisitions that have helped Yahoo make some leeway in mobile — but not enough. It's gotten better at doing mobile ads, but it has had no major hit apps. Still, AOL and Yahoo together provide a much-smaller No. 3 in the U.S. for advertisers looking to reach lots of people. But even if Verizon's goal is to just be happy at No. 3, there are several much smaller players that also draw advertisers. Snapchat is a niche hit with young people. Amazon has an under-the-radar ad business that supports its e-commerce dominance. Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, is expected to grow its piece of the ad pie; Microsoft will be just behind the combined AOL-Yahoo in the U.S. once the deal closes. Twitter, although it's sorting out its ad business, is a significant smaller player. Globally, several Chinese companies also rake in ad dollars. And the combined company will also have to compete for people's attention, and not just with other services that rely on ad dollars to survive. Popular sites like Amazon or Netflix also suck up time spent online, said eMarketer analyst Martin Utreras. "They've acquired these two dinosaurs and you kind of wonder, can they be successful?" Zino said. That will depend on Verizon being able to convince marketers that they know more about consumers than anyone else, he said. ___ AP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke contributed to this story.

And when I say “support,” I’m talking about Android version updates, security updates, and now telephone or online support. This morning, Google updated their support period tables to include that last bit about phone and online support.  We’ve included the tables below, but basically, if you own a Nexus 6P or Nexus 5X, you have both phone and online support until September 2018. If you own a Nexus 9 or Nexus 6, you have until October 2017. As you can tell, those dates match the end of security updates, which Google has said is exactly when the phone and online support is supposed to stop. As for Pixel and Pixel XL owners, you have the same setup. Google plans to offer security updates through October 2019 and so that means telephone and online support end then too. Keep in mind that this type of support is different from warranties on their products. For that info, Google is directing all owners to the warranty center. Via: Google Support Post navigation Previous StoryAndroid O Developer Preview 3 Factory Images Available Next StoryLatest Android O Developer Preview Features Finalized APIs bochinchero I bought my cherished N6 in July 2015 when I got my invite. Instantly dumped VZW for a $200 ETF (but sold my VZW Note 3 for $190). The N6 had an attractive discounted price, which was cool. Although the “guaranteed” Android version cutoff was Oct. 2016, I just got the June 2017 7.1.1 update from them. However, you have to install it manually. I’m pleased that these updates are still available. No Fi phones since the N6 look good to me, so we’ll see what comes out later this year. Tyler Honestly these phones should get the latest version of their version. Ie for the Nexus 6P it should get 8.X.X since it’s so similar to 8.0. Cheryl Correll I am a 65yr old woman and I care. I have a Project Fi 5x and a Nexus 5. Don’t think you miiniums are the only Voice Google should hear. I use my phones for everything so tell your grannies to drop their apple phones and start being players. The brain keeps growing if you use it. douglas ruopp This is exactly why I’m looking at Apple products, at least they offer years of support. I’ve been android forever and I’m sick of getting a new phone (s8 plus) and being stuck on 7.0 for 850$. I want patched and updates. Pixel should be supported for 4 years minimum. Hello Apple your starting to pull me in Larry Bublitz Two years for OS updates and three years for security updates? I really was hoping the Pixel would be better. Apple is still supporting the iPhone 5s in the latest 10.3 (and probably 11 this fall), and the 5s is a 2013 phone. I’m currently using a Nexus 5 (2013 phone) locked at 6.01 stock. I just think Google should do better. (Yes, I know you can do ROMs and all that.) Abhishek Saral Yeah iOS 11 is supported in iPhone 5S that means it will get updates till 2018. A 2013 device! Thinker On the other hand, iPhone 5s from 2013 will be getting iOS 11 later this year. moohaha81 If I’m paying $500+ for an electronic device, it shouldn’t be completely obsolesced within a year and a half. A typical phone contract (for those who had them) were two years from sign up. If I buy a phone six months after release and pay full price, why should I not get the same amount of support release day consumers receive? I will never again buy a new Google phone unless it is very near release day. Under this concept, the price of the phone actually gets MORE expensive as time goes on, because you are going to receive fewer features. Sir_Brizz Premium device comparable to an iPhone. No compromises. hkklife Google is only about compromises these days. Spankey Flash a new rom that is supported by the dev. atc-tech And then you can’t use Android pay or Netflix, and possibly soon, lots of others…. Google knows exactly what Google is doing. ozo012 Magisk is easy enough to set up and use to hide root. I’m using Android Pay and Pokemon Go in my Nexus 6p. Averix Average users shouldn’t have to go through that unsupported pain to get updates. I hate this as a solution. jimv1983 Google has certainly went beyond these dates for security updates. I didn’t stop getting security updates on my Nexus 10 until sometime in the second half of last year. Suicide_Note This is handy, i suppose, but since i buy a new phone every year, it really doesn’t matter to me. Heck, Google could shorten the support window to 18 months for new devices and i wouldn’t care. #BuysANewPhoneEveryYearMasterRace RiceCake So would that kill the support feature​in settings? Are they going to remove it or just leave it sitting there? BobButtons ROM community FTW. My 2014 original Tab S is running Nougat without a hitch. I shouldn’t have to rely on sources outside of the manufacturer but it beats nothing. BaldyPal Nexus 7 2013 is still running strong! Zos Xavius I need to replace the screen on mine. I miss it. mcdonsco Never matters to me. Never keep phones long enough. If I keep a phone for 6 months it will be a record for me; at least in last 2-3 years. If over a year, that would be an all time record for me since the first smart phones (treo’s etc). Frank Rustyak I think you’re definitely in the minority. Most hold onto their phones longer because they like them or they can’t afford to switch every six months. mcdonsco I know I’m in the minority, of course. jstew182 What about the Pixel C? K77bkny Pixel C just got Lineage OS support CabbageHeadCat. Three years of security updates is good for me. As my Pixel will be replaced with the new one this fall. I would like to say that I would like them to support the OS with updates for three years. Because it would be nice for people that take care of their hardware to be able to save some cash and not force an update on a two year cycle. Carriers putting their thumb in the scales. Steve And this is why AOSP is great! Phil reading this made my pixel feel old…. 🙁 Snowbo13 The pixel feel old to me whenever I hold one with that bezel. Still rocking my used 6p that I bought when I could not order the pixel due to inventory shortages. Triston Chavez paid a small premium and got an unopened one off ebay shortly after release (Google edition). The bezels feel classy to me I’m not overly impressed by infinity displays. my hand is going to be covering part of the screen 80% of the time due to the lack of bezels foghorn67 I’m just going to say this, if they want to win as a provider and phone manufacturer, they are going to have to do better. Some people don’t get their phone on release day, and they would love to have the latest OS for a while. The Pixel should not be full price right now. They will have only 15 months of guaranteed updates. Hell, the 6P I bought last November was not discounted on the Play Store (50-100 off if bought through Project Fi), but at that point it had less than 12 months of guaranteed updates. Francisco Peña Agree. I usually get my “new” phone 6-9 months after they are launched because I want the prices to come down. The exception is my new G6, which was already on sale for the same price as my G5 I was paying. trixnkix637 There’s a caveat with wanting that cheaper price/waiting for the price to drop and that’s the lessened update timeline. Can’t have it all my friends. foghorn67 But the price isn’t cheaper. I can’t have even 1, let alone all. trixnkix637 I got one day one. Just walked right into a store. You wouldn’t believe how easy it is. There’s Swappa. There’s ways. Everyone making excuses doesn’t mean much. Don’t get me wrong, Google is on the hook for much of the responsibility, but if you want it you can get it. Mercuie Tell that to iPhone users. mrc0mments Another reason fragmentation will never get fixed. Not that I think it’s the problem some make it out to be. But a good portion of users are always going to be using 2 to 4 year old phones and they will never see the latest software. We’ll never see 50% of users on the latest release, maybe never on the last two releases combined. Scott H We are all here because we have a specific interest – some certainly more than others. But we also have to remember that the vast majority of phone users could care less what software version they are running and have no idea about any sort of updates unless a message pops up on their phone. The users with 2-4 year old phones don’t care if they have the latest software (and have no idea if they do or not). Brian Himes Yup. My parents both have Iphones and they have pending updates that will never be installed. The average consumer could care less as long as their phone functions. Boomdizzle It’s shocking how many people I see around my parents age who come into my work all day long that have GS4’s and GS5’s still with no thoughts of upgrading as long as the phone still works. I can barely go a year with the same phone. Lol. Suicide_Note You snooze, you lose. Steve Schneider “guaranteed” is the key word here… Meaning that they can cut it off any time *after* that without warning. That doesn’t mean it’s completely end of life at that point, just that they can “guarantee” they will have releases until that point. cnccnc Every other recent phone has been cut off from updates on the date. The Nexus 5 is the most recent example. Philip October 2019 is 2½ years away. That’s three years of support total for the Pixel. By that time the Pixel 3 will be out, literally. Your 6p has 18 months of support from right now. Are you and the 33 people who upvoted you just bad at math? If you don’t care about having the”latest” phone, why do you care about having the “latest” update for a three year old phone? Boomdizzle I think we’re all agreeing on the software update side, not the phone/online support. I could care less about phone or online support, they usually point you to online articles that you can find just seaching google (of course) anyway. I care far more about the software update side, where the 5x/6p crowd only has this last O update and they’re SOL. Santos Chavez I think 3 years for OS updates and 4 for security and phone/online support would help a bit more. That way if someone waited a year to get, say, the Pixel XL, they would still have 2 whole years after that of OS updates, instead of just 1. Not to mention, this would put Google’s phones ahead of Samsung’s because they will run newer software way before Samsung’s catch up which would be a nice selling point. michael arazan Exactly. 2 things Google should copy from Apple is 3-4 years OS updates, and being able to copy and transfer your entire phone with data to another device. Especially if Google wants to charge $800+ for their devices.

The Head, Training and Development at Google News Lab, Mr Daniel Sieberg, made this known in a statement issued on Thursday in Lagos. Sieberg said that the training would be done in collaboration with the World Bank and Code for Africa to equip journalists with data journalism skills within the nine months. He said that the training would empower journalists in Africa by giving them the necessary support to better understand the web and how to use the available online. According to him, the Code For Africa Digital Journalism Initiative will take place over the next nine months in 12 major African cities. “The cities include Abuja, Lagos, Nairobi, Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban, Casablanca, Dakar, Freetown, Dares Salaam, Kampala and Yaounde. “Code For Africa is a data journalism and civic technology initiative operating across Africa that trains and supports journalists and civic activists to better understand and use web tools for news reporting and storytelling. “Training will take place in three formats and beginning from June 15 and the in-person training sessions will be held in the cities mentioned above. “In each city, we will conduct trainings in three newsrooms and trainings will be held twice a month for the duration of the initiative. “Beginning from August, a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) will be made freely available online, covering a range of web concepts and practices for digital journalists,” he said. Sieberg said that the monthly study group meet-ups would also be held in collaboration with Hacks/Hackers to provide more focused, in-person instruction. He said that the monthly meetings would take place in Cameroon, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. According to him, the web and digital tools present an interesting array of options for journalists. “However, learning how to use these tools can be a daunting task for many media people. “While the global news industry faces a knowledge challenge with regards to digital tools, Africa, by virtue of its non-digital education systems, faces even greater odds in the battle for digital integration in news and storytelling. “In Nigeria for instance, only a few of the journalism institutions offer training programmes that focus on web tools. “Many top news organisations lose out on stories due to their inability to utilise newer and more engaging digital techniques,” he said. Sieberg said that in 2016, Google announced its commitment to train one million African youth within a year, to help them create and find jobs via the web. “With the Digital Journalism Initiative, we want to contribute to the growth of Africa’s news and media ecosystem. “This is by training present and future practitioners on how to employ existing tools to tell stories. “We want to support them to create locally-relevant tools that will reshape how Africans consume news,” he said.

Yahoo’s shareholders on Thursday approved the $4.5 billion sale of its key businesses to Verizon. The deal is expected to close by Tuesday. AOL and Yahoo will cut 15 percent of the 14,000 workers they now employ, or about 2,100 jobs, said a person familiar with the matter who requested not to be identified discussing the cuts. USING YAHOO Verizon has a simple goal in buying Yahoo’s core business: It wants to challenge Google and Facebook in the huge and lucrative field of digital advertising. But Verizon faces its own challenge in doing so, given that it will be competing against a slew of other companies also looking to break in. Advertisement Verizon wants to become a strong third choice for advertisers by adding Yahoo’s popular sites and billion users worldwide to its own media business, which includes AOL and Verizon’s home-grown go90 video service. It can place ads on those sites, and can also combine data from visitors to those sites with AOL’s ad technologies and sales teams, and possibly also personal data from Verizon mobile customers such as location and other information, in order to better target ads at individuals. Verizon has programs that use mobile-customer data for targeted ads and may combine that with data gathered by AOL and Yahoo. Verizon says customers can choose whether to participate. Yahoo and AOL are “positioned to do better together than apart,” Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. But he is setting the bar low. While Verizon talks of growth from the deal, Wieser said “not declining would be a success. Five years from now, if the combined entity were the same size as it is today, I would consider that to be successful.” THE VISION Verizon sees online ads — particularly targeted ads — as a potential new source of growth as the wireless industry fights for U.S. users with lower prices and other discounts. Verizon has “essentially turned into a no-growth business,” said CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino. The ad business would be a “big deal” for Verizon if it goes well, he said. Tim Armstrong, the former Google executive who joined AOL as CEO in 2009, has for years wanted to combine AOL with the long-declining Yahoo. Although AOL has big-name properties such as HuffPost and Engadget, it hasn’t been as big of an online destination as Yahoo’s mail, finance, sports and other properties. Check out Federal News Radio's latest podcasts. The combined business, to be called Oath, will expand its news, sports, entertainment, finance and lifestyle coverage. Like everyone else, Oath will focus on video and mobile, where consumers increasingly spend their time online. Armstrong says he wants Oath properties to be a place consumers “come and visit every day” and predicts users growing to 2 billion from 1.3 billion by 2020, with annual revenue of $10 billion to $20 billion from roughly $7 billion today. Lowell McAdam, CEO of New York-based Verizon, teased last month that this could set the stage for a new streaming video service, competing with the slew of internet-TV services already out there. Verizon already has a free mobile video service, go90, that isn’t well known. ALTERNATIVES TO THE DUOPOLY Facebook and Google together draw about half the world’s spending on digital ads, and in the U.S., they’re even more dominant. They’re also where the majority of mobile-ad dollars go, eMarketer data show. The sway Facebook and Google hold for advertisers isn’t expected to change in the next few years. They had a head start on mobile. Yahoo has poured billions into acquisitions that have helped Yahoo make some leeway in mobile — but not enough. It’s gotten better at doing mobile ads, but it has had no major hit apps. Still, AOL and Yahoo together provide a much-smaller No. 3 in the U.S. for advertisers looking to reach lots of people. But even if Verizon’s goal is to just be happy at No. 3, there are several much smaller players that also draw advertisers. Snapchat is a niche hit with young people. Amazon has an under-the-radar ad business that supports its e-commerce dominance. Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, is expected to grow its piece of the ad pie; Microsoft will be just behind the combined AOL-Yahoo in the U.S. once the deal closes. Twitter, although it’s sorting out its ad business, is a significant smaller player. Globally, several Chinese companies also rake in ad dollars. And the combined company will also have to compete for people’s attention, and not just with other services that rely on ad dollars to survive. Popular sites like Amazon or Netflix also suck up time spent online, said eMarketer analyst Martin Utreras. “They’ve acquired these two dinosaurs and you kind of wonder, can they be successful?” Zino said. That will depend on Verizon being able to convince marketers that they know more about consumers than anyone else, he said. ___ AP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke contributed to this story.

Data Visualization Experts Say Search Trend Maps Are Mostly Bunk Google’s new map shows Canada’s “most misspelled words.” Google Trends has put out a map showing what is says are the "most misspelled words" in Canada so far this year. According to this visualization, people in Quebec have trouble spelling "blueberry," while in the Northwest Territories, residents struggle with "facetious" (that's a tough one for sure), and Nova Scotians aren't sure how to spell "yacht." Canadians have understandably gobbled this up—we love nothing more than comparing ourselves to others, and silly stuff like this is catnip to the media. Maps like this pop up all the time: Google did something similar in the US in May, and in Canada, they've previously tracked people's favourite donuts, province by province. Even Pornhub recently did a map of most commonly misspelled searches, state by state. Maps like these are fun, but they leave some experts rolling their eyes. "This combines two of my pet peeves," Robert Kosara, a research scientist with Tableau Software in Seattle, who does data visualization research, told me over the phone. "Maps being used in weird ways, and rankings." He recently tweeted a link to an xkcd comic poking fun at this: "Many web companies use maps like this in viral marketing, but the methodology behind them is pretty weak," a wiki dedicated to explaining the webcomic says. Random noise in the data can create what look like significant differences between regions where there really aren't any—doesn't it seem weird that this whole map of Canada doesn't just say "accommodate" and "accommodation," which are actually very hard to spell? And why are Labradorians flummoxed by "precious," and Yukon residents by "altar"? It also isn't really fair to compare Nunavut (population 37,000) to Ontario (13.9 million), for example, where the number of searches will make for vastly different denominators. Donut searches by province (2016). Image: Google Canada "If you look at a word or a search term, it's going to be some tiny fraction of a percentage," Kosara said. That can make the top word in the ranking seem like a big deal, but what was the second-most searched? The third? If we saw a top-ten list in each region, there might be more similarities across provinces, instead of such weirdly huge differences. I talked to Alexandra Hunnings at Google Canada, who noted that the visualization is based on searches relating to how to spell various words. "It isn't a poll," she said. "It boils down to what people are typing in the search bar." In a follow-up email, she explained that Google Trends data is an "unbiased sample of Google search data." It's anonymized, categorized (determining a topic for a search query) and aggregated, allowing Google to measure interest in a particular topic across search. In Canadian media, a lot was made of the fact that British Columbia's "most misspelled word" was "pneumonia," which had some people wondering if the rain had more people concerned about being sick. Nunavut's word, meanwhile, was "anxiety."

"Just picking the top [word] isn't a good way of representing what comes across as really important semantic implications," he said. "Are people googling 'pneumonia' because it's raining in BC? We have no idea." One final, and possibly quibbling, point. If people are googling how to spell something, Piper added, it doesn't mean they never knew how to spell it to begin with. The real problem, of course, are the spelling mistakes we don't even realize we're making. Correction: An earlier version of this piece said New Brunswick residents were looking up how to spell "yacht." Actually it was people in Nova Scotia. The piece has been updated.

But Verizon faces its own challenge in doing so, given that it will be competing against a slew of other companies also looking to break in. Verizon wants to become a strong third choice for advertisers by adding Yahoo's popular sites and billion users worldwide to its own media business, which includes AOL and Verizon's home-grown go90 video service. It can place ads on those sites, and can also combine data from visitors to those sites with AOL's ad technologies and sales teams, and possibly also personal data from Verizon mobile customers such as location and other information, in order to better target ads at individuals. Verizon has programs that use mobile-customer data for targeted ads and may combine that with data gathered by AOL and Yahoo. Verizon says customers can choose whether to participate. Yahoo's shareholders on Thursday approved the $4.5 billion sale of its key businesses to Verizon. The deal is expected to close by Tuesday. The combination of AOL and Yahoo will cut 15 percent of its 14,000-person workforce, or about 2,100 jobs, said a person familiar with the matter who requested not to be identified discussing details of the cuts. Yahoo and AOL are "positioned to do better together than apart," Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said. But he is setting the bar low. While Verizon talks of growth from the deal, Wieser said "not declining would be a success. Five years from now, if the combined entity were the same size as it is today, I would consider that to be successful." THE VISION Verizon sees online ads - particularly targeted ads - as a potential new source of growth as the wireless industry fights for U.S. users with lower prices and other discounts. Verizon has "essentially turned into a no-growth business," said CFRA Research's Angelo Zino. The ad business would be a "big deal" for Verizon if it goes well, he said. Tim Armstrong, the former Google executive who joined AOL as CEO in 2009, has for years wanted to combine AOL with the long-declining Yahoo. Although AOL has big-name properties such as HuffPost and Engadget, it hasn't been as big of an online destination as Yahoo's mail, finance, sports and other properties. The combined business, to be called Oath, will expand its news, sports, entertainment, finance and lifestyle coverage. Like everyone else, Oath will focus on video and mobile, where consumers increasingly spend their time online. Armstrong says he wants Oath properties to be a place consumers "come and visit every day" and predicts users growing to 2 billion from 1.3 billion by 2020, with annual revenue of $10 billion to $20 billion from roughly $7 billion today. Lowell McAdam, CEO of New York-based Verizon, teased last month that this could set the stage for a new streaming video service, competing with the slew of internet-TV services already out there. Verizon already has a free mobile video service, go90, that isn't well known. ALTERNATIVES TO THE DUOPOLY Facebook and Google together draw about half the world's spending on digital ads, and in the U.S., they're even more dominant. They're also where the majority of mobile-ad dollars go, eMarketer data show. The sway Facebook and Google hold for advertisers isn't expected to change in the next few years. They had a head start on mobile. Yahoo has poured billions into acquisitions that have helped Yahoo make some leeway in mobile - but not enough. It's gotten better at doing mobile ads, but it has had no major hit apps. Still, AOL and Yahoo together provide a much-smaller No. 3 in the U.S. for advertisers looking to reach lots of people. But even if Verizon's goal is to just be happy at No. 3, there are several much smaller players that also draw advertisers. Snapchat is a niche hit with young people. Amazon has an under-the-radar ad business that supports its e-commerce dominance. Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn, is expected to grow its piece of the ad pie; Microsoft will be just behind the combined AOL-Yahoo in the U.S. once the deal closes. Twitter, although it's sorting out its ad business, is a significant smaller player. Globally, several Chinese companies also rake in ad dollars. And the combined company will also have to compete for people's attention, and not just with other services that rely on ad dollars to survive. Popular sites like Amazon or Netflix also suck up time spent online, said eMarketer analyst Martin Utreras. "They've acquired these two dinosaurs and you kind of wonder, can they be successful?" Zino said. That will depend on Verizon being able to convince marketers that they know more about consumers than anyone else, he said. --- AP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke contributed to this story. © 2017 The Associated Press.

The previously Galaxy-exclusive app is based on the same core as Google Chrome and comes with privacy-focused features. Samsung has included its own "Internet Browser" app on its Galaxy phones for years. This week, it released the app to the Play Store in beta form. It is currently listed as "Samsung Internet Browser." Android Headlines reports that the app is still "optimized" for Galaxy phones. It is now available on some other Android handsets though, expanding the choice of web browsers available in the store. Most of its features are said to be working but some areas closely integrated with Samsung's TouchWiz UI on Galaxy devices could be buggy. Internet Browser is based on the Chromium open-source browser framework so web pages will render the same as in Google Chrome. As a modern mobile browser, it supports all the core features you'd expect, including tabbed browsing and address bar searching. There's also several unique capabilities you won't find in Chrome though, including comprehensive privacy options. When you first install the app, the search engine will be set to DuckDuckGo to minimise tracking and data collection. The browser supports third-party blocking solutions too, letting you resist being tracked online. There's a special interface that shows you content that's being blocked. Unlike Chrome, Samsung Internet Browser also has a limited selection of third-party Extensions. These work in the same way as extensions on desktop web browsers, letting you expand the available features, change the rendering of pages and even install ad-blockers. The app has a floating "Quick Menu" option that lets you pin common menu functions to the browser. The widget can be used to quickly manage tabs and share content without having to reach for the main browser menu. It improves usability on large-screen devices by putting the controls at your literal fingertips. As mobile web browsers come, Samsung Internet Browser is one of the most feature-complete available. With exclusive features that not even Chrome can claim, it's likely Samsung is giving the app a wider Play Store release to demonstrate to users the value that the app has to offer. While predominantly a Galaxy-focused app, it's unlikely anyone will buy a Samsung handset based on the web browser it includes. Samsung can better expose its brand and attract user reviews by bringing the app to the Play Store instead. You can download Samsung Internet Browser today but there are restrictive limitations over the devices that are supported. For unknown reasons, Samsung only officially allows installation Google Pixel handsets, aside from its own Galaxy line-up. Despite this, Android Police reported success in installing the app on Huawei's Ascend Mate 2, although this may be a strange edge case.

Executives from the top three public cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform—spoke at the GeekWire Cloud Tech Summit in Bellevue, Wash. this week. Here are three lessons you need to learn now. Managing partnerships is critical—and hard Microsoft (msft) and Amazon are courting major software companies to run their operations on their respective clouds, and many—Tableau (data), Salesforce (crm), Workday (wday)—are doing so. "We want to win both big customers and the software companies selling to those customers," Scott Guthrie, Microsoft's executive vice president of cloud and enterprise, said at the conference. Related: Welcome to the Era of Great Data Center Consolidation The problem is that the major cloud providers offer more than basic computing, networking, and storage building blocks. They are adding more capabilities that compete with software companies they are courting. For example, while SAP (sap) financial software runs on Microsoft Azure public cloud, SAP also competes with Microsoft Dynamics applications. As Guthrie noted: "If we overlap in places, we have to do that in disciplined ways." Guthrie, who manages both Azure cloud and financial software that competes with SAP, added: "I see SAP as both a competitor and a partner, but we're able to manage that well." Related Term SheetHouzz Worth $4 Billion in New Funding Round Term Sheet Houzz Worth $4 Billion in New Funding Round This is déjà vu for Microsoft. Years ago as the company built its Windows franchise, it wanted other software companies to move Microsoft products, which ran on the older DOS operating system. But even as the Windows team pushed third-parties like Lotus Development Corp., then a leader in DOS spreadsheet software, to move to Windows, Microsoft was building its own competitive Windows Excel spreadsheet software. This did not work out so well for Lotus, which ended up being acquired by IBM (ibm). Guthrie told Fortune that Lotus' fate had more to do with that company being late to Windows than any competition from Microsoft's competitive software. In similar fashion, Guthrie said software companies should quickly commit to cloud or risk falling behind. Seattle sees itself as 'Cloud City' Amazon Web Services (amzn), the leader in the public cloud market, was born in Seattle approximately 11 years ago. Microsoft, the second largest public cloud company, is based a few miles east in Redmond. And while Google (goog) is headquartered in Mountain View, Calif., a good chunk of its cloud development work takes place in the Seattle area. Oracle (orcl) also fields much of its nascent cloud work in the area. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. At the conference, Docker's new chief executive Steve Singh said his company will open a significant engineering hub in Seattle or Bellevue soon. Docker, which backs container technology easing the deployment of software that runs in the cloud or in company data centers, is based in San Francisco. Greg DeMichillie, director of product management for Google Cloud, said that company is constructing a new facility in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood to house more Google cloud personnel. "If you look at the rate at which we are hiring, not just in engineering, our growth here in Seattle is pretty phenomenal,” DeMichillie said. Google also has offices in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. Cloud is about running applications, new and old Fortune 500 companies run lots of decades-old business software, simply patched up and updated over time. Databases, financial accounting systems, and software managing manufacturing tasks all fall into that category. Cloud providers think much of that key business software should move from corporate data centers to the cloud—but such migrations are difficult. Guthrie, however, said most of Azure's cloud business comes from truly new computing jobs that have never ran in anyone's data center. The Internet of things–in which billions of connected devices from fitness gadgets to appliances to factory gear in order to gather data—is partially responsible for enabling those new scenarios. "We haven’t seen a huge lift and shift of existing things until recently," Guthrie said. "I think Amazon would say the same thing. Core IT hasn’t been lifting and shifting core workloads until lately." Related: Microsoft Claims Shipping Giant Maersk as Huge Cloud Win Brand new computing tasks—like German auto giant BMW's connected car work, which brings the driver's smartphone, contacts, calendar into the car itself—could not happen without a cloud. Projects like this, Guthrie added, are not necessarily driven by traditional IT staff, but by business units at the company. Brian Nowak, executive director at Morgan Stanley, agreed that much cloud work—and revenue—is driven by totally new tasks like these. "Autonomous cars didn't even exist two years ago," Nowak noted. Connected home devices, like Amazon Echo, are also new. The data that these gadgets collect needs to be analyzed in the cloud, he explained, and that is driving the bulk of public cloud business going forward.

The internet in rich countries will be unrecognizable from the rest of the world’s in five years Written by Joon Ian Wong June 08, 2017 Looking for a shorter connection. (Reuters/Benoit Tessier) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong June 08, 2017 The internet is being reshaped by private networks owned by the world’s tech giants: firms like Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google. The majority of internet traffic already flows over such private networks, called content delivery networks (CDNs), but that proportion is set to increase to over 70% of global internet traffic over the next five years, according to Cisco’s annual forecast of internet traffic trends. CDNs are used to improve user experience of some types of online media, especially video streams. While they are not new, they are exerting increasing impact on the topology of the internet because of the sheer amount of traffic they handle. Such networks were typically run by third-party telecommunications firms that dealt with enterprises, firms like Akamai or Limelight Networks. But the rise of video streaming over the internet has meant rapidly rising investment by consumer-facing companies like Netflix, Google, and Facebook. The rising proportion of traffic flowing over CDNs has led to a phenomenon known as the “flattening” of the internet. The dominance of CDNs is going to be more pronounced in some regions, particularly wealthy areas like North America, western Europe and Asia Pacific, according to Cisco. For example, 91% of all internet traffic in North America will flow over a CDN by 2021, compared to just 31% in the Middle East and Africa. Here’s the breakdown: Tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, or Google are increasingly investing in their own CDNs to ship bits to their users. The proportion of traffic flowing over these proprietary networks will also be more pronounced in wealthier regions, Cisco predicts. Some 60% of all internet traffic will flow over a private CDN—one set up by a firm to serve its customers, like Netflix, for instance—in North America in 2021. Ten percent of internet traffic in the Middle East and Africa will flow over a private CDN in that year, Cisco forecasts. Users who are well served by CDNs will have better online experiences: They will get buffer-free movies, stream live video smoothly, or get lag-free video gaming experiences. “Each kilometer or mile or distance that video content has to travel degrades or reduces the level of quality of that experience,” says Thomas Barnett, who led work on the report at Cisco. Does the lag in CDN service in some regions create the potential for a new digital divide? Barnett doesn’t think so. “We’ve seen this trend with all technologies,” he says. “I think CDNs like everything else, the cost will go down … Ultimately when the GDP and overall economic situations improve, and there’s demand for these services, we’ll see further investment there.” Read this next: The internet has been quietly rewired, and video is the reason why Most Popular The days and nights of Elon Musk: How he spends his time at work and play Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search
Vanity Fair hive Sign In/Up business technology politics the players hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology The Players Sign In/Up Hey Siri America’s Most Valuable Company May Be in Danger Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Hey Siri America’s Most Valuable Company May Be in Danger Is Tim Cook falling behind? by Maya KosoffJune 8, 2017 10:24 am Email Facebook Twitter By David Paul Morris/Bloomberg. When Apple released the iPhone 4S in 2011, it touted a major innovation that no other device at the time could claim: a voice-activated virtual personal assistant, Siri. Siri was unlike anything else on the market at the time; you could ask it questions about the weather, use it to perform complex calculations, and have Siri make calls and send texts for you. But while Apple stayed focused on upgrading its flagship product, the iPhone, through the years, other competitors developed their own voice-activated assistants. Google Now launched in 2012, and Amazon launched Alexa and Echo in 2014, which, in addition to answering Siri-like queries, could do things like turn off the lights in your home. Microsoft announced its own personal-assistant software, Cortana, the same year. As artificial intelligence advances, voice-activated digital assistants are quickly becoming the next frontier in consumer technology. But Apple, which was once a pioneer in the market, is now playing catch-up with its rivals. On Monday, Apple announced its own stand-alone product to compete with Amazon’s Echo and Google Home: the HomePod, which the company is promoting as a sort of sophisticated music speaker with Siri built in. But HomePod, which Apple spent years developing, is still nowhere near as sophisticated as competing products. As The Wall Street Journal reports, Siri’s progress has been slowed for a number of reasons, including the departures of some Siri team members and a slow pace of innovation (possibly due to the fact that the iPhone is still Apple’s flagship product). Apple’s commitment to user privacy—as well as its relative lack of user data, compared to Google and Amazon—has also limited its ability to personalize Siri or anticipate users’ needs. Although Apple’s stock has risen dramatically under the guidance of C.E.O. Tim Cook, some critics suggest his company has coasted on the success of the iPhone and failed to deliver a new breakthrough product. Apple executives say Siri is improving. In an interview with the Journal, Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue boasted that Apple switched Siri to a machine-learning system, which improved the software’s performance. “The key about things like Siri is to make it not feel like something you have to think about,” he said. Apple is also punching above its weight when it comes to searches: while Siri fields 2 billion requests per week, it’s competing against Google, which, by the estimate of Danny Sullivan, who covers Google and search marketing, completes about 3.85 billion voice searches a day. But developers remain disappointed. In 2016, Apple announced 150 new intents, or commands, for Siri at its WWDC developers’ conference—still far fewer than the 12,000 available with Amazon. “People went from being happy and excited to sitting in workshops and realizing, ‘I can’t use it,’” Brian Roemmele, a developer who attended the conference, told the Journal. “Some went back to that attitude: Siri’s always going to be dumb. They moved on to developing for Google and Alexa.” Share Email Facebook Twitter Maya KosoffMaya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

Did they just see that? And did he just take their photo? Wearing a San Fransisco Giants hat, a gray t-shirt and khakis, Ernest Carreras walked down Monroe Avenue Thursday, June 8, wearing a Google Street View camera backpack or "Trekker," as the company calls it. Carreras is in the middle of a cross-country trip to capture images of pedestrian walkways that their cars cannot access for Google Street View. On his hit list for Grand Rapids was the Blue Bridge, Gillett Bridge and some other small walkways in the area. He is in Michigan for the weekend, then headed south to Indianapolis. After that he continue on through the East Coast. Before getting the job with Google, he had never left California. How did he score the job? "I just went to Google.com and they had this job title called Special Collects Operator and that's what I do," Carreras said. The camera backpack itself weighs about 40 pounds and has 15 cameras mounted to it to provide the 360-degree view. The backpack has 1.8 terabytes, or 1800 gigabytes, of storage available for the photos it takes. This isn't the first time Google Street View cameras have trekked through Michigan. Pictured Rocks and Sleeping Bear Dunes have been photographed recently by Google mappers like Carreras.

Knowing what you need to do and when you need to do it ensures that nothing gets forgotten. But most task management solutions keep these two things separate. Sure, you can see your due dates in your to-do list app, but wouldn’t it be nicer to see them on your calendar, where all of your events are listed? Here’s how you can. In the examples below, we’ll be using Google Calendar. Why Google Calendar? First, because it’s extremely popular. Almost everyone already has a personal or professional Gmail account, and that means they have Google Calendar, too. Second, because Google Calendar can sync with just about anything. If you prefer to use iCal, you can easily sync them up. Fantastical? The Windows calendar How to Sync Your Google Calendar with the Windows 10 Taskbar How to Sync Your Google Calendar with the Windows 10 Taskbar Sync your Google Calendar with the Windows Calendar app wasn't always possible. Since the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, you can even manage your Google, iCloud, and Outlook calendars from the Taskbar. We show you how. Read More ? No problem. Syncing them can be done in a couple easy steps. For this reason, Google Calendar is a great central place to manage your task list. And last but not least, Google Calendar works with both IFTTT and Zapier, which means you can make it work with almost any other app. Advertisement The Easiest Option: Google Tasks As you might expect, Google’s own Tasks app Five Killer Ways to Use Google Tasks Five Killer Ways to Use Google Tasks If you're like me, you spend more time managing your tasks than you do actually performing them. It’s all about multiple lists, offline access and getting your tasks on-the-go. Since we last took a look... Read More is tightly integrated with Google Calendar. It’s not an advanced task management system, and it doesn’t offer a whole lot of features. But if you just need a place to jot down what you need to do and you want to see due dates in your calendar, it’ll do the job. To access Tasks, go to calendar.google.com and click Tasks under My Calendars in the left sidebar. If you don’t see the link for Tasks, click the down arrow next to Reminders and select Switch to Tasks. You’ll now see your task list displayed to the right of the calendar, as well as reminders on the days you set your tasks to be due. You can also open Tasks in Gmail by clicking the dropdown menu in the top-left (it says “Mail” when you’re looking at your inbox). Tasks shows up much like an instant message. And if you want to see Tasks in full size, go to mail.google.com/tasks/canvas. You won’t get any more features, but you do get a full tab to work with. In any view, click the right-facing arrow next to a task to add a due date. You can also add notes or assign it to a specific list. Once you’ve assigned a due date, you’ll see that task displayed on Google Calendar. It’s as simple as that. Syncing Your To-Do List With Google Calendar Are you using a different task manager already? There’s a good chance that you can sync it with Google Calendar. I’m currently using Remember the Milk, for example, and I can sync it just by adding the Google Calendar gadget: Wunderlist is similarly easy. Just open the app and head to Preferences > Account. From there, you can click Calendar Feed: Connect. It might open another calendar app, but you can copy and paste the calendar feed URL into Google Calendar to sync it up. Most other task management apps have some sort of calendar integration Awesome Things You Can Automatically Import To Google Calendar Awesome Things You Can Automatically Import To Google Calendar A calendar keeps every aspect of your life focused in one place, allowing you to worry less and accomplish more.

For almost any task management system, there’s a good way to sync it with Google Calendar built right in. Just consult the app’s documentation to find out how to sync it up. Going the Custom Way: Using an Automation Service If your system isn’t currently amenable to syncing with Google Calendar, you do have another option. Zapier and IFTTT can connect a huge number of apps together, and many of them allow you to sync up Google Calendar. For example, here are the task list and project management apps that Zapier supports: Asana Todoist Wunderlist Google Tasks Omnifocus Producteev Toodledo Week Plan Nozbe Remember the Milk Checkvist Focuster Zenkit (beta) Setting up an automation using Zapier or IFTTT is super easy. In most cases, there’s already one that’s been created, and all you need to do is add it to your account. Here’s one that adds Evernote reminders to your Google Calendar: Other to-do-type apps can be integrated, too. IFTTT lets you add your follow-up reminders from Followup.cc to Google Calendar so you can always see who you need to be emailing and when.

Just add your tasks, use gestures to reorganize them, and you’ll see when you need to get your things done. As of right now, Sorted doesn’t support syncing with Google Calendar. However, the developers have stated that calendar integration is very high on their list of features to add. Until then, however, you could use Sorted as your primary calendaring app. How Do You Stay in Sync? There are plenty of ways to sync your to-do list with Google Calendar. The degree to which you want to sync it and how many details you’d like to share between the two, however, depends largely on your own personal task management system.

Though neither brand has officially announced the news of the collaboration yet, images of the product have appeared on social media, and the glittery packaging alone is making our tiny millennial hearts skip a beat. {Instagram}  Modeling agencies head west With the line between professional models and Hollywood talent more blurred than ever, many top modeling agencies — including IMG Models and Wilhelmina — are setting up shop in Los Angeles. The biggest draw? The chance to sign influential celebrity spawn, many of whom grew up and live in the LA-area. {The Hollywood Reporter} Google is digitizing the world's fashion archives  Having spent time digitizing the world's museum collections since 2010, Google is now turning its attention to archiving the past 3,000 years of global fashion. Called "We Wear Culture," the initiative will both enrich Google's Arts & Culture platform and make fashion and its history more accessible to those who are culturally curious and may not be able to see shows or exhibits in person. {Business of Fashion}  Boohoo sends celeb kids to the Hamptons Fast-fashion site Boohoo has enlisted celeb kids Sailor Brinkley Cook and Elisa Johnson to star in its summer campaign, photographed in the Hamptons.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Pixel 2 and the strategy war with iPhone 8 Chris Burns - Jun 8, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit This morning we’re having a look at what Google’s Pixel 2, Pixel XL 2, and Pixel XXL 2 will be. The names for these next devices are not set – not publicly anyway. Final details for the next set of Google Pixel phones, be they a set of 2 or a set of 3, likely hinges partially on Apple’s plans for their 2017 set of iPhone devices. Will Google copy Apple’s plan? Short answer: no, that’s crazy talk. Lead times and required times for manufacturing don’t line up well for Google deciding on which Pixels to make with regard to iPhone sales. Instead, Google would – potentially – need to rely on rumors and leaked details for Apple’s next collection in order to make necessary moves in the market for a timely release. This is because of Google’s chosen yearly release schedule. Last year, for example, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL were revealed in October. Apple revealed their iPhone 7 collection in September of 2016, and in September of 2015 Apple revealed the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. It’s the trends that we’re watching most closely, here. Of course there’s always the possibility Google might release Pixel 2 early. Proof in the already public code pudding What’s interesting about the most public information available about Google’s next set of devices is the frequency with which they’re called out. Each time a code change to AOSP – the Android Open Source Project – is made and applied to a set of devices, it’s mentioned in the notes. These notes are available at the Android Open Source Project Gerrit listing site. Searching the site for the three code names of Google’s next several devices reveals the frequency with which they’re used as testing devices. These devices, in order of presumed display size, are: Walleye, Muskie, Taimen. The device with the fewest appearances is Taimen, followed by Walleye. The device that appears the most is Muskie. That device which, if history teaches us anything, is the device that’ll be closest to the Google Pixel XL. The idea that Google is using the XL of this bunch to test the most might – MIGHT – indicate that it’s the device Google favors the most. You’ll notice also that the first round of reviews of the Google Pixel smartphone lineup were – for the most part – made up of Google Pixel XL units. It could also be that it’s the Google XL that saw the best sales of the two in the first round of the Pixel being public. I feel like it’s safe to assume that Google’s work on AOSP would require only one device to be the main testing phone while the others are tested less frequently in one most-plausible case. That is that the next round of Pixel smartphones, be it 2 or 3 devices released at once, will be released with the same parts. For the most part, that is. The battery sizes will probably be different, and the displays will obviously be different sizes. But like the first round, the Pixel 2, XL 2, and XXL 2, will almost certainly be nearly identical in their implementation. Will Pixel 2 beat iPhone for price? The starting price of a Google Pixel is $649 USD – or $769 for the Pixel XL. If you look at the way Google sells the Pixel on their Google Store, they only really reveal the “XL” part in the buy screen – as if a larger display is a choice not unlike choosing a color for the phone, or storage size. Apple’s store shows the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus as two different phones. The iPhone 7 costs $649, while the iPhone 7 Plus costs $769. The prices of Apple’s main two iPhones match those of Google’s Pixel phones. If Apple releases an iPhone OLED model, it won’t likely have a display larger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus. It’s rumored to sit between the smaller and the larger iPhone, with a price that’s higher than that of the iPhone 7 Plus because of its premium features. If what we’ve gathered about the Google Pixel XXL (or whatever it’ll be called) above is true, Google’s newest device will cost more than the XL, too. But will Google’s entire lineup gain a set of border-less displays that resemble those of the iPhone OLED model? That’s the KEY question. As it is with devices rumored and tipped before their official reveal by their makers, take the entirety of the information gathered here with a grain of salt. Don’t make any giant cash bets on the possibilities here – but keep them in mind when heading in to the summer season for buying a new phone.

Google Phone 9.0 prepares to add Android O's Notification Channels, picture messaging, post-call messages, and more [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 5:00am PDTMay 2, 2017 81 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares249 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Update 1: 2017/05/10 3:16pm PDT Official changelog posted Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Notification Channels for Android O 1.2 Post-call messaging 1.3 Convenient picture messaging 1.4 Motorola "hidden menu" dialer codes 1.5 Cat and dog paws? 2 Download Late last week, an update to Google's Phone app began rolling out with no immediately obvious changes to the experience. While users don't have anything to play with quite yet, there are several interesting hints about what is to come in future releases. Hidden among the app's resources are signs of support for Android O's new Notification Channels feature, in-call picture messaging, post-call messaging, hidden menu codes for Motorola phones, and even some odd images of paws. Yes, seriously. Update 1: 2017/05/10 3:16pm PDT Official changelog posted Google posted a changelog for the Phone app's latest update with the addition of emergency location display and "call waiting improvements" making up the majority of the new features. Emergency location display Call waiting improvements (accept second call and end ongoing call) Bug fixes Needless to say, I wasn't going to test anything that may relate to emergency services, but I did try testing the call waiting function. There weren't any visible changes for me, so it's possible these are really under-the-hood improvements or something that doesn't work on my cell carriers. End of Update Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Notification Channels for Android O While it's a fairly small feature when compared to some of the improvements we've seen in many major OS updates, the Notification Channels brought to us by Android O are exciting. Most of Google's apps are still not implementing this addition to the API, but it's clearly in the works with the Phone app. While they don't appear to be fully implemented yet, names have been added to the latest apk update that describe six separate channels, including: Incoming calls, Ongoing calls, Missed calls, Voicemails, External calls, and Miscellaneous. <string name="notification_channel_incoming_call">Incoming calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_ongoing_call">Ongoing calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_missed_call">Missed calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_voicemail">Voicemails</string> <string name="notification_channel_external_call">External calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_misc">Miscellaneous</string> That's a pretty thorough list given the nature of the Phone app and the types of notifications it shows, especially since most users will probably never even see a couple of them. While the strings are there, only the standard Miscellaneous channel is visible in the notification settings screen for the Phone app. In all likelihood, the implementation probably wasn't complete when this update was built, so we can probably expect to see it in the next release, or possibly when the second developer preview image becomes available. Post-call messaging Receive a phone call today on almost any modern phone and you can probably tap or swipe something on the screen to reject it and immediately reply with a pre-written text message to say you're unavailable or will call back shortly. It can be a useful feature, even if it's just for those times when you're driving or stuck in a meeting. But what should the caller do if they don't get through? Leaving a voicemail is turning to be too cumbersome, so many people now send a text instead. New lines in this update suggest the same type of prepared text messages might be added for the caller, as well. There are a few new lines going into this feature, but three are the new, pre-written messages meant to convey varying degrees of importance. They are simple messages crafted to let the target of the call know that your needs are urgent, important but not time sensitive, or you just called to chat. <string name="post_call_add_message">Add message</string> <string name="post_call_message">Say why you called</string> <string name="post_call_message_1">This is urgent. Call me back.</string> <string name="post_call_message_2">Call me back when you have some time.</string> <string name="post_call_message_3">Not urgent, we can chat later.</string> <string name="post_call_message_sent">Message sent</string> There aren't any other clues to suggest how this feature will be presented to the caller or if a custom message can be written from the same screen, but it's likely this feature wasn't complete yet, either. Unless some clever tricks are necessary to make this feature smart, it seems like there probably won't have to be too much more work, so it may go live with the next update. Convenient picture messaging For many years, phone manufacturers have experimented with bringing certain features to the surface during calls so users don't have to spend too much time poking at their phone to do things that people are likely to need in the moment. One feature that has been popping up occasionally, even as far back as the days of dumb phones, was the ability to quickly take a picture and send it directly to the person in the same conversation. It looks like the same feature is probably destined for Google's Phone app. <string name="received_a_photo">Received a photo</string> <string name="sent_a_photo">Sent a photo</string> There are a few other strings possibly related to this feature, but the two above are the only ones that really matter. They represent the basic status messages to show a picture was sent or received. Again, it's not really clear if there are any clever features that make this a little smarter, but I have a hunch the Phone app will listen for messages containing images (I assume both MMS and RCS) and instead of making users switch to their messaging app, the photos will be shown automatically or with an on-screen button. Motorola "hidden menu" dialer codes Hacking around with a phone can be fun and enable a lot of powerful features, but it often involves a lot of secret methods that aren't intended for the public. Dialer codes have been used as one of the key methods for accessing special menus and functions. A long list of Motorola's dialer codes was included in the latest Phone update. Some of these are pretty old, but at least a few of them didn't turn up in any of my searches, so I thought some people might want to experiment with them. Disclaimer: Use of these dialer codes is done at your own risk. Some of these may damage your phone and/or void its warranty. You've been warned. If you want some information on many of these codes, you can find about 3/4 of them listed in this 2012 post by well-known security expert JCase. The behavior of the remaining codes is currently unknown and didn't turn up in my research. Only try them out if you know what you're doing and prepared for the possible consequences. code <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_sequence"> <item>\##66236#</item> <item>\##2539#</item> <item>\##786#</item> <item>\##72786#</item> <item>\##3282#</item> <item>\##33284#</item> <item>\##3424#</item> <item>\##564#</item> <item>\##4567257#</item> <item>\##873283#</item> <item>\##6343#</item> <item>\##27263#</item> <item>\##258#</item> <item>\##8422#</item> <item>\##4382#</item> </string-array> <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_pattern"> <item>\##[0-9]{6}#</item> </string-array> <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_pattern_intents"> <item>@string/motorola_hidden_menu_intent</item> </string-array> Cat and dog paws? Finally, a couple of quirky images were added to this update. A pair of paws, one belonging to a cat and the other to a dog, can now be found in the apk's resources. Note: Images were converted from webp to png. I'm not yet sure what they are used for, if they belong to an Easter egg, or maybe somebody at Google just wanted to make sure we were still watching. Both images have transparent backgrounds and look like they could be used for a simple animation where a paw reaches up to grab an object on the screen and drag it away. Whatever the case, ya gotta love the whimsy and humor. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Even hitting the Message button on a contact won't work. They really need to allow Voice to be the default SMS app makapav Well done bro. You're a fellow dedicated Google Voice user to figure that out and complain about it. I wanted to bring that use case here to my rant but figured probably no one else jumps through that hoop like me! ;-) Clearly Google has the laziest/clueless Android users on their team because some of these obvious use cases go unknown to them. chocolate_drizzle I think they should add seemless Google Duo integration by adding a video calling option in the app. What do you guys think? DynamikD I think you are on to something! 👍 bunchofpenguins Facetime does this where you can press a button and switch right to Facetime. I have been wanting this in Android forever. Chris My girlfriend and I enjoy using Duo all the time, so this would be perfect. But then Google would need to release their Phone app for all Android phones in the Play Store. Carson Saldanha No, they could just add support for it in their own. Andy J If the photo features are indeed for RCS (and sending photos while in a phone call is indeed a feature specifically detailed in the RCS spec) - then in the same way Messages is available to all Android phones, the phone app would also have to be on the store. And the Contacts app will probably go on too - because a key part of the RCS spec is that the phone address book will show which contacts have "enhanced messaging" available. Chris I hope so. I love the Google Dialer and Contacts but I have to use an old APK to get it to run on non Nexus or Pixel devices. Deeco Too logical for Google JG I could see where that could come in handy... However I'm not sure if Duo has picked up enough traction to really make it useful enough to integrate it into the dialer. If the recipient doesn't have Duo installed (as possibly would be the case the majority of the time - at least from personal experience) then a Duo video call button would just be extra clutter... Berni Hargrove But this is how you give it traction. Intuitively integrate it into a regularly used feature/app of the phone. The dialer is a perfect fit to help give Duo more relevance. Biga173rd Does this APK work with non pixel phones? Siddharth Nope except Nexus devices Biga173rd Thanks Cody Toombs It's meant for a few things people forget, but definitely not all phones. The full list should be: Pixel, Nexus, Android One, and Motorola. Carpentractor Ok, I have been experiencing a weird bug with my Pixel keypad while in call. Basically, the keypad gets smushed when accessing the keypad in call and it cuts off the letters ​under the numbers, which are sort of useful when spelling last names for extensions... It happened to me several updates ago and uninstalling all of the updates for the app and putting it back to how the phone came originally would fix that issue, but obviously take away any new features that have been added to the dialer. But, this time when I tried to uninstall the app updates, it didn't fix the issue! Everytime I see an update for the dialer, I get excited that they may have fixed it, but to no avail. My girlfriend has a Nexus 5X and she does not have the issue. I have attached a screenshot, please let me know if anyone has a solution or is even experiencing the issue. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd8b277825ef665ffa607ce2aa8b3a0004b8109cba32e68655dcd11afd7834ec.png DynamikD I, personally, have never experienced this and I have the same device as you. By any chance, are you running any 3rd party app(s) that also integrated into the dialer? Carpentractor I don't think so, I did have Skype installed at one point, but I did uninstall it. What kind of 3rd party apps might integrate with the dialer? I guess I can try to boot up in safe mode.... Rod What's your font size? Carpentractor Large. Carpentractor So, I changed my font back to default and it did solve the problem. Is there no way to have my font set to large and have the dialer format properly? My girlfriend has her font set to large with no issues on her 5x. This is whacky! Rod Have you changed the DPI? Carpentractor Not as far as anything beyond having my display size also set to large. Morenicano $5 says this will be a new messenger app by next year Richard Dennis and they will move half of Allo's features to it.. So you now need both apps... And hangouts is a new email app. Yuku Sugianto Why do Motorola codes appear on Google's Phone app? Probably the next Nexus/Pixel line phone will be made by Motorola, and Motorola service staff are already accustomed to those codes to diagnose problems. Cody Toombs Sorry to kill this theory, but Motorola has a arrangement with Google to use a lot of Google's first party apps. It's been in place basically since Google bought it and began shipping the Moto X with nearly stock AOSP with some product specific enhancements. As far as I am aware, all (or most?) Motorola phones use Google's Phone app. Even if that weren't the explanation, the Nexus 6 would be. I mean, a Moto-made Pixel could still happen, but these phone codes aren't evidence of that. Kevin Burton Could the "paws" be for sequence dialing? When a "pause" is entered you get a "paw" displayed on the phone? AintaDamnThingFunny I like the phone app. My only complaint is it's not the most intuitive thing on earth to try and answer/reject a call by swiping up/down. I routinely need 3 or 4 tries to get it. Or maybe it's just me? I think swiping side to side is easier. Maxr1998 "somebody at Google just wanted to make sure we we're still watching" - that one "we" seems to be too much 😜 SomeGuy112 I notice the button animation is gone when pressing the button to bring up the dialer now.

I got a notification for your recent "Paw Mode" video, and in that video description, you've linked here. I saw that the article didn't mention about your finding, and I commented that.

For the most part, though, Maps and other GPS technologies only help you navigate public and some private streets and roads, but becomes useless when you enter a building. However, slowly but surely, Google Maps has been adding internal specs for public buildings, and now it appears to be adding the layouts of major subway stations. UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases First noticed by a user on Reddit, by adding the transit layer onto their view of New York City, they were able to see the internal layout of Pennsylvania Station. Another commentator on the post was able to reproduce it for stations in Shinjuku, Tokyo Central, Yokohama, Osaka, and Tanukikoji. Although Google Maps is now showing the layout of these subway stations, it doesn’t add any additional details. So while you’re able to see the physical structures of the building and the train platforms, you won’t be able to see where ticket stands or food vendors might be located. Google has yet to make any formal announcement about these additions to Maps. As they are not showing up for everyone and not every subway station’s layout has been added yet, it would appear that Google is still working on this update. Hopefully, when finished, there will be added details to help users navigate once inside these stations.

Show More Android's Smart Lock feature is spectacular -- that is, when it actually works. Smart Lock has been around since 2014's Android 5.0 era. The basic idea behind it is to make securing your smartphone less inconvenient, thus making it more likely that you'll actually use a pattern, PIN, or passcode to keep your data safe. The sensational headlines about big, bad malware monsters lurking in the dark and waiting to pounce on unsuspecting victims may be scary, after all -- but here in the real world, you're far more likely to suffer from your own self-made security shortcomings than from any sort of theoretical threat. So, yeah: Smart Lock makes an awful lot of sense -- from both the perspective of an individual consumer and that of a company that wants to minimize the hassle of proper security for its users. The only problem is that one of the most useful Smart Lock options has been broken for way too long. I'm talking about Smart Lock's Trusted Places feature, which lets you set a specific physical location -- like your home or your office -- at which your phone will automatically stay unlocked. When you aren't at that location, your standard security method will show up and apply. The feature was fantastic when it first came along, but at some point, it just stopped working consistently. It's something I've experienced with numerous Android devices, including my own current personal phone. [ Further reading: 16 Android tips and tricks you shouldn't miss ] I was excited, then, to see word last week that Google had supposedly fixed the glitch. A message posted by a Googler in an official help forum said an update to Google Play Services was rolling out and would bring proper functionality back to Smart Lock Trusted Places. Huzzah! At last, a solution. Or so it seemed. The Play Services update was already on my current phone (a Pixel), my old phone (a Nexus 6P), and my wife's phone (a Nexus 5X) -- and yet Trusted Places still failed to work for any of those devices. Hang on, though: There's a silver lining to this story. I mentioned my disappointment with Google's ineffective fix on social media, and someone had a suggestion. I gave the proposed workaround a go on all three of the aforementioned phones -- and after a week of testing and observation, I'm here to tell you that it absolutely works. It doesn't make much sense, mind you, and there's no reason you should have to do this. But if Smart Lock Trusted Places is flaky for you, it's worth giving a whirl. Here's all you've gotta do: Head into the Security section of your system settings and find the option for Smart Lock. You'll probably have to enter your security code before moving on to the next menu. Select "Trusted Places," then tap the line for whatever location isn't working properly and select the option to edit it. Tap the map that appears, then slide your finger around to move the red pin to the most accurate location. Even if the location looks right from the get-go, shift it around a teensy bit to force the system to update it. This will likely change the text you see on the screen from a specific street address (which you probably typed in at some point) to a set of latitude and longitude coordinates. Tap the "Update" command at the bottom of the screen, then hit your device's Home key to exit back to the home screen. That's it -- and nonsensical as it sounds, it should do the trick. At least, it did for all three phones I've been testing in my house, all of which have experienced flawless Trusted Places functionality more or less since the moment I made this change. For whatever reason, it appears Trusted Places' reliability issue has something to do with locations inputted via a numerical street address -- ya know, the way most people would input them. Once you set a location by physically moving the red pin on the map instead, things seem to go back to normal. I sure as hell can't explain why this feature is broken in that weird-seeming way, but I can tell you it's spectacular to have it working again.

She specifically criticised the big internet firms. “We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed,” she said, adding that Britain and its allies needed to “regulate cyberspace to prevent terrorist and extremist planning”. The threats Mrs May and other political leaders identify online are twofold. The first is the extremist material that spews from jihadist websites and chat-rooms and spreads across social media. The second is terrorists’ ability to communicate via encrypted messaging apps. Together, they create an online echo chamber that amplifies anti-Western messages and helps propel a few individuals on their journey towards murder.

Speakers’ Corner4 hours ago The Economist’s projection: 320 seats for the Conservatives Graphic detail5 hours ago See all updates The three men who stabbed and rammed Londoners in the latest attack were not classic “lone wolves”, radicalised online and invisible to the security services until they acted. They were part of a London-based group that supports Islamic State (IS) and is linked to Al Muhajiroun, a banned Islamist organisation. At least one of them was known to law enforcement. According to the Henry Jackson Society, a British think-tank, a quarter of all those convicted in Britain for offences related to Islamist terrorism between 1998 and 2015 were affiliated to Al Muhajiroun. But evidence is emerging of the role the internet played in reinforcing the three men’s extremism and helping them to plan their attack. One, Khuram Butt, had links to Mohammed Shamsuddin and Abu Haleema, two extremist preachers. The latter has a hefty following on YouTube and is thought to have been partly responsible for the online radicalisation of an Australian teenager convicted last year of plotting to behead a police officer. Abu Haleema was arrested on suspicion of encouraging terrorism, then released on condition that he stopped using social media to spread his views. His Twitter account was closed at the request of MI5, Britain’s security service; YouTube is reported to have refused to take down his videos. Mr Butt was also reportedly influenced by the online videos of Ahmad Musa Jibril, an American preacher and IS recruiter, which YouTube still carries. According to the London-based International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, more than half of a sample group of foreigners who had gone to Syria to fight for IS followed Mr Jibril on Twitter. The London attackers probably also used jihadist websites to help them plan. Instructional videos showing how to kill as many people as possible by driving into them are not hard to find. And judging by past attacks, the perpetrators may well have communicated through an “end-to-end” encrypted messaging app such as WhatsApp or Telegram. Radicalisation superhighway Fears that the internet is promoting and enabling Islamist terrorism are not new. But they have become sharper since 2014, when IS established its “caliphate” in parts of Syria and Iraq. It has put much more effort than its older rival, al-Qaeda, into creating sophisticated online propaganda, which it uses to recruit, promote its ideology and trumpet its social and military achievements. It puts as much attention into digital marketing as any big company, says Andrew Trabulsi of the Institute for the Future, a non-profit research group. “It’s a conversion funnel, in the same way you would think of online advertising.” At first, IS’s aim was to recruit foreign fighters to Syria and Iraq, where they would help build the caliphate. Around 30,000, including some 6,000 from Europe, heeded its call. But as the tides of war have turned (western Mosul, its last big redoubt in Iraq, is about to fall, and Raqqa, its “capital” in Syria, is under assault by the American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces), it is turning its energies to creating mayhem in the West, in particular Europe. Through its various outlets, including Rumiyah, an online English-language magazine, it is asking supporters not to travel to Syria or Iraq, but to kill people at home. IS’s media operation was portrayed in a report published in 2015 for the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think-tank in London. “Documenting the Virtual Caliphate” described an outlet that released nearly 40 items a day, in many languages, ranging from videos of battlefield triumphs and “martyrdom” to documentaries extolling the joys of life in the caliphate. Each wilayat or province of the caliphate has its own media team producing local content. Unlike al-Qaeda, which aims its messages at individual terror cells, IS uses mainstream digital platforms to build social networks and “crowdsource” terrorist acts. Its Twitter supporters play whack-a-mole with moderators, setting up new accounts as fast as old ones are shut down. Some accounts broadcast original content; others promote the new accounts that replace suspended ones; others retweet the most compelling material. When IS releases a new recruitment video, its supporters spring into action. Rita Katz of the SITE Intelligence Group, a Washington-based firm that tracks global terror networks, analysed what happened to “And You Will Be Superior”, a 35-minute video released in March that follows suicide-bombers, from a doctor to a disabled fighter to a child. Translators, promoters, social-media leaders and link-creators joined together to promote it across the internet. One of these groups, the Upload Knights, creates hundreds of links daily across streaming and file-sharing sites. Ms Katz found that in the two days after the film’s release, it distributed the video with 136 unique links to Google services (69 for YouTube, 54 for Google Drive and 13 for Google Photos). Network effects There is no doubt that the way IS uses the internet adds greatly to the fear that terrorists set out to foster. But security experts differ in their assessment of its overall impact. “If there is a message that resonates, it will get out there,” says Nigel Inkster, a former intelligence officer now with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. What the internet has changed, he says, is the speed at which the message travels, and its ubiquity. A counter-terrorism expert at Britain’s Home Office agrees: “The internet has allowed the process of radicalisation to evolve, but it has not revolutionised it.” Although online jihadist content can trigger or reinforce radicalisation, it is rarely enough on its own. Creating a terrorist usually requires grooming through offline social networks that provide the camaraderie of shared purpose and the personal bonds which create feelings of obligation. There is, however, broad agreement that the internet both amplifies the impact of terrorism and launches some disaffected youths on the path to jihad. The violent images they view desensitise them. Propaganda validates their extremist ideology, provides them with the support of a community and primes them to act by emphasising purification through sacrifice. All this puts the big internet firms in a bind. They have no interest in helping users spread extremism, and already ban pro-terrorist content in their terms and conditions. But they have been slow to police fake news and extremist propaganda, lest they be accused of making editorial judgments about what can be shared on their platforms. They have mostly relied on reporting systems, whereby users flag extremist content and companies decide whether to remove it after reviewing it. This is cumbersome, slow and costly. Facebook recently announced that it plans to double its workforce of content moderators, hiring another 3,000. In the 1990s, under pressure from governments, internet firms cleared most child pornography from their platforms. But it is easier to write a program that recognises an image of a child in a sexual act than one that can distinguish extremist content. An algorithm might spot and block images of beheadings, but that would censor some news articles and documentaries. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s boss, has said he wants to invest in artificial intelligence to root out terrorist propaganda, but that it will take many years to develop new tools. In the meantime, the social network and other platforms must rely on human moderators, who have to make difficult judgments. Facebook’s guidelines, which were recently leaked, show how hard it is to distinguish posts that should be removed from those that are offensive but permissible. For example, posting “I’m going to destroy the Facebook Dublin office” is allowed, but posting “I’m going to bomb the Facebook Dublin office” is not, because it is more specific in suggesting a weapon. Some firms are experimenting with new tactics. Jigsaw, a sister company of Google, has tested a “redirect method”, showing ads and videos that counter IS propaganda to people who search for extremist material on Google and YouTube. Microsoft is trying something similar for its search engine, Bing. Last year Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft agreed to work together on a database, where they mark terrorist content with a unique identifier. Other companies can spot tagged content and remove it from their own platforms. But the database is at an early stage and includes only the worst material. Further progress will require joint action by internet firms and governments. Unfortunately, relations have been strained in recent years. The firms used to give some discreet help to authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, says a former British intelligence officer. But they stopped when their co-operation was revealed in the classified material leaked by Edward Snowden in 2013. Some of their customers were horrified to learn that their privacy, however notionally, was being compromised by what they saw as collusion with government spooks. Commercial interests combined with west coast libertarianism to create a dialogue of the deaf. Security services accused firms of ignoring public safety and their legal responsibilities; Apple, Google and others retorted that what they were being asked to do was either impossible or would threaten their profits. After Mrs May’s speech, some felt they were being scapegoated. “Politicians aren’t blaming the car-rental companies for renting white vans, or telecoms firms for offering phone and internet services to bad guys, but they are blaming internet platforms for allowing them to do bad stuff,” grumbles an executive at an American internet firm. Even so, firms are waking up to the fact that if they do not find ways to work with governments, they will be forced to do so. They fear laws along the lines of one recently proposed in Germany that would see them fined vast sums unless they speedily remove any content that has been flagged as hate speech. They also have a growing commercial interest in cracking down on terrorist content, which hurts their brands and could cut revenue. In recent months some of YouTube’s clients pulled their ads after realising that they were appearing next to extremist videos. Quietly, co-operation between governments and internet firms is picking up once more. In Britain a specialist anti-terror police unit that trawls the web for extremist material removed 121,000 pieces of content last year with the help of some 300 companies around the world. Getting around encryption poses greater technical challenges. Weakening it would not be in the public interest, says Robert Hannigan, who ran GCHQ (Britain’s signals-intelligence agency) until January this year. The idea of forcing firms to put “back doors” into their software that authorities could use to spy on terrorists has been largely abandoned. It would make the software less secure for all its users, might violate free-speech protections in America and would anyway be impossible, since some messaging apps, including Telegram (developed by a Russian, Pavel Durov, now a citizen of St Kitts and Nevis) are beyond the reach of Western laws. The authorities do, however, have other options. Once an intelligence agency has access to a target’s phone or laptop, almost anything is possible. These devices’ built-in cameras and microphones make them excellent for bugging. Or the spooks can install covert monitoring software to see what is being displayed on the screen and to log a user’s keystrokes. Since messages must be decrypted before their recipients can read them, this makes it possible to bypass even the strongest encryption. Governments and tech firms now broadly accept that they have a common interest in establishing global standards for exchanging data across borders. A bilateral agreement that Britain and America reached during Barack Obama’s administration is before Congress and awaiting legislation. It would not permit Britain to get data on American citizens or residents; and access would be limited to targeted orders relating to the prevention or investigation of serious crime and terrorism. This could become a template for other international agreements. In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington in May, Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, argued for a change in the legal framework, which he said “impedes America’s allies’ legitimate law-enforcement investigations” and exposes American tech firms to potential conflicts of jurisdiction. Greater legal certainty, less confrontation and more co-operation between governments and firms will not drive jihadist propaganda off the internet altogether. But they should clear the worst material from big sites, help stop some terrorists—and absolve tech firms from the charge of complicity with evil.

It would kind of be like a superpower. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have tools to do it – right now. They are tinkering with artificial intelligence, racks of cloud computing power and ordinary cameras found in every smartphone. And they are anxious to give these tools to developers. It’s going to lead to a new class of corporate superheroes, and the reinvention of business models. We should not be surprised. This is the New Gilded Age. Information technology is growing exponentially. It was just a matter of time before engineers figured out how to use AI to index the physical world. At Google’s recent developer conference, CEO Sundar Pichai unveiled the smartphone app Google Lens. The camera software can easily identify people, places and objects. The sensors inside smartphones give those images context. You just tap the Google Lens icon and point the camera lens at an object. Then the app connects to the full power of Google’s massive knowledge graph. And the object appears on the phone’s screen along with options to get more information. For example, if you aimed at a restaurant, Google Lens can show you the eatery’s hours, menu and reviews. Microsoft is going one step further. Its Custom Vision Search software recognizes images in photographs and video. It adds metadata, uses facial recognition, can transcribe real-time video and even provide translation to supported languages. CVS Health Corp. (CVS) has current partnerships with Samsung, Hewlett Packard and Intel. It’s also being pushed into the Microsoft SDK and API channels supported by 141 million software developers. Now, imagine what they will build. Maintenance workers in the field might gain instant access to repair manuals. The addition of augmented-reality visors would free their hands, boosting productivity and reducing training times. Retailers might enhance the in-store shopping experience by making information about pricing and availability just a snapshot away. The possibilities are endless. The applications will come, soon. Both Microsoft and Alphabet are leading public cloud-computing vendors. All of the corporate world is headed to the public cloud or some combination of public cloud and corporate data center. Gartner, an information technology research firm, argues cloud computing has the potential to be a $1 trillion sector. Companies have already been migrating because it’s more modular, more secure and ultimately more cost-efficient. The rapid ascent of AI will hasten the advance. There is a growing consensus that if your company doesn’t have an AI strategy, it is going to be disrupted by one that does. IDC predicts spending for AI projects will rise to $47 billion by 2020. For reference, it was $8 billion in 2016. And Andrew Ng – the ex-Google, ex-Baidu AI guru – calls AI the new electricity. It’s high praise. It’s also kind of reality. AI allows companies to take data and turn it into actionable intelligence. The way superheroes see nefarious behavior and leap into action. Some people might think the only way to play the trend is Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon (AMZN), the major public-cloud companies. That is simply not true. AI changes business models. The tumult will be felt in every sector. I help my Pivotal Point Trader members find winners, and avoid losers.

Following a seven-year investigation that was triggered by several complaints form Google’s U.S. and European rivals, the company could be slapped with a whopping $7 billion fine. The antitrust investigation against Google began in 2010. This stemmed from accusations that the interest search giant abused its dominant position to skew search engine results to favor its own shopping services. After a five-year investigation, The EU watchdog competition filed a complaint against the company. Google has previously rejected the charges, saying that the regulators ignored competition from other online retailers like eBay Inc. and Amazon. The punishment for antitrust breach can go up to 10 percent of the company’s annual turnover, which is the amount of revenue in a particular period. In Google’s case, that fine can reach up to $7 billion. If found guilty, the search engine giant will also be asked to stop manipulating the online search results in their favor and to cease other alleged anti-competitive practices to even out the playing field for everyone. It’s still not certain, however, what exact measures the company would need to implement to ensure rival companies get equal treatment in online shopping results. Search engine results are important in determining which businesses get customers. Customers go online to look for products and/or services using specific keywords, which when typed on to the search engine, pulls up a list of businesses. The first page of the search engine is crucial because customers are most likely to order from companies that appear here. Additionally, appearing at the top of the list increases the chances of getting customers. According to a report from Reuters, Google previously made attempts to settle the case with former European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia to avoid having to pay a possible fine. All attempts were unsuccessful. The current commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, has expressed an unwillingness to settle with the company. This isn’t the first time Google has been involved in very expensive complaints. In 2016, the commission said that the company broke antitrust rules by abusing its position by imposing restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators. Vestager said that the company denied customers a wider choice of mobile apps and services and that it stands in the way of innovation from the other players in the market. Earlier this year, Google agreed to pay 306 million Euros in back taxes to Italy and Ireland to finally put an end to a series of disputes for the tax years 2002-2006 and 2014-2015. Google also lost an antitrust appeal in Russia over pre-loading Android apps in 2016. According to a report by ZDNet.com, the Federal Antimonopoly Service found Google using its dominance to force its own apps and services on users, which significantly diminished competition. It also paid the U.K. government 130 million British Pounds in back taxes that span 10 years. Another country that seeks to get paid for back taxes worth $1.76 billion is France. The country’s finance minister, Michel Sapin, expressed that they would pursue legal action and that a settlement is off the table. Meanwhile, Google is in hot waters after Germany passed its ancillary-copyright law, which grants publishers the right to content instead of the article author. Aside from the possible multi-million dollar fine, the European Union also instructed Google and other internet giants to put a stop on hate speech. European laws does not allow incitement to violence or hatred directed against people based on descent, religion, race and color, or ethnic origin.

I, for one, am in the hilarious camp. I think I might be in the target audience for this ad. Tim Harman Yea, it's so stupid that it's funny which I think is what they're going for. I mean, Bruno Mars? Qbancelli Dudes getting worked out about some words spoken in a commercial, lol nxtiak I like the current trend of Google commercials. This has the same voice from the Google Photo Scan app commercial. It's funny. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEyDt0DNjWU Rob Agree with you a lot Willie Chalmers III I like the voice, but what she says annoys me. If Google has determined that this style of advertising increases revenue, I'm okay with it. TechGirl90 Really?......It can always be worse, like this commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lwh2xA4uvo Gjorgi Lazarovski WHAT. THE. FUCK. TechGirl90 LOL! My thoughts exactly when I first saw this Commercial. Oliver Cervera ✔ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHA DanSan what the hell did i just watch? serious question. TechGirl90 One of the worst Commercials LG could ever air. Glad they gotten better with their Marketing though, because this is beyond Cringe-Worthy and come across as desperate to try and get attention of Consumers but ends up deterring them even further away with their Marketing Tactics with this Ad.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A Google Algorithm Updates: What You Need to Know About Fred [Infographic] by Laura Forer  |   June 8, 2017  |  1,022 views Tweet Kindle Email Top Google keeps search marketers on their toes with frequent updates to its search algorithms. The latest major update, dubbed "Fred," affected some sites more than others. In this infographic, digital marketing agency 180fusion decodes what that means for marketers. For starters, the infographic explains that the update "mostly targets sites with ad-focused content that prioritize revenue above helping the users." So, sites that use multiple affiliate links, for example, likely registered a downturn in traffic after the update went into effect. It also means that sites that offer valuable content with unobtrusive ads may have had an increase in site traffic, the infographic says. For more details on Fred and who was affected, check out the full infographic. Tap or click to see a larger version.

Amazon executive claims that future versions of the Echo speaker could support rival software David Limp, senior vice president of devices at Amazon, made the comments He said he 'hopes' future versions of the Echo could support other assistants Apple released its HomePod speaker on Monday to taken on Amazon's Echo  If firms got behind the plans it would allow users to mix and match products By Tim Collins For Mailonline Published: 11:52 EDT, 8 June 2017 | Updated: 12:03 EDT, 8 June 2017 e-mail 5 View comments While they might currently be seen as rivals, Amazon and Apple's smart assistants could soon work together, according to a senior executive from Amazon.  He claims that future versions of the Amazon Echo device will support rival software. This could mean that users could choose whether to use Amazon's Alexa assistant on the device, or other assistants, like Siri.    Scroll down for video Amazon's senior vice president of devices at David Limp (pictured) told audiences at the Wired Business Conference held yesterday in New York that future versions of the Echo smart speaker could support rival software like Apple's Siri  INTEGRATED SMART ASSISTANTS  Apple unveiled its new $349 (£270) smart HomePod home speaker at its 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. Amazon and Google's existing speakers have also proved popular with consumers since the Echo launched in the UK in 2016 and Home earlier this year. The speakers, driven by artificial intelligence and voice-enabled assistants have become a leading trend in the tech industry and Alexa now boasts support for more than 10,000 apps. But it would be more convenient for consumers if the systems could be interlinked, allowing users to mix and match smart products. Amazon's senior vice president of devices David Limp told an audience at the Wired Business Conference, held in New York yesterday, that the firm would be open to this. David Limp, senior vice president of devices at Amazon, made the comments at the Wired Business Conference, held in New York yesterday. 'You should be able to tell Alexa, "ask Siri X,"' he said. 'If Apple or Google want to come calling, my phone number is out there, they can call. 'I don't know if I can envision it but I hope that will happen on behalf of customers.'  The remarks may come as a shock after Apple unveiled its new $349 (£270) smart HomePod home speaker at its 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference only days ago. Amazon's existing speakers have also already been popular with consumers since the Echo launched in the UK in 2016.

Share this article Share 'I think when people are starting to spend that amount of money for a speaker, call it hundreds of dollars per speaker, I think that generally they are going to want choice,' Mr Limp added. 'And we sell a lot of speakers on Amazon and we want to give people a lot of choice.' Apple's HomePod is designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service and can produce rich sound while tapping into the artificial intelligence power of Siri. Amazon's existing speakers have also proved popular with consumers since the Echo (pictured) launched in the UK in 2016 The new $349 (£270) smart 'HomePod' home speaker (pictured) will go on sale later this year, and use Siri to play music and answer questions (stock image) The firm has also overhauled its smart assistant's voice with a new AI version for both male and female versions, along with a new app that can show users on screen information. Siri can also now translate into different languages and it uses a new system to learn about its owner using 'on device' AI to learns about a person's likes and dislikes. The device uses a technique known as beam forming to personalise the sound for each room and listener. Two can also be linked together to form stereo speakers. It has six microphones, and is activated with the phrase Hey Siri. It can do everything from giving news, weather and sports to setting timers and texting people.  The speaker is expected to go on sale later this year. THE SMART SPEAKER WARS  The HomePod takes on Amazon's Echo and Google Home. It will have a higher price tag than the Amazon Echo range, which begins at $49 (£49) for the Echo Dot. The speaker will provide a hub for appliances via Apple's HomeKit system and establish a centre inside the home to lock people in to using other Apple services, according to the report. The HomePod will take on Amazon's Echo (left) and Google Home (right). Google's $130 (£105) Home speaker is triggered by the phrase 'Hey Google' while Amazon's Echo uses 'Alexa'. Amazon's smart speaker is available in two versions - the full sized $180 (£145) Echo shown here, and a smaller, $50 (£40) version called the Echo Dot. A speaker might help customers stay loyal to other services such as Apple Music, Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods.  Google's $130 (£105) Home speaker is triggered by the phrase 'Hey Google' while Amazon's Echo uses 'Alexa'. Amazon's smart speaker is available in two versions - the full sized $180 (£145) Echo shown here, and a smaller, $50 (£40) version called the Echo Dot. Amazon Echo uses Microsoft's Bing search engine to provide additional information, while Google Home uses the company's own Google Search. Both Home and Echo are continually listening for commands, though Google and Amazon say nothing gets passed back to them until the speakers hear a keyword — 'OK, Google' for Home and 'Alexa' for Echo. Google's Assistant software is also able to answer follow-up questions on the same topic, in a near-conversation style, but Echo as yet cannot. However, Amazon's Alexa software has a wider range of skills on offer that enable it to link up with and control more third-party devices around the home. A light comes on to remind you that it's listening. You can turn off the microphone temporarily, too.  Read more: Apple Events - WWDC Keynote, June 2017 - Apple Steve T-S on Twitter: "Ahead of iOS 11, a 'Files' app placeholder entry from Apple appears on the App Store.

By Simon Bradley Business in depth: International Geneva ... Print comment Reuse article Share: share on twitter share on facebook send by e-mail more... Jun 8, 2017 - 16:09 The robot Sophia, which integrates the latest technologies and artificial intelligence, was showcased at the AI for Good Global Summit in Geneva from June 7-9, 2017 (ITU) Beyond self-driving cars and Google Translate software, there is much talk about how artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can be used to transform society for the better. A conference in Geneva this week is examining the pros and cons of AI, and the way forward.  Some 500 policymakers, academics and executives are gathered in Geneva this week for the inaugural “AI for Good Global Summitexternal link”, co-organized by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the Xprize Foundationexternal link, a Silicon Valley non-profit group.  The conference has a grand title and a lofty aim – “to chart a course for AI that will benefit all of humanity”. The UN, which is represented by 20 agencies such as the children’s fund UNICEF, wants to refocus AI on sustainable developmentexternal link and see how it can contribute to global efforts to eliminate poverty and hunger, and to protect the environment.  “Artificial Intelligence has the potential to accelerate towards a dignified life, in peace and prosperity, for all people,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres told event attendees in a video address. “The time has arrived for all of us – governments, industry and civil society – to consider how AI will affect our future.”  AI has been steadily grabbing the headlines. Last month, a Google AI programme defeated a Chinese grand master at the ancient board game Go. Unbeknownst to many people, forms of AI are already transforming daily lives.  “It’s all around us. It’s not the future but is already happening,” declared Jürgen Schmidhuberexternal link, scientific director of the Swiss AI laboratory, whose researchers have developed software for companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. “All of us have AI in our pockets when we use our smartphones to do speech recognition.”  Yoshua Bengioexternal link, a computer scientist from the University of Montreal, acknowledged that much progress had been made in the areas of speech recognition, and the ability of computers to recognize objects and use and understand human language.  “More researchers are studying this area, so we are making rapid progress,” he declared. “Right now there is low-hanging fruit like using Al for medical image classification, or detecting cancer cells from video.” Smart robot Sophia Sophia, a robot integrating the latest technologies and artificial intelligence developed by Hanson Robotics, was showcased at the "AI for Good ... Sci & Tech Facebookexternal link, for example, is mapping the world’s population by using image-recognition software to read satellite images for signs of human habitation. IBM is using AI techniques to predict pollution levelsexternal link and scientists at Stanford Universityexternal link are employing AI and satellite remote-sensing data to predict crop yields months ahead of harvest.   David Salomão, a software engineer who works at The National Communications Institute of Mozambique (INCM), has a similar idea.  “We're trying to combine mobile telecommunications with artificial intelligence to support agriculture,” he explained. “The idea is to support farmers with automated irrigation systems that decide when to turn off or on and that can assess the moisture of the soil.”  In her conference speech in Geneva, former World Health Organization chief Margaret Chan described AI as the “new frontier” for the health sector.  “Health information is often messy and poorly structured,” she said. “It’s not systematically analysed. AI can give data structure, speed up the reading of results from electrocardiograms and give more precise predictions. This can cut down on healthcare costs.”  Chan said that AI has massive potential but urged caution.  “Medical decisions are complex, and rely on care and compassion. I doubt that a machine will ever be able to imitate genuine human compassion.”  She pointed out that developing countries have little use for a smart system to diagnose illness if there are no doctors and nurses, clean running water and electricity or medicines.  Best or worst thing ever  The future of AI  A new surveyexternal link of machine learning forecasts that AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next decade, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school level essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and working as a surgeon (by 2053). Researchers believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years, with Asian respondents expecting to reach these dates much sooner than North Americans. Last year, Professor Stephen Hawking warned that the creation of powerful AI would be “either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity”.  Ensuring that AI is used to redistribute wealth and reduce inequalities between states is just one of many huge challenges for policymakers considering how to govern AI at the global level while technological development accelerates.  “Discussion on AI is at the fork in the road,” Salil Shettyexternal link, secretary general of Amnesty International, told the audience.  He described AI’s potential for “huge economic disruption” leading to hundreds of millions of jobs lost to automation. He also warned of the risks for democracy and elections as seen in recent reports of the impact of AI and big data on the US elections and Brexit.  “In the future, robot cops will patrol our streets and wars will be fought by killer robots,” Shetty said. “Will AI systems become the gatekeepers deciding who can access healthcare and who qualifies for a job or mortgages?

How can artificial intelligence be leveraged for the greater good?
Simon Bradley
Jun 8, 2017 - 16:09

Beyond self-driving cars and Google Translate software, there is much talk about how artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can be used to transform society for the better. A conference in Geneva this week is examining the pros and cons of AI, and the way forward. 

Some 500 policymakers, academics and executives are gathered in Geneva this week for the inaugural “AI for Good Global Summit”, co-organized by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the Xprize Foundation, a Silicon Valley non-profit group. 

The conference has a grand title and a lofty aim – “to chart a course for AI that will benefit all of humanity”. The UN, which is represented by 20 agencies such as the children’s fund UNICEF, wants to refocus AI on sustainable development and see how it can contribute to global efforts to eliminate poverty and hunger, and to protect the environment. 

“Artificial Intelligence has the potential to accelerate towards a dignified life, in peace and prosperity, for all people,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres told event attendees in a video address. “The time has arrived for all of us – governments, industry and civil society – to consider how AI will affect our future.” 

AI has been steadily grabbing the headlines. Last month, a Google AI programme defeated a Chinese grand master at the ancient board game Go. Unbeknownst to many people, forms of AI are already transforming daily lives. 

“It’s all around us. It’s not the future but is already happening,” declared Jürgen Schmidhuber, scientific director of the Swiss AI laboratory, whose researchers have developed software for companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. “All of us have AI in our pockets when we use our smartphones to do speech recognition.” 

Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist from the University of Montreal, acknowledged that much progress had been made in the areas of speech recognition, and the ability of computers to recognize objects and use and understand human language. 

“More researchers are studying this area, so we are making rapid progress,” he declared. “Right now there is low-hanging fruit like using Al for medical image classification, or detecting cancer cells from video.”


Facebook, for example, is mapping the world’s population by using image-recognition software to read satellite images for signs of human habitation. IBM is using AI techniques to predict pollution levels and scientists at Stanford University are employing AI and satellite remote-sensing data to predict crop yields months ahead of harvest.  

David Salomão, a software engineer who works at The National Communications Institute of Mozambique (INCM), has a similar idea. 

“We're trying to combine mobile telecommunications with artificial intelligence to support agriculture,” he explained. “The idea is to support farmers with automated irrigation systems that decide when to turn off or on and that can assess the moisture of the soil.” 

In her conference speech in Geneva, former World Health Organization chief Margaret Chan described AI as the “new frontier” for the health sector. 

“Health information is often messy and poorly structured,” she said. “It’s not systematically analysed. AI can give data structure, speed up the reading of results from electrocardiograms and give more precise predictions. This can cut down on healthcare costs.” 

Chan said that AI has massive potential but urged caution. 

“Medical decisions are complex, and rely on care and compassion. I doubt that a machine will ever be able to imitate genuine human compassion.” 

She pointed out that developing countries have little use for a smart system to diagnose illness if there are no doctors and nurses, clean running water and electricity or medicines. 

Best or worst thing ever 

The future of AI 

A new survey of machine learning forecasts that AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next decade, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school level essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and working as a surgeon (by 2053). Researchers believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years, with Asian respondents expecting to reach these dates much sooner than North Americans.

Last year, Professor Stephen Hawking warned that the creation of powerful AI would be “either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity”. 

Ensuring that AI is used to redistribute wealth and reduce inequalities between states is just one of many huge challenges for policymakers considering how to govern AI at the global level while technological development accelerates. 

“Discussion on AI is at the fork in the road,” Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, told the audience. 

He described AI’s potential for “huge economic disruption” leading to hundreds of millions of jobs lost to automation. He also warned of the risks for democracy and elections as seen in recent reports of the impact of AI and big data on the US elections and Brexit. 

“In the future, robot cops will patrol our streets and wars will be fought by killer robots,” Shetty said. “Will AI systems become the gatekeepers deciding who can access healthcare and who qualifies for a job or mortgages? Those in power who have access to the fruits of the data economy, a handful of countries and companies, will be those who continue to gain while the vast majority of people will be left behind…we can do better.” 

More initiatives

On Wednesday, Shetty announced that Amnesty International had launched an “AI and Human Rights Initiative” to “enshrine the protection of human rights in the use and development of AI”. It joins a host of other global AI initiatives, such as the Partnership on AI, which includes Google, Microsoft and Human Rights Watch, or OpenAI, a non-profit research company launched in 2015 by philanthropists and entrepreneurs to develop “safe” AI systems. 

The UN is throwing its hat into the ring as well; ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao told the conference that Secretary General Guterres had proposed to start a special advisory committee for AI. The ITU plans to hold informal consultations to see how the UN can work together with industry and academics to promote AI innovation and create a good environment for its development. 

All sides seem to agree that there is a pressing need for a clear roadmap, but some observers warn about giving too much power to the private sector. 

“The primary danger of the AI for Good Global Summit is not that it distorts perceptions of AI risk; it is that Silicon Valley will wield greater influence over AI governance with each successive summit,” researcher Kyle Evanoff wrote on a blog on the Council of Foreign Relations website.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Apple The inside story of how Apple’s Siri lost its lead over rivals Chris Smith @chris_writes June 8th, 2017 at 10:23 AM Share Tweet Siri may have been the first virtual assistant, but Apple failed to turn it into a leader. Google came out with Google Now and then Google Assistant, and Microsoft followed suit with Cortana. But Amazon dropped in, seemingly out of nowhere, with a voice-based virtual assistant that won the early fight of the voice assistant war. A new report revealed what went on at Apple since it first introduced Siri, and why Apple is now playing catch-up in this particular business. Don't Miss: New leak claims to reveal final iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s Plus designs Speaking to former Apple employees and developers The Wall Street Journal learned a part of Siri’s inside story. Apple certainly has a great foothold in the virtual assistant business thanks to the millions of iPhones and iPads out in the wild. But multiple factors, including internal reshuffles and talent departures, an apparent lack of vision clarity, but also the success of the iPhone and the increased focus on user privacy are factors that “helped” Apple fall behind with Siri. Sure, Apple has just given Siri new powers and a brand new HomePod, but it’ll be a while until it beats Amazon. “People at Apple’s anxiety level went up a notch” as they watched Amazon demoing Alexa’s capabilities, a former member of Apple’s Siri team told The Journal. All of a sudden, a voice-controlled device for the home was able to do more things and understand voice better than Siri. “A lack of urgency and difficulty bringing ideas to fruition,” kept Siri development back, The Journal says, after talking to former executives, close observers, and Apple users. One of the anecdotes the report details concerns the hiring of Bill Stasior, a former Amazon search executive who arrived at Apple to oversee Siri about a year of Steve Jobs’s death, the man who brought Siri to Apple. But Stasior’s focus was on search, not speech or language which made some members of the Siri team think that he didn’t “fully appreciate the product’s original vision.” Siri cofounders Adam Cheyer and Dag Kittlaus left the team and formed Viv Labs which was acquired by Samsung not too long ago. Half a dozen other members of the team followed. Apple’s insistence on protecting user data is also what hinders Siri development, the report says, as Apple gives up control of user data too fast to gauge the impact of new Siri features. “You’re hamstrung,” former Siri engineer Jason Douglas said. “The iTunes store has great data, but the scale of it is not Google or Amazon.” Finally, Apple’s reluctance to share Siri access is also one reason why the assistant failed to evolve at the same pace of Amazon’s Alexa. The Journal’s full report on the matter is available at this link, and it’s definitely worth a read.

It imagines an empire which surveys itself in such exhaustive detail that when unfolded, the perfectly complete 1:1 paper map covers the entire kingdom. Because it is unwieldy and thus largely useless, subsequent generations allow it to decay into tatters. Great scraps are left carpeting the deserts. In their capacity for up-to-the-minute detail, modern maps surpass even Borges’s creation. By using networks of sensors, computing power and data-crunching expertise, digital cartographers can produce what are in effect real-time simulations of the physical world, on which both humans and machines can base decisions. These maps show where roadworks are blocking traffic or which street corners are the most polluted. Innovative products will make new demands of them. Drones need to know how to fly through cities; an augmented-reality game might need to know the exact position in London of Nelson’s column.

Speakers’ Corner4 hours ago The Economist’s projection: 320 seats for the Conservatives Graphic detail4 hours ago See all updates Google is the giant of the consumer-mapping world. More than 1bn people use the Google Maps smartphone app every month. Rivals can still prosper by providing detailed directions in dense cities: CityMapper, for example, tells its users which exit to take in London’s warren-like tube stations. But none can match Google’s revenues. Local search ads allow firms to place adverts inside the search results of a person who is physically near their premises, along with maps showing their locations. And promoted pins permit businesses to highlight their own positions along routes that Google calculates for navigation—a pin for a Starbucks en route to Central Park in New York, say. Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, projects that such ads will generate $1.4bn of revenue for Google in 2017, rising to $3.3bn by 2020. Yet the race to develop autonomous cars, which cannot run without guidance from machine-readable maps known as “splines” or “digital rails”, could be a far bigger opportunity. Goldman Sachs, another investment bank, reckons that the market for maps for autonomous cars will grow in value from around $2.2bn in 2020 to $24.5bn by 2050 (see chart). Google’s dominance in consumer mapping means it has a strong advantage in this emerging field (which will mainly accrue to Waymo, its autonomous-car spin-off). But it will not have things all its own way. An assortment of other Silicon Valley giants, startups, carmakers and a few old-fashioned mapping firms, are fighting hard. The inputs for digital mapping are threefold. First comes information about roads, buildings and so on. Such base maps have been commoditised. A British open-data repository called OpenStreetMap (and its cousin organisation, OpenAddresses), that is already widely used and has global data, provides the basics. Many new mapping businesses build on top of OSM data. Imagery containing close-up detail of streets is the second main ingredient. In May Google said it had used an artificial-intelligence technique known as deep learning to scan 80bn photos, automatically identifying house numbers and the names of streets and businesses. Its photos were gathered from its “StreetView” cars, which have trawled the planet capturing street imagery since 2007, at a vast cost. This archive is a barrier to entry for other companies, but it may be tumbling. Mapillary, a Swedish startup which also uses deep learning to process imagery, has released a data-set of 25,000 street photos collected through its own sensor network. Its chief executive, Jan Erik Solem, says that Mapillary’s fastest-growing business is providing data mined from those images to companies that are trying to build maps for autonomous cars. (Laser scanners and radar used by autonomous cars to navigate will add to the torrents of data.) Large quantities of real-time GPS location data from people with smartphones in their pockets are the third important input. Google harvests such data from Google Map users as they move around the world. If it stops seeing data streaming off a street, for example, it is likely to mean that the road has been closed. Here, too, Google’s defences are looking less impassable. Mapbox, a young firm based in San Francisco, has found another clever way to compete—a map-specific software-development kit (SDK) which any developer can install and use to present maps to users. When those users call up one of its maps, Mapbox receives anonymised location data. Mapbox’s SDK is now in some 250m phones. Marc Prioleau, a mapping guru whom Mapbox poached from Uber, a ride-hailing firm, says the firm is gathering enough data in the Bay Area alone to redraw every road there ten times a day. Google is also vying with a legacy mapping firm that has sold map data for car-navigation systems since 1985. Germany’s three largest car companies, Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW, bought HERE, based in Chicago, for €2.8bn ($3.1bn) in 2015. In December a Chinese and Singaporean consortium including Tencent, an internet giant, and NavInfo, a mapping firm based in Beijing, took a 10% stake in it. HERE will provide Tencent with digital maps of China. It will get access to location data from WeChat, Tencent’s popular chat app, connecting it to a sensor network the scale of which rivals Google’s. The firm has also joined forces with Shenzhen-based DJI, the world’s biggest drone-maker. America’s big three car companies, General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, have also invested heavily in digital mapping through AI startups and in partnerships with ride-hailing firms and with TomTom of the Netherlands, another older mapping firm. Google is hard to avoid, though: Fiat Chrysler has joined Waymo’s self-driving programme in Phoenix, Arizona and will use the search giant’s mapping data. And whoever ends up winning most sway over cartography, Borges’s everything map is no longer imaginary.

According to David Ruddock, managing editor at Android Police, users of the Google Pixel will be able to download the upcoming version of Android in the first two weeks of August 2017. Related: Google Pixel review Ruddock took to Twitter to deliver the news: He makes it clear that this information comes from a source he deems reliable, but admits that release dates are always likely to change. If this rumour is true then Pixel owners will receive an updated version of Android earlier than the Nexus line of phones did with Nougat last year. This rumour doesn't specify whether older Google phones will receive the Android O update at the same time as the Pixel. One of the most appealing features of any Google phone is the certainty that the handset will always receive an update for the latest version of Android. This doesn't seem to be changing with the Pixel. The earlier release date of Android O for the Pixel may mean third-party Android manufacturers such as Samsung and LG will similarly get the latest version of Google's OS running on their devices sooner than expected.

Lily Hay Newman Security Date of Publication: 05.31.17. 05.31.17 Time of Publication: 3:23 pm. 3:23 pm Inside Google’s Global Campaign to Shut Down Phishing Getty Images At the beginning of May, a phishing scam flooded the web, disguised as a typical Google Docs request. Some of the emails even appeared to come from acquaintances. If victims clicked through and granted seemingly innocuous permissions, they exposed their entire Gmail account to whoever was behind the scam. It was an explosive scheme. And Google responded in kind. “We convened what we call a war room,” says Mark Risher, Google’s director of counter-abuse technology. “Basically we pulled people together in a physical room here in Mountain View, California, and we also had experts from many other offices around the company that quickly came together. Each specialty gets called in.” More Google Security Lily Hay Newman Don’t Open That Google Doc Unless You’re Positive It’s Legit Lily Hay Newman Phishing Scams Even Fool Tech Nerds—Here’s How to Avoid Them Andy Greenberg Google’s Chrome Hackers Are About to Upend Your Idea of Web Security Unfortunately, that sort of crisis response is all too common for Google. Its massive user base and footprint on the web make its services and customers prominent targets for every imaginable phishing attack, not to mention all the other manner of hacks and assaults. But phishing presents an especially tricky problem. Campaigns are hard to spot by design, and also evolve rapidly. “The bad guys try hard, so we are motivated to try even harder,” says Sri Somanchi, a project manager in the Gmail anti-abuse team. “We keep going because we know that any little slip up on our side is going to have a huge cost for users.” That response can take many forms. And if they’re doing their job right, you barely even notice. Phish Fry When the Google Docs phish spiked—affecting 0.1 percent of Gmail users, or about 1 million accounts—Google anti-abuse teams started by sharing information, and hammering out shifts across Google offices around the world to ensure 24-hour coverage. “There’s a team that’s working specifically on Gmail inbounds, they’re trying to make sure that the email messages are not getting spread,” Risher says. “There’s another team that’s working on account abuse patterns, and they’re trying to look at who is using the credentials that have been accessed. There’s a third team that’s looking at the spread of this message.” Within a few hours, Google had stopped the phishing attempt from spreading further. Within a day, Google rolled out expanded anti-phishing security warnings for Gmail on Android. That joins a handful of other anti-phishing and threat-warning tools that Google has debuted over the last several years, like the Chrome extension Password Alert, which cautions you if it thinks you just entered your Google username and password into an imposter login page. The company also announced new phishing protections targeted at business users on Wednesday, including warnings when enterprise users attempt to send data outside their company, and additional ransomware protections. Google works to make it as easy as possible for users to make safe choices and avoid scams, but the company’s focus is on tech solutions that are meant to work seamlessly with minimal user buy-in. Some phishing specialists believe that emphasizing user training is the real key to stopping phishing, but as Aaron Higbee, the CTO of the user-training firm PhishMe, puts it, “We need technology to do as much as it can. For Google they have to pursue that.” Focusing on technological solutions plays to Google’s strengths. One example is Google’s Safe Browsing infrastructure, which displays warning messages across Chrome, Android, Search, and Gmail if you try to access a potentially malicious site or download. Google also makes Safe Browsing available to third-party developers—browsers like Mozilla’s Firefox and Apple’s Safari incorporate it. And Google uses Safe Browsing in its Ads service to catch ads that attempt to promote malicious content. In all, the company says that Safe Browsing benefits two billion devices per day. Safe Browsing warnings give a boost to internet users who may feel overwhelmed by the daily barrage of digital threats. But for Google, the service reflects a long-term investment that originated over a decade ago. As Google crawls the internet for its flagship search engine, it uses that data to flag malicious pages that host social engineering attacks, malware, phishing campaigns, and more. “For a lot of users their main interaction with Safe Browsing is a big red warning page,” says Allison Miller, who leads the Safe Browsing team and also works with Google’s Threat Analysis Group. That belies how much work happens behind the scenes to generate those warnings in the first place—and the huge scale of the challenge. “We have to guard every door, every window, every opening, and the bad guys just need to get through one,” Risher says. “It can be tough when most of your moments of fame and glory are something bad happened and you were able to stop it before it got too bad.” First Line of Defense Hundreds of Google employees work on security and anti-abuse at every level. Their approach hinges on numerous layers of protection, a strategy known as defense in depth. The first layer of defense between phishers and your Gmail account is an automated bulk filtering process, which draws on Safe Browsing and other black-listing tools that blocks a huge amount of junk. Actually, huge might not cover it. Google blocks as much as 90 percent of the email volume sent to Gmail before it ever reaches users. And no, that doesn’t include what lands in your spam folder. “A lot of this is achieved through maintaining the reputation of every sender of the world,” Somanchi says. “As we keep receiving emails we compute reputation on thousands of email attributes, and then we use these reputations to pre-determine if a sender is legitimate or shady.” Google also scans for bad links, meaning if you accidentally sent a known phishing link to a friend from Gmail, it won’t deliver it no matter how sterling your email rep. It gets even more granular from there. Google subjects messages that make the first cut to even more intense filtering, during which Gmail looks for impersonations and forgeries as it decides whether to plop a message into your spam folder or inbox. In cases of uncertainty, it’ll let the message through, but add a banner warning that it may have been sent from a compromised account. Similarly, if Gmail doesn’t have enough information to make a final determination about an email, it may deliver it but with protections in place, like adding warnings and disabling the email’s links or attachments. Rather than rely on one or two cure-alls, Gmail provides layers. “Even if the bad guys have collected your password they still should not be able to use it, and even if they are able to use it what they do in the account is part of our continuous risk-based authentication,” Risher says. “It’s very cumulative.” The Gray Area Googlers say that the biggest challenge in phishing defense and anti-abuse in general is handling content that may or may not be malicious. “You have to moderate your response to ensure that you’re not blocking everyone who is in this gray area,” Risher says. “It’s really important to understand the badness that’s taking place, but also to moderate that against the good activity—the regular, legitimate activity—and not go to the other extreme and end up harming the broad [Google] ecosystem.” One form of proactive defense? Notifying webmasters and email senders when they haven’t taken steps to secure and authenticate their sites and activity, or when something happens on their site that they may not know about. “It’s a rising trend for bad actors to not just create their own websites for the sole purpose of hosting malware and phishing, but to compromise others, and then leverage that hacked site to host their own content” says Safe Browsing’s Miller. Doing so lets bad actors leverage another party’s solid reputation. Google’s feedback can make webmasters and email senders aware that they’ve been compromised and that they’re unintentionally engaging in abusive behavior. ‘We have to guard every door, every window, every opening, and the bad guys just need to get through one.’ Mark Risher, Google It also wouldn’t be a Google effort without a little machine learning thrown in. Somanchi says that upwards of 95 percent of all spam and phishing identification comes from machine learning. And in the past couple of years, these Gmail mechanisms have evolved to incorporate both traditional supervised learning, in which algorithms are trained on large data sets, with newer unsupervised learning techniques, in which algorithms learn through inference about how to tell legitimate inputs from malicious ones. “Whereas regular computers are making very hard black or white decisions, deep learning opens up the possibility to be more subjective and get closer to approximating, essentially, would humans fall for this?” Risher says. Google also emphasizes that deploying machine learning also helps preserve user privacy. All that data scanning and user behavior modeling can feel plenty invasive. But Miller says that the goal is to limit access to sensitive information, keeping it siloed and therefore less vulnerable. “The systems operate on aggregated data, and the work is done without any human visibility into potentially private information,” Miller says. “We focus our attention on clustering and identifying attackers and their methods. Systems like Safe Browsing and our anti-phishing defenses identify commonalities in attack patterns.” Scams like the Google Docs phish still slip past Google’s protections. But what the anti-abuse teams learn from these types of attacks helps them prepare for next time. “When something goes wrong we really are not focused on who screwed up,” he says. “We’re looking at what changes we ought to make so this can’t happen again.” Related Video Science Phishing Scams Aren’t Just for Gullible Grandparents Anymore Phishing scams are getting more and more sophisticated, to the point where they’re fooling even security experts.

Its logo is synonymous with the plastic forms of payment for which the company is still best known. The ability to pay for things with a debit card or your smartphone instead of having to carry around cash (or something to barter) is sort of miraculous. For nearly the whole of human history, and in many parts of the world still, economies have been built on the premise of physical mediums of exchange. If Visa’s innovation chief Jim McCarthy has his way, Visa itself may soon become invisible. “The magic of Uber and Amazon, they made payment kind of disappear,” McCarthy said at the 2017 Wired Business Conference in New York today. (Visa is the conference’s main corporate sponsor.) Naturally, McCarthy wants Visa to stay at the center of the payments ecosystem, even as the consumer-side of paying for stuff becomes less visible. And to do that, he says, Visa has focused on making it easier for tech companies like Apple and Samsung to tap into Visa’s services. As an example, when you use something like Apple Pay or Samsung Pay, the software actually creates a unique card number for each of your devices. So if you have an iPhone, a Samsung Gear watch, and a debit card, each one of those has a unique card number tied back to your bank account. If one of your accounts is compromised, new numbers can be created for the devices in the background without you ever having to know about it Eventually, that that could mean the end of having to manually change your credit card number with every different service every time you get a new card. To make all that work, the payment apps actually have to communicate with Visa’s servers to generate and process card numbers. It’s not hard to imagine more radical scenarios, like the ability to simply walk into a store, take what you want, and leave without having to worry about the entire payment process. When that finally happens, Visa wants to be there, making all the hard parts of sending and receiving money around the world look easy. Go Back to Top.

Then again, on a show about a theme park staffed with sentient robots—sorry, “hosts”—those outcomes are exactly what audiences have come to expect. If science fiction has taught folks anything, it’s that the machines will always rise up against humankind. But why does sci-fi always veer dystopian? Westworld’s creators have a theory. Storytelling, according to show co-creator Jonathan Nolan, serves an evolutionary purpose, allowing us to try out different realities. With sci-fi, because it’s so often forward-looking, “we’re inventing cautionary tales for ourselves,” Nolan said today at WIRED’s 2017 Business Conference in New York. In other words, when your creations would hurt a fly, it’s time to start worrying. ‘It's not going to be a beautiful lady or a beautiful man who is going to come and be your overlord.’ So does that mean Nolan and his co-creator (and wife) Lisa Joy think Westworld is a foreseeable future? Not entirely. For Nolan, the robots on his show represent more of an allegory for human behavior than a cautionary tale. And Joy sees Westworld, and sci-fi in general, as an opportunity to talk about what humanity could or should do if things start to go wrong, especially now that advancements in artificial intelligence technologies are making things like androids seem far more plausible than before. “We’re leaping into the age of the unfathomable, the time when machines [can do things we can’t],” Joy said. Even though their show loosely taps into the dystopian trope of the AI uprising, Westworld’s co-creators don’t think the actual AI being developed right now will lead to total apocalypse. Instead, Joy said, little bits of AI—like Amazon predicting your purchasing needs or cars helping you drive home—will take over people’s lives piecemeal. Right now, however, “these technologies don’t have a moral compass yet,” Nolan said, adding that thanks to the algorithms telling people what news they might want to read and what opinions they might want to hear, “we’re in a time of artificial ignorance.” If and when true androids do arrive, though, don’t expect them to look like the passing-for-human hosts of Westworld, though. “We anthropomorphized what the AI will look like,” Joy says. “That’s not going to happen. It’s not going to be a beautiful lady or a beautiful man who is going to come and be your overlord.” Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. TV Wired Business Conference 2017 Skip Social.

Ask Norman Foster what if anything he’d like to change about Apple’s recently constructed headquarters in Cupertino, California, and he’ll need a moment to think. The famed architect, whose firm spent the last eight years perfecting plans for Apple’s glassy Campus 2, is mostly pleased with the results. But there is one thing: “The only hesitation I have is in terms of the changing patterns of transportation,” Foster said today at the WIRED Business Conference. Apple’s headquarters feature a massive underground garage built to hold 11,000 vehicles. Today, that’s an amenity. But not too far in the future, it’s entirely possible that cars (and garages) will be far less important. “Maybe the conventional garage needs to be rethought and rethought now,” Foster continued. “Maybe if I had a second time around I’d be putting a lot of persuasive pressure to say, ‘Make the floor-to-floor of a car park that much bigger, so if you’re not going to be filling it with cars in the future you could more easily retrofit it for more habitable space.” For Foster, the future of workplace design is dependent on this kind of flexibility. It might sound counterintuitive given Steve Jobs’ unrelenting attention to detail. Foster recalls when Jobs first approached him in 2009 to talk about building a new campus. “He had a very clear vision in terms of what the project was,” Foster said on stage. Jobs wanted the building to lie low to the ground to blend into the surrounding landscape. The late Apple CEO dictated everything from door handles to materials to the ultra-tight tolerances required throughout the building. Jobs was obsessed with glass and wanted to encourage the connection between indoors and outdoors, going as far as to build a door in the campus’ restaurant that could completely open in 12 seconds, eliminating the barrier to the outside world. It’s easy to assume a strict adherence to vision would stifle flexibility. “The reverse is actually true,” Foster said. The best buildings, he contends, require a strong point of view. They must be thoughtfully designed to adapt to the ways humans and society will inevitably change, and that requires more than just building open-plan layouts. Ultimately, the most enduring workplaces will take into account the deep-rooted desires of the people who spend time there. They’ll prioritize smart paths of circulation to help people connect with one another. Instead of sequestering employees into glass boxes, they’ll encourage them to connect with nature. To be truly competitive, architects and companies have to think beyond productivity. “From the very beginning, I’ve protested the idea that an office headquarters, whether it’s mega or micro, is only about work,” Foster said. “It’s about lifestyle.” Go Back to Top.

Cole Wilson for WIRED Andy Rubin is an excellent sharer. The longtime inventor, founder of Android, and current CEO of two companies—tech incubator Playground and gadget maker Essential—believes strongly that the best way to invent the future is to do it together. That’s why he encourages the companies he funds and advises at Playground to share technology, he said today at WIRED’s 2017 Business Conference in New York. “A lot of those building blocks are pretty repetitive,” Rubin said. “So a lot of the work this team does is repeatable.” For the same reason, Rubin’s already sharing details of how Essential plans to organize and orchestrate the smart home, and then help others do the same. Essential only launched publicly at the end of May, introducing two products: a phone and a smart-home hub. The phone, Rubin told the Business Conference crowd, is a necessary first step for the company. “Your phone is your main screen,” he said. “You probably sleep with your phone two feet away from you on your nightstand.” (Guilty.) The screen in your pocket is your primary point of access for all the communication, work, and time-wasting you do in a day. Rubin wanted to make a great phone, earn space in your pocket, and then start to build new tech atop that platform. The long-term vision for Essential, Rubin said, is more closely aligned with the Essential Home, which Rubin hopes you’ll put in your kitchen or living room and use to control all the connected devices where you live. Just don’t call it a smart speaker, or compare it to an Amazon Echo. “It’s beginning to explore the relationships of the mixed-mode interface,” Rubin said. “You have a touchscreen and an LCD combined with speech, combined with the other sensors you have in your home like cameras and doorbells and locks.” The Home’s job is to take your August Smart Lock, your Nest thermostat, your Philips Hue lights, and that Samsung fridge you bought with a huge touchscreen, and make them all work together. Right now, they don’t; they’re all built on different ecosystems and platforms that refuse to talk together. “Everybody’s building islands,” Rubin said. “And they’re expecting people to plug into them. When really what has to happen is—and this happened with Android—these islands need bridges.” Rubin admitted this is hard work, and a long road. But he’s even starting to think about Essential’s next product. There’s Home, Phone—and maybe soon, Car. Rubin specifically mentioned the potential power of a really smart dashcam anyone can put in their car. Before he gets there, Rubin has a phone and a smart-home hub to ship. And a whole lot of bridges to build. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Andy Rubin smart home smartphones Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Cole Wilson for WIRED Jennifer Doudna was sitting in her UC Berkeley office when she got the first call from a reporter asking what she thought about scientists using Crispr to modify embryos. At the time, the embryos in question were monkeys. It was late 2014, and Doudna was just beginning to become the face of Crispr/Cas9—the bacterial enzyme behind today’s gene editing revolution. Since then she has fielded an ongoing avalanche of questions about the implications of her discovery. How it’s going to change the future of everything from medicine to agriculture to energy production. But inevitably the questions always get around to super-babies. Today, at WIRED’s 2017 Business Conference in New York, it took just a few minutes. Doudna said it was exactly this possibility—Crispr custom-designed human offspring—that made her take a step back from her own research and get involved in public discussions around the technology. For the last few years she’s been speaking to scientists, politicians, and federal regulators around the world about the potential risks and rewards of Crispr. “I think it’s really likely that in the not-too-distant future it will cure genetic disease,” she said. “But globally we need to come up with a consensus on moving forward in a responsible way.” In 2015, Doudna was part of a broad coalition of leading biologists who agreed to a worldwide moratorium on gene editing to the “germ line,” which is to say, edits that get passed along to subsequent generations. But it’s legally non-binding, and scientists in China have already begun experiments that involve editing the genome of human embryos. Using Crispr to cure inheritable genetic diseases is still a long way off, and fraught with ethical potholes. Which is why Doudna said people who are excited about the possibilities of Crispr shouldn’t look to the clinic for its first big successes, but rather to the farm field. “When I think about where we are likely to see the biggest impacts in the shortest amount of time, I really think it’s going to be in agriculture,” she said. Plant breeders have always been geneticists at heart. And with the precision and ease of Crispr, identifying and separating out desirable traits has the potential to speed up new crop development by several orders of magnitude. Agro-giants DuPont and Monsanto have invested in Crispr licenses to accelerate their R&D efforts toward creating crops that can withstand changing climates and new disease and pest burdens. In test plots around the world gene edited crops are already growing—from longer-lasting potatoes and flood-resistant rice to drought-hardy corn and mildew-proof wheat, to name just a few. As a tomato farmer, Doudna was most excited about a paper that came out just last month. In it, scientists from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York tackled some of the crop’s trickiest modern traits. While wild plants benefit from dropping fruit—it helps seed dispersal—farmers want plants where the fruit stays on, so mechanical pickers have an easier time harvesting them. When breeders found a trait called ‘jointless’ that did keep the fruit on the vine, they rushed to incorporate it into their domesticated tomato varieties. But when they crossed ‘jointless’ into existing tomato breeds, the resulting plants put out all these extra branches, actually diminishing the number of fruits they produced. Using genetics to trace back 10,000 years of tomato domestication, Cold Spring Harbor researchers discovered which genes led to that weird branching. Then they used Crispr to edit their activity. The result—tomato plants with great yields that don’t drop their fruits. “For me, that really illustrates the potential for this,” Doudna said. “Crispr allows plant breeders to do things that would have been very difficult, sometimes impossible in the past.” Go Back to Top.

If it is successful, it could see the company help protect millions of people with diabetes from an eye disease that leads to blindness. Last year researchers at the search and ads company announced that they had trained image recognition algorithms to detect signs of diabetes-related eye disease roughly as well as human experts. The software examines photos of a patient’s retina to spot tiny aneurisms indicating the early stages of a condition called diabetic retinopathy, which causes blindness if untreated. At the 2017 WIRED Business Conference in New York City today, a leader of Google’s project said that work has begun on integrating the technology into a chain of eye hospitals in India. The country is one of the many places around the world where a lack of ophthalmologists means many diabetics don’t get the recommended annual screening for diabetic retinopathy, said Lily Peng, a product manager with the Google Brain AI research group. “This kind of blindness is completely preventable, but because people can’t get screened, half suffer vision loss before they’re detected,” she said, describing the current situation in India. “One of the promises of this technology is being able to make healthcare more accessible.” There are more than 400 million people worldwide with diabetes, including 70 million in India. Peng, who is an MD, was featured on WIRED’s Next List of 20 tech visionaries creating the future earlier this year. In India, Google is working with the Aravind Eye Care System, a network of eye hospitals established in the late 1970s and credited with helping reduce the incidence of blindness caused by cataracts in the country. Aravind helped Google develop its retinal screening system by contributing some of the images needed to train its image parsing algorithms. The system uses the same deep learning technique that allows Google’s image search and photo storage service do things like differentiate between dogs, cats, and people. Google’s paper last year just described the accuracy of that technology when applied to retinal images, not its use in the clinic. Peng said today that Google has just finished a clinical study in India—meaning the technology was used in real patient care—with Aravind. Work is now under way on getting the technology into routine use with patients, she said. Peng dismissed suggestions that while this technology might be good for patients, it could mean fewer jobs for doctors. She said Google’s algorithms would instead do screening work not being done today due to skills shortages while freeing physicians for more important tasks. “There’s not enough expertise to go, we need to have our specialists working on treating people who are sick,” said Peng.

When David Limp thinks about the future of Alexa, the AI assistant he oversees at Amazon, he imagines a world not unlike Star Trek—a future in which you could be anywhere, asking anything, and an ambient computer would be there to fulfill your every need. “Imagine a world in the not-so-distant future where you could have infinite computing power and infinite storage,” Limp said today at WIRED’s 2017 Business Conference in New York. “If you take off the constrains of servers and building up infrastructure, what could you do?” Limp, who has worked at Amazon since 2010 as the senior vice president for devices, sees Alexa as a critical part of this future. Already, you can shout “Hey, Alexa,” and get the assistant to tell you the weather forecast, turn off the lights, hail an Uber, or thousands of other things that Amazon and developers have trained it to do. But Limp says there’s still plenty more work to be done before we live in the AI-assisted future he thinks about every day, and much of that effort has to do with training machines to better understand humans. Since Alexa made its debut in 2014, the virtual assistant has taken lease in dedicated devices like the Echo, Tap, Echo Dot, Echo Look, Echo Show, as well as dozens of other supported devices. All that interaction with humans has given Alexa plenty of voice data to parse through—data that’s helped train the assistant to understand preferences, recognize different accents, even figure out the intent of a request without specific keywords. A year ago, if you’d told Alexa to “order a car,” it wouldn’t have understood what you meant. (What, like, order one from the Amazon Marketplace?) Now, through improved machine learning, Alexa knows what you mean and will prompt you to enable an Uber or Lyft skill so that it can summon your ride. Of course, Alexa is far from perfect. Limp says one near-future goal would be improving Alexa’s understanding of anaphora—so if you ask, “Who’s the president of the United States?” and then follow up by asking, “How old is he?” Alexa knows you’re still talking about Donald Trump. Amazon is also tinkering with Alexa’s short-term and long-term memory, so that the bot can recall context from yesterday’s conversation as well as the thing you asked it five seconds ago. Those changes involve a shift toward making devices that aren’t personal but can work for everyone. Think more like a wall clock in the kitchen, which everyone in a household can glance at to get the time, rather than a smartphone, which is designed for one person to use. “As we design the interfaces for Alexa, whether voice or graphical, it’s about making it ambient and so that anybody can use it,” Limp said on stage. “If you ask for a timer and I ask for a timer, they’re both going to work.” In a world where devices will surround people all the time, those gadgets will have to understand what humans mean, however they choose to say it. For anyone who uses Alexa, that education is already under way: Every time someone talks to their Echo, the world inches a little bit closer to that Starship Enterprise future Limp imagines.

As senior vice president of technical infrastructure at Google, he’s in charge of the hundreds of thousands of servers in data centers spread across the planet to power the company’s ever widening range of services. He’s also the person that the company’s engineers turn to when all that computing power turns out not to be enough. Today at the 2017 Wired Business Conference in New York, Hölze explained that even with its enormous resources, Google has had to find ways to economize its operations in order to meet its ambitious goals. Most recently, he said, the company was forced to start building its own artificial intelligence chips because the company’s existing infrastructure just wouldn’t cut it. Around five years ago, Jeff Dean, who ran Google’s artificial intelligence group, realized that his team’s technique for speech recognition was getting really good. So good in fact, that he thought it was ready to move from the lab to the real world by powering Android’s voice-control system. But when Dean and Hölzle ran the numbers, they realized that if every Android user in the world used about three minutes of voice recognition time per day, Google would need twice as much computing power to handle it all. The world’s largest computing infrastructure, in other words, would have to double in size. “Even for Google that is not something you can afford, because Android is free, Android speech recognition is free, and you want to keep it free, and you can’t double your infrastructure to do that,” Hölzle says. What Google decided to do instead, Hölzle said, is create a whole new type of chip specialized exclusively for machine learning. He likens traditional CPU chips to everyday cars—they have to do a lot of things relatively well to make sure you get where you’r going. An AI chip, on the other hand, has to do just one thing exceptionally well. “What we built was the equivalent of a drag race car, it can only do one thing, go straight as fast as it can,” he says. “Everything else it is really, really bad at, but this one thing it is super good at.” Google’s custom chips could handle AI tasks far more efficiently than traditional chips, which meant the company could support not just voice recognition, but a broad range of other tasks as well without breaking the bank. Pattern Recognition This pattern has repeated itself again and again during Hölzle’s time at Google. He says that when he started at the company in 1999 (he was somewhere between the seventh and 11th employee hired by Google, depending on how you count), Google only had around 50 servers and was straining to support the number of search queries it received each day. But even with $25 million in venture funding, the company couldn’t afford to buy enough ready-made servers to meet its growing demand. “If we had done it with the machines, the servers, that people were using, professional servers, real servers, that would have blown our $25 million in an instant,” he says. “It really was not an option, so we were forced to look for other ways to do the same thing more cheaply.” Related Stories Cade Metz Google Rattles the Tech World With a New AI Chip for All Cade Metz The Race To Build An AI Chip For Everything Just Got Real Cade Metz Building an AI Chip Saved Google From Building a Dozen New Data Centers So Hölzle and company built their own servers out of cheap parts.

Google didn’t invent the idea of using big clusters of cheap machines in lieu of more expensive hardware—that honor might go to the nearly forgotten search engine Inktomi—but it did popularize the model by proving that it could work on a massive scale. Hölzle and his team had to do something similar years later when it found that off-the-shelf networking gear no longer met its needs. So few companies needed switches that could support the number machines Google had that no established networking company was interested in producing them. So, once again, Hölzle and his team had to build their own gear—something that other companies, like Facebook, now do as well. “These decisions become a lot easier if all the other alternatives are non-viable,” Hölzle says. “It’s not necessarily that we’re somehow bolder or more insightful, but it’s actually that for many of these things in our history, it was almost a forced choice, you didn’t really have a viable alternative that you could buy.” But Hölzle probably isn’t giving himself enough credit. Most people, after exhausting all the viable options, would conclude that their task is impossible. When Hölzle ran out of options, he created new ones. Go Back to Top.

Jigsaw, where she is the head of research and development, is a think tank within Alphabet tasked with fighting the unintended unsavory consequences of technological progress. Green’s radical strategy for tackling the dark side of the web? Talk directly to the humans behind it. That means listening to fake news creators, jihadis, and cyber bullies so that she and her team can understand their motivations, processes, and goals. “We look at censorship, cybersecurity, cyberattacks, ISIS—everything the creators of the internet did not imagine the internet would be used for,” Green said today at WIRED’s 2017 Business Conference in New York. Last week, Green traveled to Macedonia to meet with peddlers of fake news, those click-hungry opportunists who had such a sway over the 2016 presidential election in the US. Her goal was to understand the business model of fake news dissemination so that she and her team can create algorithms to identify the process and disrupt it. She learned that these content farms utilize social media and online advertising—the same tools used by legit online publishers. “[The problem of fake news] starts off in a way that algorithms should be able to detect,” she said. Her team is now working on a tool that could be shared across Google as well as competing platforms like Facebook and Twitter to thwart that system. ‘It’s mostly good people making bad decisions who join violent extremist groups.’ Along with fake news, Jigsaw is intensely focused on combatting online pro-terror propaganda. Last year, Green and her team travelled to Iraq to speak directly to ex-ISIS recruits. The conversations led to a tool called the Redirect Method, which uses machine learning detect extremist sympathies based on search patterns. Once detected, the Redirect Method serves these users videos that show the ugly side of ISIS—a counternarrative to the allure of the ideology. At the point that they are buying a ticket to join the caliphate, she said, it was too late. “It’s mostly good people making bad decisions who join violent extremist groups,” Green says. “So the job was: let’s respect that these people are not evil and they are buying into something and lets use the power of targeted advertising to reach them, the people who are sympathetic but not sold.” Since its launch last year, 300,000 people have watched videos served up by the Redirect Method—a total of more than half a million minutes, Green said. WIRED Business Conference Angela Watercutter Westworld’s Creators Know Why Sci-Fi Is So Dystopian Liz Stinson Apple’s Architect Says the Future of Offices Must Be Flexible Megan Molteni Crispr May Cure All Genetic Disease—One Day Beyond fake news and extremism, Green’s team has also created a tool to target toxic speech in comment sections on news organizations’ sites. They created Perspective, a machine-learning algorithm that uses context and sentiment training to detect potential online harassment and alert moderators to the problem. The beta version is being used by the likes of the New York Times. But as Green explained, it’s a constantly evolving tool. One potential worry is that it could be itself biased against certain words, ideas, even tones of speech. To counteract that risk, Jigsaw decided not to open up the API to allow others to set the parameters themselves, fearing that an authoritarian regime might use the tool for full-on censorship. “We have to take measures to keep these tools from being misused,” she said. Just like the internet itself, which has been used in destructive ways its creators could never have imagined, Green is aware that the solutions her team creates could also be abused. That risk is always on her mind, she says. But it’s not a reason to stop trying. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. fake news google terrorism Wired Business Conference 2017 Skip Social.

If You Care About Cities, Apple's New Campus Sucks Subscribe business culture design gear science security transportation photo video Search business culture design gear science security transportation photo video Photo Video Magazine Wired Insider Get Our Newsletter WIRED's biggest stories, delivered to your inbox. submit Author: Adam RogersAdam Rogers design 06.08.17 10:15 am If You Care About Cities, Apple's New Campus Sucks Dan Winters Share share tweet comment email The new headquarters Apple is building in Cupertino has the absolute best door handles. The greatest! They are, as my colleague Steven Levy writes, precision-milled aluminum rails that attach to glass doors—sliding and swinging alike—with no visible bolts. Everything in this building is the best. The toroid glass of the roof curves scientifically to shed rainwater. And if it never rains again (this being California), well, an arborist selected thousands of drought-tolerant new trees for the 175-acre site. Not every Apple employee will get to work in the new building—ouch!—but 12,000 will. Of course, it only has 9,000 parking spaces, but that’s supposed to encourage people to take an Apple shuttle to work. And once they arrive, they’re not going to want to leave. The fitness center has a climbing wall with pre-distressed stone. The concrete edges of the parking lot walls are rounded. The fire suppression systems come from yachts. Craftspeople harvested the wood paneling at the exact time of year the late Steve Jobs demanded—mid-winter—so the sap content wouldn’t be ruinously high. Come on! You don’t want sappy wood panels. This isn’t, like, Microsoft. Whether you call it the Ring (too JRR Tolkien), the Death Star (too George Lucas), or the Spaceship (too Buckminster Fuller), something has alighted in Cupertino. And no one could possibly question the elegance of its design and architecture. This building is $5 billion and 2.8 million square feet of Steve Jobsian-Jony Ivesian-Norman Fosterian genius. WIRED already said all that. But … one more one more thing. You can’t understand a building without looking at what’s around it—its site, as the architects say. From that angle, Apple’s new HQ is a retrograde, literally inward-looking building with contempt for the city where it lives and cities in general. People rightly credit Apple for defining the look and feel of the future; its computers and phones seem like science fiction. But by building a mega-headquarters straight out of the middle of the last century, Apple has exacerbated the already serious problems endemic to 21st-century suburbs like Cupertino—transportation, housing, and economics. Apple Park is an anachronism wrapped in glass, tucked into a neighborhood. The Architecture Apple Park isn’t the first high-end, suburban corporate headquarters. In fact, that used to be the norm. Look back at the 1950s and 1960s and, for example, the Connecticut General Life Insurance HQ in Hartford or John Deere’s headquarters in Moline, Illinois. “They were stunningly beautiful, high modernist buildings by quality architects using cutting-edge technology to create buildings sheathed in glass with a seamless relationship between inside and outside, dependent on the automobile to move employees to the site,” says Louise Mozingo, a landscape architect at UC Berkeley and author of Pastoral Capitalism: A History of Suburban Corporate Landscapes. “There was a kind of splendid isolation that was seen as productive, capturing the employees for an entire day and in the process reinforcing an insular corporate culture.” By moving out of downtown skyscrapers and building in the suburbs, corporations were reflecting 1950s ideas about cities—they were dirty, crowded, and unpleasantly diverse. The suburbs, though, were exclusive, aspirational, and architectural blank slates. (Also, buildings there are easier to secure and workers don’t go out for lunch where they might hear about other, better jobs.) It was corporatized white flight. (Mozingo, I should add, speaks to this retrograde notion in Levy’s WIRED story.) Silicon Valley, though, never really played by these rules. IBM built a couple of research sites modeled on its East Coast redoubts, but in general, “Silicon Valley has thrived on using rather interchangeable buildings for their workplaces,” Mozingo says. You start in a garage, take over half a floor in a crummy office park, then take over the full floor, then the building, then get some venture capital and move to a better office park. “Suddenly you’re Google, and you have this empire of office buildings along 101." And then when a bust comes or your new widget won’t widge, you let some leases lapse or sell some real estate. More than half of the lot where Apple sited its new home used to be Hewlett Packard. The Googleplex used to be Silicon Graphics. It’s the circuit of life. Except when you have a statement building like the Spaceship, the circuit can’t complete. If Apple ever goes out of business, what would happen to the building? The same thing that happened to Union Carbide’s. That’s why nobody builds these things anymore. Successful buildings engage with their surroundings—and to be clear, Apple isn’t in some suburban arcadia. It’s in a real live city, across the street from houses and retail, near two freeway onramps. Except the Ring is mostly hidden behind artificial berms, like Space Mountain at Disneyland. “They’re all these white elephants. Nobody knows what the hell to do with them. They’re iconic, high-end buildings, and who cares?” Mozingo says. “You have a $5 billion office building, incredibly idiosyncratic, impossible to purpose for somebody else. Nobody’s going to move into Steve Jobs’ old building.” The Landscape But that’s all future-Apple’s problem. Today-Apple’s problem is how the campus fits into Cupertino and crowded, congested, expensive Silicon Valley. Between 2010 and 2015 the San Francisco Bay Area added 640,000 jobs, with more than a third of that growth in tech. But the region didn’t add nearly enough housing; with the exception of a spike during the boom years leading up to the 2008 recession, the number of new housing units built in the city of San Francisco has trended steadily downward, and the same is true for other Bay Area cities. Here’s what happens when supply fails to meet demand: The median price for a home in the Bay Area has climbed to $800,000. It’s even higher in Silicon Valley. That’s starting to change. San Francisco has 62,000 units in the pipeline, and San Jose is adding thousands every year, too. (To be clear, those numbers are still far lower than places like Houston and Atlanta.) But the towns along the 101 and 280, the homes of companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook? Nope. Cupertino, Mountain View, and Palo Alto all have tens of thousands of workers in the tech business, adding more and more all the time, but those cities have been reluctant to build new houses or apartments. How is this Apple’s problem? “Apple’s obviously very important to the city, and when they came in with that plan, we understood this wasn’t going to be just any development,” says Aarti Shrivastava, Cupertino’s assistant city manager. “They had certain needs.” Heightened sensitivity to security was one of them, which meant no public access—and even closing a major road. In the early days of the project, reports suggest Apple wasn’t willing to participate in “community benefits,” financial or otherwise, and Cupertino’s city council didn’t seem too willing to push one of the city’s biggest employers and taxpayers. The mayor at the time tried to propose higher taxes on the company, but the city council didn’t support the move. Over time, though, Apple committed to giving the city some money to help with traffic and parking. “We had to bring them into our world. They don’t do urban design. They don’t do planning. We needed to talk to each other,” Shrivastava says. In its HP incarnation, the site had about 5,000 workers; the new Apple complex will more than double that. Just 10 percent of them live in Cupertino, but according to an Environmental Impact Report on the project that an Apple spokesperson sent me, that still means that demand for Cupertino housing will increase by 284 percent. Apple is paying a “Housing Mitigation Fee” to the city. It’s based on overall square footage, but it turns out Apple is only adding about 800,000 square feet of building over what used to be on the site. So the company agreed to double the usual fee. But since the city had already halved the fee, so Apple is just paying … the fee. It’ll be about $5 million. You can do math: Ten percent of people working in Cupertino means that 90 percent of the people in the Spaceship will commute. Most of them live in San Jose (10 miles east) and San Francisco (45 miles north). The lack of a cohesive regional transportation network in the Bay Area privileges cars, which is why Google and other tech companies started fielding their own buses in the last few years. (In 2014, San Franciscans angry about gentrification met Google’s buses with resistance.) Apple has shuttles that range the entire peninsula and into the East Bay and has committed to raising the number of trips to its headquarters not in single-occupancy vehicles to 34 percent. According to the EIR, just 1.5 percent of commute trips to Apple’s existing facilities are on public transit; by that calculation, the company says, the public bus system’s plenty robust enough. That logic is as circular as the building; if you don’t build it, they won’t come. Of course that wasn’t all Apple worked on with Cupertino. Because part of the new campus subsumed what was going to be public space, Apple paid $8.2 million so Cupertino could build a park somewhere else. And the company agreed to help address the community’s major concern: traffic. Cupertino already had big plans for walkability and bikability; Apple is paying for a lot of those efforts around its campus. It ponied up $250,000 for a feasibility study on improving one of the nearby intersections, and an extra $1 million for another. Recognizing that not having enough parking for everyone on site meant that people were going to park in nearby neighborhoods, Apple is paying $250,000 to Santa Clara and $500,000 to Sunnyvale in parking restitution. “We worked very hard with both cities to figure out what amount would be OK, and Apple was very open to that,” Shrivastava says. Oh, and two big ones: Apple is one of Cupertino’s biggest sources of tax revenue, but the city used to forgive all of Apple’s business-to-business sales tax. Now the city will get 65 percent of it. And the company built, at a cost of around $5 million, a system to bring recycled water from Sunnyvale to hydrate the new landscape. That’s not a direct community benefit, but developments at two more sites, the Hamptons and the old Vallco Mall, will also use that water if and when they get built. Still, though...Apple has $250 billion in cash. Against that, these community benefits feel small. The company could have chipped in to double the frequency of CalTrain’s commuter rail. It could have built a transit center in Cupertino, which, unlike Mountain View and Palo Alto, has none. “Apple could have done anything. Money was no object,” says Allison Arieff, editorial director for the San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association and lead author of its recent report on corporate campuses. “They want to be innovative in everything, and they’re not innovative in this thing.” Apple is instead making significant improvements to roads and highways. “If the intractable problems of the region are housing and congestion, they’re giving the finger to all that,” Arieff says. The problems in the Bay Area (and Los Angeles and many other cities) are a lot more complicated than an Apple building, of course. Cities all have to balance how they feel about adding jobs, which can be an economic benefit, and adding housing, which also requires adding expensive services like schools and transit. Things are especially tough in California, where a 1978 law called Proposition 13 radically limits the amount that the state can raise property taxes yearly. Not only did its passage gut basic services the state used to excel at, like education, but it also turned real estate into the primary way Californians accrued and preserved personal wealth. If you bought a cheap house in the 1970s in the Bay Area, today it’s a gold mine—and you are disincentivized from doing anything that would reduce its value, like, say, allowing an apartment building to be built anywhere within view. Meanwhile California cities also have to figure out how to pay for their past employees’ pensions, an ever-increasing percentage of city budgets. Since they can’t tax old homes and can’t build new ones, commercial real estate and tech booms look pretty good. “It’s a lot to ask a corporate campus to fix those problems,” Arieff says. But that doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t try. Some companies are: The main building of the cloud storage company Box, for example, is across the street from the Redwood City CalTrain station, and the company lets people downtown park in its lot on weekends. “The architecture is neither here nor there, but it’s a billion times more effective than the Apple campus,” Arieff says. That’s a more contemporary approach than building behind hills, away from transit. When those companies are transnational technology corporations, it’s even harder to make that case. “Tech tends to be remarkably detached from local conditions, primarily because they’re selling globally,” says Ed Glaeser, a Harvard economist who studies cities. “They’re not particularly tied to local suppliers or local customers.” So it’s hard to get them to help fix local problems. They have even less of an incentive to solve planning problems than California homeowners do. “Even if they see the problem and the solution, there’s not a way to sell that. This is why there are government services,” Arieff says. “You can’t solve a problem like CalTrain frequency or the jobs-to-housing ratio with a market-based solution.” Cities are changing; a more contemporary approach to commercial architecture builds up instead of out, as the planning association’s report says. Apple’s ring sites 2.5 million square feet on 175 acres of rolling hills and trees meant to evoke the Stanford campus. The 60-story tall Salesforce Tower in San Francisco has 1.5 million square feet, takes up about an acre, has a direct connection to a major transit station—the new Transbay Terminal—and cost a fifth of the Apple ring. Stipulated, the door handles probably aren’t as nice, but the views are killer. The Future Cupertino is the kind of town that technology writers tend to describe as “once-sleepy” or even, and this should really set off your cliche alarm, “nondescript.” But Shrivastava had me meet her for coffee at Main Street Cupertino, a new development that—unlike the rotten strip malls along Stevens Creek Blvd—combines cute restaurants and shops with multi-story residential development and a few hundred square feet of grass that almost nearly sort of works as a town square. Across the actual street from Main Street, the old Vallco Mall—one of those medieval fortress-like shopping centers with a Christmas-sized parking lot for a moat—has become now Cupertino’s most hotly debated site for new development. (The company that built Main Street owns it.) Like all the other once-sleepy, nondescript towns in Silicon Valley, Cupertino knows it has to change. Shrivastava knows that change takes time. It takes even longer, though, if businesses are reluctant partners. In the early 20th century, when industrial capitalists were first starting to get really, really rich, they noticed that publicly financed infrastructure would help them get richer. If you own land that you want to develop into real estate, you want a train that gets there and trolleys that connect it to a downtown and water and power for the houses you’re going to build. Maybe you want libraries and schools to induce families to live there. So you team up with government. “In most parts of the US, you open a tap and drink the water and it won’t kill you. There was a moment when this was a goal of both government and capital,” Mozingo says. “Early air pollution and water pollution regulations were an agreement between capitalism and government.” Again, in the 1930s and 1940s, burgeoning California Bay Area businesses realized they’d need a regional transit network. They worked for 30 years alongside communities and planners to build what became BART, still today a strange hybrid between regional connector and urban subway. More About Apple Steven Levy Apple’s New Campus: An Exclusive Look Inside the Mothership David Pierce Apple's HomePod Puts Siri in a Speaker David Pierce Siri Finally Got Its Coming Out Party Tech companies are taking baby steps in this same direction. Google added housing to the package deal surrounding the construction of its new HQ in the North Bayshore area—nearly 10,000 apartments. (That HQ is a collection of fancy pavilion-like structures from famed architect Bjarke Ingels.) Facebook’s new headquarters (from famed architect Frank Gehry) is supposed to be more open to the community, maybe even with a farmers’ market. Amazon’s new headquarters in downtown Seattle, some of 10 million square feet of office space the company has there, comes with terrarium-like domes that look like a good version of Passengers. So what could Apple have built? Something taller, with mixed-use development around it? Cupertino would never have allowed it. But putting form factor aside, the best, smartest designers and architects in the world could have tried something new. Instead it produced a building roughly the shape of a navel, and then gazed into it. Steven Levy wrote that the headquarters was Steve Jobs’ last great project, an expression of the way he saw his domain. It may look like a circle, but it’s actually a pyramid—a monument, more suited to a vanished past than a complicated future.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 239 Plus 1 on G+ 1179 Share on Facebook 437 Share on Twitter Total Shares1418 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SafetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms that: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play Store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix.

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). Yan Minari You better tell us more about how you set up this. stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO David Gabel And you are a loud mouth keyboard warrior that loves to talk a big game, but in reality have little to no control over anything and use web forums to spout obscenities and violent threats to make yourself feel better. DJMix How is it only bobbuttons' comment that made sense? They all basically say the same thing. David Gabel Unlike the others, he said it intelligently rather than in a rude and attacking way. nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Ravonus Damitri this guy is a nut ha... I agree with you 100% bro. Ravonus um yes you can fake it... Sure you can't block the traffic... but you sure can make it seem like the traffic is coming from your phone and not being used to tether.. Which is what these apps do.. SMH lol Latheryin If that is what you wish to believe. OK. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. My1 even if you dont have any right to access netflix, the whole point of netflix and others is making it easier to use those than to do piracy but when netflix goes around branding the rooted users as pirates and blocking them, they sure arent helping their purpose. especially if netflix is (I dont have it so I didnt try) runs on VGA and DVI Screens (no HDCP) where you can just capture the stuff. I mean it's say same withz Bluray Playback on PC, in addition to needing a Bluray Drive, you need an HDCP Compliant Graphics card, bus encryption, and HDCP compliant Monitor, and not to forget You Piece of PowerDVD which you have to upgrade (aka buy again) every few years because the older versions dont get Key Updates. and then we have stuff like unskippable trailers and all the other bluntly said Bullshit when dealing with that. of course Piracy is easier, just download the file and play it on any device you want, no internet and nothing required and no problems. My1 and even if one piece of software wont run in an Admin account, with LUA even on Admin they arent having and privileges unless you kick in the UAC, and to top it, even if the app wont be running if I force it as admin, and only runs with active LUA concept, I can still run anything else as admin and screw the other software running as normal user over (cheatengine is the perfect example for this) Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. My1 well but from another side, root can also be used to just patch any holes that were there. actually happened a few times before. My1 banking apps dont have a reason for a root check if they are done properly, i.e. TANs are generated with an air-gapped extra device. TANs on the phone are in general not safe and if the TAN is able to be generated offline, someone could use an exploit to root, steal the secret for TAN generation and boom, it's over. and dont even start thinking about sms-TAN, it's even worse. also when I just want to look into what my account is doing, I am not happy when I cant do so. My Bank (Hypovereinsbank) more or less recently blocked root and well I just RootCloaked that thing into oblivion and can do my stuff. but I'll probably change anyway since they sadly have no good way of TANs (just paper-based list-TANs, SMS and app) TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? My1 well at least a rooted phone is objectively better than a non rooted one, but relatively and subjectively speaking, if a non-rooted phone is good enough for someone then let it be so. EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Thomas Gladdines That's nonsense, the recovery works fine with or without a locked bootloader. Only fastboot won't work but that's only needed when you don't have a custom recovery to flash images. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player My1 actually it depends on how the build the DRM, if it's made to be only active when you are for example streaming netflix and does nothing for local content, which for sure can be legal (e.g. ripping DVDs in finland is no problem because CSS is not considered an "effective" protection method ever since 2007) although if the DRM would be everywhere it wouldnt be funny. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. My1 debugging is a joke right? If it's not WHAT ARE THEY DOING? I mean debugging is a core part of developing and any developer probably has it active m477 I've only seen it working like that once, so it might be an isolated case. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. Actually l like bezels Why? What do you get with root? BobButtons Primarily for system level ad-blocking. None of the non-root options can even compare. I refuse to allow ads when they have the ability to fill the entire screen and vibrate the phone. Even with being able to block ads, I still purchase the ad-free option of apps I support. Matthew Wilson Updates. Security updates. DJMix What do you mean what do we get from root? We get everything! Everything! Actually l like bezels Well not Netflix. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. My1 well yeah if you actually bypass the thing you are a pirate (not a thief because stealing != illegal copy) but branding people pirates and making the software refuse if something that MIGHT be used for piracy is on the device isnt not better. 天地人 Theft is when I take your bike and it's gone and you do not have a bike anymore. When I pirate, are you losing your software or your right to sell your software? Plus, if you actually developed software, I'd probably pay for it since you aren't some big corporation. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. 天地人 Of course it depends on what you're watching. The same ideology cannot be applied to everything. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. My1 well I would and I do give my money for legal media consumption when possible but when some things have region locks, meaning I cant import them or other stupid Ideas like Netflix not doing rooted devices, I certainly wouldnt like giving money for something I cant use. My1 not really. I have streamed and/or downloaded stuff in the past (coz not available here) just to buy their blurays years after when it finally came to germany Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. My1 but doesnt the actual unlock wipe everything? EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. Captain_Invisible But you don't even need to root to get blocked. Just using a custom ROM or having an unlocked bootloader triggers it.. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. My1 well knox flag is annoying but I honestly like my Galaxy Note 4 which is the last good Samsung in my opinion becase anything later either doesnt have microSD, doesnt have a swappable batter or doesnt have both (Galaxy S6 for example) but these are 2 very important things and I really like some parts of the samsung rom, although a lot of other parts (e.g. the launcher) are junk and get replaced instantly, also root makes the thing work as I want. and well many non samsung devices use the on-screen navigation bar, one thing I despise after having a horrible experience on my tablet. and (at least outside of samsung) the fiun goes on with removing the headphone jack which is something on my absolute instant KO list for phones. I dont see the point of a digital sound connection on a phone because sound itself is analog by definition and I think the DAC in a multi-hundred euro device is better than in some cheap headphones. and not to forget the features. samsung had many features WAY earlier than AOSP did, which certainly doesnt make it so much better at least from this viewpoint, although aosp is certainly getting better with every version. but even though I like my note 4 I must say that it is by no means perfect. everything is better and worse than others if you put the right requirements in. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. Richard Markert A 7" device is too small. My tablets start at 10" minimum , and go to 12" maximum. Content consumption is unpleasant on anything smaller, and I barely watch anything on a display smaller than one of my 24" computer displays. Yes, you're right almost all of them are software features, but they are locked out when you put a junkrom on there. And Samsung Pay? Well, call me when Android Pay is compatible with magstripe readers. My bank still doesn't support Android Pay that I know of, either. GearVR. How shall I put this? Computer VR is currently overpriced - unless you want to go ahead and buy me a $600 headset, a pair of controllers @ $130 each, AND you still need to buy me a $1400 PC to run VR titles at an acceptable framerate, because while my laptop can still run AAA titles at high framerates and 1080p, it can't do VR that good. My GearVR cost me $50, it's a convenience thing, every VR title is locked 60fps, the graphics are "good enough" and I can even take calls from VR with my Bluetooth headphones. I don't care about Google Voice. Or any sort of data-based calling. US data networks are still too unstable and limited. I am pretty much guaranteed to be able to make a call anywhere I can see at least the tiniest bit of 1x signal, but if the data network is gone, or you used all your gigabytes, you can't make calls anymore on your preferred number. A lot of these things you say you simply "don't need" them, and that's how I feel about root. And about pretty much everything you care about. I don't do ebooks, I don't do movies or tv, I barely play basic games. I do listen to a LOT of music though, and yes a lot of it was stolen from when I was younger and stupider and didn't understand that without compensation there will be no content. Oh, and BTW, Knox is a good thing. It's how I have system-wide ad blocking without rooting, and how I can have my Secure Folder. You seriously think Vertu phones are luxury? Classy even! Vertu are tacky, garish and gaudy. "Look at how much money I have." Nothing classy about that ugly diamond-crusted turd. Look, I really don't care what your choices are. I'm glad you have the choice to find a device that makes you happy. But you seriously need to stop acting like your choice is the only choice. It's not. And I hope to god it never will be, because at that point, Android will no longer be a platform that fits my needs and I might as well go to Apple. Because you see, what fits my needs, is a device that provides me with everything I have, out of the box, without having to modify it. Samsung does that. They give me everything I want, and nothing I don't. And when the Note 8 comes out, the S-Pen is going to blast it so far ahead that there simply won't be any other phone in the running, not even the S9. I would still have my Note 7 if they would let me. Railwayman Good that you have your Samsung. Also great that you have your 10-12 inch tablets. I assume you bring them everywhere? Very is easy more elegant than a Samsung. It doesn't mean they are the best but way better looking than a Galaxy 8, which I have been tried and I just don't see any reason to get it because of the way Samsung design things. You like to be locked down to a carrier. Google Voice work perfectly well here without any network problems. If the network coverage is so bad that modern services doesn't work I rather jump to a satellite provider if I really need the ability to call from the middle of nowhere. I wouldn't get VZW and eliminate my device choice site to them being very restrictive about what I am allowed to use. Having a carrier dependent phone number is very... 1996. I just don't accept such a limitation - especially not the thing called roaming. I just switch my SIM card to a local one and continue to receive calls as usual. The beauty of GV. If you think iOS is the way to go if Grace UX would disappear I think you should get the iPhone then. It seems like out of the box is the most important aspect. I just don't know any device that has an out of the box experience even close to my requirements. Samsung is certainly furthest way from them. I just dislike their devices because of their design, software, carrier affiliation and serious restrictions. They just feel like a budget device full of carrier advertisement and bloatware. Richard Markert I disagree with you in every possible way. Yes, I do take at least my Surface 3 almost everywhere. My Z10 LTE goes when I'll want to play games or watch Netflix on a tiny screen with crappy headphones. Vertu: You say elegant, I say gaudy, tacky, trashy and fucking ugly, like most things marketed to people with more money than God and less sense than a cricket. I don't know where you live, work, play or travel, but many times a year I'm driving in places, especially the highways, that will have no data coverage. It's that simple. All your google voice hijinks mean nothing when you have -100 dBm of 1x and the mobile data network is completely unavailable. I can still make and receive calls at that point, because Verizon, but you're shit out of luck because you only give people your GV (interface is barf, btw) number. Oh, and for the record, I just flashed the US Unlocked FW to my S8, so now I have no Verizon junkware or restrictions, like my S7e before it. And yes, at this point in my life, I'm sick and tired of having to do the software developers' job for them. When I was younger I found all that rom cooking, kernel coding, smali editing, adb pushing, su manipulating stuff fun and exciting, but now all I want is a phone with the features that I want that Just Works OOB. I also feel the way you do about stock android. It's design, included software, limitations and style are not appealing. And every phone is "a carrier advertisement", and has always been that way. Until the S8, every phone came with a carrier logo if you bought from a carrier. I get what you want from a phone, I really do. You want a basic device with no features that you can add onto to do what you want. But man, you gotta stop acting like you're the Westboro Baptist Church and Samsung is the homosexual community. Railwayman Samsung is not the homosexual community, right. They are the mainstream community where everyone eat at McDonald's.:) The homosexual community is more about being different rather than following the mainstream, i.e. the opposite of Samsung (it is hard to be more Average Joe adjusted than they are...). The day I really want coverage in "every possible place" is the day I get myself a satellite phone, especially if I am to drive in remote land where I can't rely on decent carrier coverage. Your attempts to put down Google Voice is amusing. Verizon are going to shut down their CDMA network and HTC U11 is already out, with support for their LTE but not the old fashioned thing also known as 1X.:) It is also amusing that you argue that hard against vanilla Android. Did you ever consider iOS or Windows Phone? If I would dislike vanilla that much, down to a dislike for Material Design I would switch platform immediately. If I don't like the system the way its creator intended it then perhaps it isn't for me and I switch. Relying on some third party OEM to "modify it to my liking" is a bit naive. A Samsung has something that is an "Android based OS" very much like Nokia X/XL had the Android based "Nokia Software Platform". I also notice your misconception about how other devices work. My device runs perfectly well. It just... works. It has a lot of features not present on a Samsung (yes, I have used the S 8/Plus), consume 0.1% per hour in standby, provide me 12-13 hours SOT and simply do more things than any "out-of-the-box Samsung" does and do them well. Samsung make pretty simple devices, with ill designed software full of bloatware and "added value" applications and services reducing performance and increase power consumption. I would say bling. Then we have other devices offering more useful features, higher performance, lower power consumption, more elegant design and so on. What they don't offer is the marketing known as Samsung. It's a good thing, actually - it leads to better value for money. BTW, Google Voice is simply a vastly superior service compared to VZW. You can start travel (out of the US) or trying to get your texts synced into your Google account with your carrier based service... Bragging about 1X is like bragging about EDGE coverage in... 2017. "My carrier is better than yours because I have 1X service on the soon-to-be-gone CDMA network on my Samsung and it makes it so much better than using modern IP based services! I am truly modern with my Samsung! My phone number is also controlled by my carrier and I must pay roaming when I travel, which is great - more money to Verizon! Much, much better than using GV on a data plan!" The day I need "coverage out in the nowhere land" I either get the satellite phone or some burner for that very purpose (it's a case of simply routing the GV calls to that thing). I know since before that modern communication services are a bit alien to proud owners of carrier branded Samsung devices. It is hard to think outside the box - much easier to just use Samsung with branding and everything.:) Good luck with your Samsung. Consider an iPhone next time. Apple has a new one coming and it can give you some taste of what being unlocked means (buy it from Apple Store). I think it can be enlightening, especially if you try the Genius Bar as well (i.e. better service than Samsung could ever offer through the carriers). Richard Markert I get it, you're a Google and Stock Android zealot. I read maybe 3 words of your damn novel. I do want you to answer this question without a dissertation And 500 page thesis: what are you going to do when you're in the middle of nowhere in a dead sport for data and your car breaks down? Railwayman The day I know that I will be in need for 1X coverage on Verizon I get a burner phone with such support before traveling. You make it sound like it is something really and truly unique with such coverage and that your Samsung is a marvel because it offer it. Verizon just introduced a flip phone with full support for their LTE network. So it doesn't take a Samsung to get there. The only requirement I have is tethering (if the purpose is to use the device of choice) - basic talk/text will do otherwise. So no, I just don't need a Samsung even in the "1X middle of the nowhere with a broken car" scenario. If it is very important with calling in dead spots - go and check Iridium, GlobalStar or Thuraya. I would go down that route in an instant if I really need coverage in "no mans land". So no, there are no single scenario where a Samsung is "needed" for whatever reason. Everything that brand can do can be done with other brands. Simple as that. Richard Markert Why do you always write a novel? We get it, you hate Samsung like Trump hates Mexicans. Shut up already. Railwayman I don't hate that brand is overrated and hyped. Mexicans are approximately 1286 times more sophisticated and polished than any Samsung. They don't even have Knox, which is a major benefit. Now go and enjoy 1X on your Galaxy. Don't forget the grave beer when VZW down, though. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? Mariano Moreira I am using Factory Images because I can choose to only use Bootslot B this way. Bootslot A on this current Pixel and the 3 before it has the non-working mic and no working headphone jack issue. I hear the issue is resolved on newer handsets, but have not RMA'd this device yet. I need the microphone and headphone jack, so letting the phone do an OTA and move me to Bootslot A is no-go. *I have N2G47O installed on both Bootslot A and Bootslot B, currently. Only Bootslot A has the audio issue even thought the exact same Factory Image is installed. saf1927 Oh, wasn't aware of that. Did it affect all the old devices? I got mine at launch but haven't experienced the issues you describe. Is there a way to reproduce them? I normally either take the OTA or flash the OTA images via fastboot. Mariano Moreira Allegedly only 1% of devices (I just have bad luck, I suppose.) https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsIW_gxTpXX3s/?hl=by I have posts around late November- early December on in that thread about mic/headphone jack issue My 1st device was fine until after the 2nd Update, but I had not diagnosed Bootslot A/B discrepancy. Wasn't until after 2nd Device (1st Replacement) that I have been able to always get Bootslot A to have faulty mic on my replacement devices. My Cousin and his girlfriend both have Pixel XLs. He had a dead Mic out of the box but currently neither his nor his Girlfriend's Pixel XL has mic issue. Even with forcing Bootslot A for a month of testing. I most likely have another faulty device, just this is my 4th Pixel from Google and everything is fine except Bootslot A. jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... My1 yeah, I do root for theming and stuff, but srsly they literally are throwing oil in the Piracy and DRM discussions with this. Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix.

Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... My1 I think their problem is rather that rooted users *might* be able to capture the decrypted stream using root or whatever and they are afraid of that. although on PC you have admin permissions and netflix has no problems iirc. Linus Monie Yeah, exactly, its not like people will prefer to pirate the stream on their phone (at least I wouldn't...), so that was my first thought of why they made this change. Now that I think about it though, its probably not so much of a Netflix decision as it is a licensing issue with one of their "film sources". (can't think of a better word for it rn..) Licensing issues are a bitch when you need to adapt to as many as Netflix has... My1 yeah true. pirating on phone makes (quoting austin from game theory) NO. GOD. DAMN. SENSE. I mean I dunno whether you can automate that so good and/or get it fast enough, especially with the relatively low storage, no LAN capability and so on. BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. My1 I have never tried but if netflix can run over a non-HDCP connection like DVI or VGA, there's literally no reason to use a phone for piracy. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. My1 or use DVI if possible, even better. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have? Mike Hunt One of these https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170514131212&SearchText=media+box+mini+m8s Brock Reed I'm not even getting the "not compatible" message, it's just not showing up at all. Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk.

Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it?

DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money...

Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Smart speakers are pretty good listeners, too. Which makes you wonder if your conversations are staying at home. Apple raised the question when it talked up the security and privacy aspects of its newly unveiled HomePod, a Siri-powered speaker that takes aim at the Amazon Echo and Google Home. It's an intriguing point to consider at a time when millions of consumers have purchased a smart speaker for their home. While Google and Amazon spend a lot of time talking about the intelligence of their respective assistants and the convenience they offer, there's little mention of security or privacy. These voice assistants for the home all generally work the same: They're only listening after you activate with a wake word, and then the audio is recorded, sent to the company's servers and given a response. Recorded audio is already a topic of debate. In Amazon's battle over Echo data in a murder case, the company argued that the First Amendment protected voice commands but eventually handed over the recordings. Here's where the three major smart speakers stand on protecting a person's privacy, both from the government and from hackers. Encryption Apple's HomePod, Google Home and Amazon Echo all encrypt the voice recordings sent to their respective servers. But there are varying degrees of how they keep the data secret. Smart home speakers, from left: Apple HomePod, Amazon Dot and Echo, and Google Home. Reuters / CNET / Google At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this week,  Phil Schiller, the head of Apple's marketing, said the HomePod's data would be encrypted, but he did not go into detail. A person familiar with HomePod's development said it would have the same level of encryption as Siri and HomeKit. In its iOS security guide from March, Apple noted that Siri communications occur on servers over HTTPS, which encrypts data between an iPhone and another device. Data for the Google Home is encrypted in transit and at rest, which means that it's protected as it heads to Google's servers and encoded again where it's stored. On the Amazon Echo, conversations with Alexa are also encrypted in transit and at rest from your device to Amazon's cloud servers and "securely stored," a spokeswoman said in an email. This mostly means that your data is unlikely to be stolen or spied on as it's being sent to Apple's, Google's or Amazon's servers. But when it comes to protecting people from government requests, that's a different story. ID, please? Amazon was able to provide data for a murder trial because all the recordings, even though they were encrypted, are linked to individuals. "The recordings are securely stored in the [Amazon Web Services] cloud and tied to your account to allow the service to be personalized for each user," an Amazon spokeswoman said in an email.

Investigators in Arkansas have a search warrant to collect data from an Amazon Echo belonging to James Bates, charged with the murder of a man in... Similarly, Google Home collects data from your apps, your search and location history, and your voice commands, which are all tied to your Google account. Each Google Home requires an account tied to it, but it's possible to create dummy accounts that wouldn't have all your personal information. That's different from the Echo, for which you need an Amazon account -- which has your credit card information and shipping address. If a government agency requests data from Google or Amazon from a voice assistant, they can point to accounts associated with the user. It's a different situation with the HomePod. The data sent from Apple's speaker is anonymized, meaning there's no name or Apple ID attached to your commands. It works just like Siri, with random identifiers used only within the device. So if the government requests Siri data on a specific user, Apple would not be able to pick that info out of millions of random numbers. That's useful, considering Apple gets slammed with thousands of national security requests every year. Amazon and Google both have policies for dealing with demands for data on the Echo and the Home. Amazon won't release data unless there's a "valid and binding legal demand," while Google fights to narrow down more than 45,550 requests a year. And for both companies, the recordings are saved until you decide to delete them manually. For Siri, voice recordings are saved for six months on Apple's voice recognition servers to understand a user better. After that, they're deleted automatically and another copy -- without any identifiers -- helps improve Siri for up to two years. With anonymized IDs, Apple's speakers have a much more compelling argument for not handing over data: They can't find it. In the game of hide and seek with your voice data, the advantage -- for now -- goes to Apple. This article originally appeared on CNET. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

The company has created a series of ads for the Google Home, mostly to highlight the Home's temporary price drop, and one of them is... not good. The ad isn't too bad until the end, when the speaker says "And they'll be like 'O.M.G', and you'll be like 'I K-N-O.W'," at which point it entered Fellow Kids territory.

I, for one, am in the hilarious camp. I think I might be in the target audience for this ad. Tim Harman Yea, it's so stupid that it's funny which I think is what they're going for. I mean, Bruno Mars? Qbancelli Dudes getting worked out about some words spoken in a commercial, lol nxtiak I like the current trend of Google commercials. This has the same voice from the Google Photo Scan app commercial. It's funny. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEyDt0DNjWU Rob Agree with you a lot Willie Chalmers III I like the voice, but what she says annoys me. If Google has determined that this style of advertising increases revenue, I'm okay with it. TechGirl90 Really?......It can always be worse, like this commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lwh2xA4uvo Gjorgi Lazarovski WHAT. THE. FUCK. TechGirl90 LOL! My thoughts exactly when I first saw this Commercial. Oliver Cervera ✔ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHA DanSan what the hell did i just watch? serious question. TechGirl90 One of the worst Commercials LG could ever air. Glad they gotten better with their Marketing though, because this is beyond Cringe-Worthy and come across as desperate to try and get attention of Consumers but ends up deterring them even further away with their Marketing Tactics with this Ad.

You know that you need specific keywords to boost your website traffic, but we’re about to throw another curveball at you – latent semantic indexing (LSI). It sounds like a complicated term, but if you understand how basic SEO works you’re already halfway there. Below I’ll explain not only what this means but also how you can use it to help boost your SEO strategy and grow your business. What is Latent Semantic Indexing? How does it help SEO? Latent semantic indexing is a concept that search engines like Google use to discover how a term and content work together to mean the same thing. In other words, in order to understand how LSI works, you need to understand that search engines are smart enough to identify your content’s context and synonyms related to your keywords. However, without LSI keywords it takes the search engines a lot of effort to look for these synonyms and the relation of your keywords to the content on your site. With that said, search engines like Google rank those websites using LSI keywords higher than those that do not. By using LSI keywords, you’re better able to create content that flows in a more conversational way. Using a specific keyword will generate results that are similar to the topic you’re discussing. This way you’re not overstuffing your content with the same keyword, making it almost unreadable by your audience. It also helps that you’re including LSI to provide the right information to the correct audience. When you use LSI keywords, your audience is able to find the answer to their search quicker and easier, thus generating more traffic to your business’s website. How you can find LSI keywords? Still confused? It’s because LSI keywords make more sense when you can see examples and know how to find them. Searching for the right keywords means using the right tools, so consider some of the tools below: Google Search One of the easiest ways to find your keywords is by going straight to the source. Perform a Google search to see which keywords or phrases are associated with a specific term. For example, we took a search of the word “dog.” This is a great way to find your LSI keywords because you’re seeing exactly what Google links with the specific word. You can use these phrases or keywords as a jump off point for your LSI keywords. If you can incorporate into your writings the keywords/phrases associated with what Google is already doing, you’re on the right track. Google Keyword Planner You’ll need to create a Google AdWords account in order to use the Keyword Planner. Once you’ve signed in to Google, you can access the Keyword Planner here: Once you get into the planner, there are a couple options for you to choose. Go ahead and click on the first choice, “Search for new keywords using a phrase, website, or category.” You can then type in your information and keywords and hit “Get ideas.” We went and ahead and used the same term “dog” to keep things simple for you. Here are the results that popped up when we searched. These are the relevant LSI keywords that Google associates with the specific term. You’ll also be able to see how many searches are done during an average month, and how competitive the word or phrase is.

International SEO: 5 ways to scale performance LSI Keyword Generator This is another easy way to locate ideal LSI keywords. You can find this free keyword tool here. You simply need to enter your keyword into the search bar and it will generate a list of LSI keywords. Here’s what our search generated for the term “dog.” How do you know which of these keywords are the best? You now have a list of LSI keywords. But you can’t (and shouldn’t) use all of them. How do you know which are the most ideal for your website? The key is to understand why someone would be searching for this term. Once you have this information, you can decide which keywords apply to your situation. Often times the intent of a user’s search is to find out one of three things: Finding information on a subject (For example, what is a dog?) Finding specifics about a subject (Example: What are the most popular dog breeds?) Finding a way to purchase the subject (Example: Where can I find dogs to purchase?) To state the obvious, you’ll want to choose keywords that are applicable to your content. So, if your website is about dog adoption, you wouldn’t want to choose an LSI keyword relating to how to treat dog flu. You’d want to choose a keyword that’s more relevant to your website, such as “dogs for sale.” The team at HigherVisibility came up with a great LSI infographic for beginners that shows how this works and how to be successful with the strategy. LSI is a way to prevent the stuffing of keywords into a piece of content. The best way to incorporate these words into your website and content is to write them in naturally. Finding a combination of both popular keyword searches and relevance to your content is the ideal way to decide which of the keywords work for your website. The takeaway If you’re trying to rank your website high in search results, you’re willing to play the Google game. Including effective backlinks and adding keywords to your website’s content will rank you high and generate more traffic to your business’s website, but adding in latent semantic indexing and you may be thrown for a loop. Ultimately, it isn’t a difficult concept to understand. Just know that Google looks for synonyms to keywords to find the most appropriate content for a search query (and we’re glad they do!). Once you’ve understood how and where to find your ideal LSI keywords, you’re well on your way to boosting your SEO strategy. Do you have experience with LSI keywords?

It lets you track, analyze, or log just about anything you could imagine. What makes it even more powerful is the fact that you can use what are called Google Scripts to enhance the capabilities of this online tool. Something like “Google Scripts” sounds scary. You’re probably thinking that anything with the word “scripts” in it requires advanced programming knowledge. That actually isn’t the case. In this article I’m going to show you four fairly simple scripts that will let you customize your own functions (like a temperature conversion), auto-generate charts based on any data, customize your own menu inside of Google Sheets, and even automate the sending of monthly emails. All that in a single article? You bet! 1. Create Your Own Custom Functions One of the easiest ways creating a Google Script can greatly enhance your Google Sheets experience is by creating custom functions. Google Sheets already offers a long list of functions. You can see the most common ones by clicking on the Menu > Functions icon. Clicking on “More functions…” turns up a long list of math, statistical, financial, text, engineering, and many other functions. However, Google Scripts gives you the flexibility to create your very own personalized formulas. Advertisement For example, say you often import information from a digital thermostat at your job, but the thermostat is set for Celsius. You could create your own custom formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, so with one click and a drag of your mouse, you could automatically convert all of those imported values. To create your first custom function, first you’ll need to open up the script editor. To do this, click on Tools > Script Editor. You will likely see a screen like the one below, or something similar to it. What you’ll need to do is replace what’s in this Window with your own custom function. The function name is the same as the function that you’ll start typing into a cell in Google Sheets after the “=” symbol in order to invoke your formula. A function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit would look something like this: function CSTOFH (input) {
  return input * 1.8 + 32;
}
 Paste the function above into the code window, and then select File > Save, name the project something like “CelsiusConverter” and click OK. That’s all there is to it! Now, all you have to do to use your new function is type the “=” sign followed by your function, with the input number to convert: Press Enter and you’ll see the result. That’s all there is to it. Just imagine all of the cool custom functions you could quickly create now that you know this little trick! 2. Auto-Generate Charts In past articles, we’ve showed you how to do things like log data from your home Wi-Fi cameras to a Google spreadsheet Log Your Home Activity With Google Sheets and USB Cameras Log Your Home Activity With Google Sheets and USB Cameras If you have a USB camera and a computer, you already have everything you need to set up an inexpensive motion detection system. Read More , or maybe you’re using Google Sheets with a team 5 Google Sheets Settings Essential for Teamwork 5 Google Sheets Settings Essential for Teamwork Google Sheets has more features to support collective data input and processing than you may think. We'll introduce you to Google Sheets functions and features that are essential for group projects. Read More and other people are entering data for you. Eventually, you may have a new spreadsheet each month with new data, and you’d like to automatically create a new chart without having to manually recreate it every month. You can accomplish this by creating a function that will create a new chart for you, based on the data in the current spreadsheet you have open. First, in this scenario, let’s say you’re a teacher and at the end of the year, you have a spreadsheet for each student with the list of monthly exam scores: What you would like to do is run a single function on this sheet that would autogenerate a chart in seconds. Here is what that script looks like: function GradeChart() {
  var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var sheet = spreadsheet.getSheets()[0];

  var gradechart = sheet.newChart()
    .setChartType(Charts.ChartType.LINE)
    .addRange(sheet.getRange('A1:B11'))
    .setPosition(5, 5, 0, 0)
    .build();

  sheet.insertChart(gradechart);
} Now, all you have to do is open each of your student’s spreadsheets, and click on the run icon in the menu in Google Scripts to auto-generate the chart. Whenever you click on the run icon, it’ll run the script that you’ve created on the “active” spreadsheet (the one you have open in your current browser tab). For reports that you have to generate frequently, like weekly or monthly, this kind of auto-generated chart function can really save you a lot of time, as you don’t have to recreate the wheel every time you want to chart data on a new sheet. 3. Create Custom Menus What if you don’t want to have to have the script open to auto-generate that chart? What if you’d like the convenience of having that function right at your fingertips in the menu system, right inside of Google Sheets? Well, you can do that too. In order to create a custom menu, you need to tell the spreadsheet to add your new menu item every time it opens. You do this by creating an onOpen() function in the Script editor window above the Gradechart function you just created: function onOpen() {
  var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActive();
  var menuItems = [
    { name: 'Create Grade Chart...', functionName: 'GradeChart' }
  ];
  spreadsheet.addMenu('Charts', menuItems);
} Save the script, and then reload your spreadsheet. You’ll discover that now your new Menu item showed up with the name you defined it as in your script. Click on the menu and you’ll see the menu item for your function. Click on the menu item and it’ll run the function just like it did when you pressed the “run” icon from inside of the Google Scripts editor! 4. Send Automated Reports The final script worth covering here, since the idea is to add to the power and functionality of Google Sheets, is a script that will send email from inside of Google Sheets. The way this may come in handy is if you are managing a large team of people Delegation: A Must Have Leadership Skill to Reduce Your Workload Delegation: A Must Have Leadership Skill to Reduce Your Workload Once you're in a leadership role, you'll have to learn how to delegate work. We teach you the five Ws of delegation: the Who, What, When, Where, and Why. Read More and you have multiple emails to send on the same topic. Maybe you’ve done a performance review with individual team members, and logged your review comments for each person in a Google Spreadsheet. Would it be nice to just run a single script and have those comments automatically emailed out to the 50 or 60 employees all at the same time without you having to manually create all of those individual emails? That’s the power of Google Scripting. Similar to how you created the scripts above in this article, you’ll create a script by going into the script editor and creating a function called sendEmails(), like this: function sendEmails() {
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  var startRow = 2; // First row of data to process
  var numRows = 7; // Number of rows to process
  var dataRange = sheet.getRange(startRow, 1, numRows, 3)
  var data = dataRange.getValues();
  for (i in data) {
    var row = data[i];
    var emailAddress = row[1]; // Second column
    var message = row[2]; // Third column
    var subject = "My review notes";
    MailApp.sendEmail(emailAddress, subject, message);
  }
} So let’s say you have your spreadsheet organized as shown here. The script above will work all the way through each row in the spreadsheet, and send out an email to the address in the second column, with the message that you’ve typed into the third column. The sendEmail function in Google Scripts is by far one of the most powerful functions in Google Scripts, because it opens up a whole world of email automation that you might not have considered before. If you consider the fact that you could potentially have other people responsible for entering data into a Google spreadsheet for you, and then if you automate the distribution of emails based on that entered data, you could potentially do something like send a monthly report to your boss, without ever actually having to open up your email client yourself. The script can automatically do all the work for you! Automation Is the Secret to Success What all of these automation Google Scripts should show you is that with just a few simple lines of code, Google Scripts has the power to partially or fully automate Google Sheets. These automations can be set up to run on a schedule, or you can run them manually whenever you want to trigger them. Either way they provide you with a way to automate a lot of work, with very little effort. Have you ever used any of the functions described in this article to automate any of your own tasks? Do you know any other cool, simple scripts to simplify effort in Google Sheets? Share your ideas in the comments section below!

In San Francisco, the life Max Hawkins lived was arguably perfect. He was employed by Google, surrounded by friends and had his routine nailed down. He woke to artisanal coffee, biked to work along the beautiful Embarcadero waterfront roadway, lunched on Google's famed free food ("like four different kinds of kale" level) and — possibly the true mark of a successful millennial — got invited to many happy hours. But something was missing. Sometimes Max would lay awake at night pondering what felt so ... wrong. "I just started thinking about these loops that we get into," he says. "And about how the structure of your life ... completely determines what happens in it." Max's once beautiful routine suddenly seemed unfulfilling. He felt like he was growing closer to people in his own bubble and becoming isolated from those outside of it. "There was something ... that just made me feel trapped," he says. "Like I was reading a story that I'd read before or I was playing out someone else's script." As any computer developer would do, Max turned to technology to craft his way out — a series of randomization applications. Max started small, with an app that integrated Uber. It starts like a regular ride-hailing app: He would press a button in the app and a car would arrive. But then, a twist: He couldn't select a drop-off location; the app would choose a spot within a range without disclosing it. The only thing the rider had do was enjoy the journey — and hope for a good destination. From there, Max's applications became more complex. He built an app that used a Facebook search function for public events to find ones near him. Then the app would randomly choose which event Max would attend. At first, he was nervous: What if people wouldn't let him in? But, as a kind of unassuming white guy, he actually didn't have this problem. (And Max acknowledges this privilege.) Once Max explained how and why he had arrived at these events, hosts usually welcomed him, often with only a few questions asked. Most of the time, people were taken by the idea of Max expanding his bubble. One night, he got to drink white Russians with some Russians. Another, he attended acroyoga (as in, acrobatics + yoga). A community center pancake breakfast. A networking event for young professionals. The algorithm chose; Max attended. Most of these events were something that the nonrandomized Max would never have thought to try. The computer was breaking him out of a life driven by his own preferences. He was suddenly seeing the world in a whole new way, and he really liked it. "If I went out myself and said, like, 'I want to see the world!' I have an idea of what I need to see to do that," Max says. "But when I'm turning that over to a random algorithm, it has its own different idea. You're taking on the computer's view of the world, and because that's not human, it's likely to be completely different from your own." One year, Max decided to use the Facebook-event generator app to choose where he would celebrate Christmas. It came up with a party at someone's home in Fresno, Calif. With a pie and a friend, Max drove for three hours and showed up on the doorstep of a retired psychologist, Karena Beasley. Karena was celebrating with a handful of friends and family — and now, also two 20-something strangers. "She was completely not phased," Max says, describing the moment they met Karena. "She didn't miss a beat. She said, 'Oh, wonderful! We love Facebook, I'm so glad you're at the party. Welcome.' And it was like instantly we were friends." Max says he and his friend stayed at the party for five or six hours. In a video from the night, the group sings carols to guitar and Max looks as if he is right where he belongs. Max lived a randomized life for the better part of two years. In fact, he went global. He created an app that chose the places he would live, travel and eat. When he traveled, he continued using the Facebook events app to find random activities. Would the old Max have chosen to attend a socialists' rally in Berlin? Or a meetup for bloggers of central Iowa? Max's randomized travels sent him to Vietnam, Germany, India, United Arab Emirates, Slovenia. He met people whom he would have never encountered inside his own perfect prerandomization bubble. Max's app accounts for the costs of the globe-trotting style. "It knows about my budget," Max says — he can set price parameters. He freelances as a developer on the side. And, if he needs a break, he just turns the app off. The computer isn't entirely in charge, yet. In fact, these days, Max has silenced the app. He is taking time off and living in Los Angeles (by choice, not randomization) and finalizing his suite of randomization apps. He hopes to introduce them for public use in the upcoming months. He has also created a Facebook group that encourages people to attend strangers' publicly listed events and offers tips and tricks for doing so. He shares updates on his projects on his website. Maybe what Max is doing can be called art. And maybe it's a lifestyle that few would want to live. But one thing is for sure: His new bubble is fluid and ever-expanding, capturing new bubbles, other people's bubbles, and changing how he sees the world.

Creating Better, Faster And More Optimized WordPress Websites By Brian Jackson June 7th, 2017 PerformanceWordPress 10 Comments Consumers typically have their own experiences when it comes to web hosting and their own opinions. If you search Google for reviews for any web hosting provider you’ll find dozens of results. Usually, there are a lot more negative reviews than there are positive ones. I thought I would flip that around and share some WordPress hosting challenges from the perspective of the WordPress host and how I frequently solve them. I have compiled a list of bad web practices and recommendations on what not to do on your site, based on thousands of hours of customer interactions, support tickets, and troubleshooting I experience on a daily basis. Some of these range from beginner mistakes to more complex issues. A lot of these can be the difference between having a successful WordPress site and a failure. Picking the right web host is very important. But your decision also goes hand-in-hand with educating yourself on how to best optimize your WordPress site. 1 Optimizing WordPress sites. (Large preview2) I often observe that even seasoned developers focus on what they are good at, which is building solutions and sometimes neglect or don’t have time to learn the latest optimization practices. Whether you are a WordPress user just getting started or an experienced developer, the following tips will help you create better, faster and more optimized WordPress sites. Further Reading on SmashingMag: Link Free SSL For Any WordPress Website3 WordPress Responsive Images With Art Direction4 Lessons Learned From WordPress Plugin Support5 How To Make WordPress Hard For Clients To Mess Up6 1. Switching Hosts Isn’t Always a Quick Fix Link One of the most important things people need to realize is that switching hosts doesn’t automatically fix certain problems. If your WordPress site is having code issues or compatibility problems with specific plugins, this is still going to occur no matter where you host your site. 7 Coding issues aren’t magically fixed. (Large preview8) A managed host will provide as much assistance as they can, but won’t debug an issue with a bad plugin or code for you. It is not the WordPress host’s responsibility to write PHP code, create or edit custom functions for plugins or themes, integrate or fix external services or performing website content updates. This is where you would need the assistance of a seasoned WordPress developer to dig into it and make a determination as to what the issue is. There are many places to find WordPress specific developers, such as Codeable9 or toptal10. Many hosts also have third-party agency partners and developers they can refer you to for solving these problems. If there is an issue with a specific plugin, you should also reach out to the developer yourself. 2. Live Sites are Not For Development Work Link I could say this a thousand times. Never use production (live) sites for development work! Nearly all of the major managed WordPress hosts now have staging/development environments and this is certainly for good reason. It prevents critical downtime caused by users breaking things while testing on their live site. This is typically the scenario that causes what some call the white screen of death11. If you don’t want to use a staging environment you can always test and develop locally12 using what some call a LAMP or LEMP stack. These stand for Linux, Apache/Nginx (sounds like Engine-X), MySQL, and PHP. Tools like WAMP and MAMP13 all make configurations for local development quite easy. These tools have all improved and evolved over time, but there are also other challenges and problems that arise with local development, such as the environment not exactly mimicking your live site. First of all, you have to figure out how to push your changes from local back to production without overwriting existing data or breaking your site. Depending on your setup this process might even add another layer of complexity. Other complications could also include having to mess with conflicting ports or errors from a different version of MySQL are all things that could pop up. To avoid some of these complications, I recommend using tools like DesktopServer14 and Local15, which are both built solely for the purpose of speeding up your workflow when working locally with WordPress. These include streamlined ways to push things back to production and even have additional tools and features such as WP-CLI and multisite support built right in. Having multisite support alone can be priceless as working with large local installations can sometimes be downright tricky. 16 LEMP stack. (View large version17) Staging and local testing environments can help you find problems before they break your site. 3. Not A Developer? Don’t Edit Your Code Link People that are either unfamiliar with WordPress or don’t know the basics of how code works should not be editing files. One of the most common reasons that WordPress sites go down (or see that “white screen of death”) is someone editing a PHP file directly from the appearance editor in the dashboard. Also, you shouldn’t be editing your live site to begin with as we mentioned earlier. 18 Editing code in the WordPress Appearance editor. (View large version19) A good administrative recommendation is to place the following code in your wp-config.php file, removing the edit_themes, edit_plugins, and edit_files capabilities for all users. This can help prevent users from breaking the site by hacking away at the code. define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true); Taking this process one step further, remove the functionality for clients to update themes or install plugins. Place the following code in your wp-config.php file to restrict these capabilities. define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS', true); Note: The above code will also disable the plugin and theme file editor, so you don’t need both if you want to disable everything mentioned above. See WordPress Codex20 for more information. 4. Don’t Cut Corners on Your Themes and Plugins Link It’s understandable that you are trying to save a few bucks or cut corners, but don’t do it with your themes and plugins. WordPress might be the foundation of your site, but the themes and plugins are the glue that holds it all together. Try to stick with reputable developers when choosing plugins and look through the ratings and reviews beforehand. Look for a history of the developer providing good product support. With over 50,000 plugins in the repository21, this can sometimes be an overwhelming task, so do your research beforehand. 22 Finding a plugin in the WordPress repository. (Image credit: WordPress.org23) (View large version24) It is very common for outdated and bad themes/plugins to more easily get infected with malware, inject bad links on your site, pharma, etc. According to recently published research by WP Loop25, nearly 50% of the plugins in the repository haven’t been updated in over 2 years. That is both shocking and frightening! 26 Statistics on plugins that haven’t been updated. (Image credit: WP Loop27) (View large version28) Another thing to be on the lookout for is a third-party source that is bundling up premium plugins into one low bundled price. If you purchase these, first off, you aren’t supporting the developer, so shame on you. Second, you are relying on the 3rd party to grab the latest updates for you which is not good. Relying on updates for a bundled plugin is actually a huge problem for WordPress users who purchase things via online marketplaces such as ThemeForest. Many theme developers bundle additional plugins like Revolution Slider or Visual Composer. The problem is that when vulnerabilities are discovered29, the consumer is left waiting for an update from the theme developer, even though the plugin might have been patched the next day. This leaves a lot of sites wide open for hackers and site owners extremely vulnerable. 5. Watch Your Admin AJAX Calls Link Watch out for multiple Admin AJAX30 calls from your WordPress site and plugins that may utilize AJAX. For example, the WordPress Heartbeat API uses /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php to run AJAX calls from the web-browser. A lot of times these are un-cachable requests. High usage of this file sometimes occurs during traffic spikes, CPU load, and can bring your site to a crawl. It is almost like you are launching a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against yourself! 31 High admin-ajax.php usage. (Image credit: Pingdom625932) (View large version33) If there are 3rd party plugins that utilize admin-ajax.php, make certain they are doing it in the correct way. You can usually look at the HTTP POST request action and quickly determine, based on the name, what plugin might be causing it. For example, one I have seen is, get_shares_count. Which turned out to be a popular social media sharing plugin which was hammering admin-ajax.php. These simply multiply on high-traffic sites. However, AJAX does load after the page loads. So just because you see this in a speed test, doesn’t necessarily always mean it is a bad thing. It is also an interesting comparison to note the performance differences34 between admin-ajax.php and the WordPress REST API. 6. Be Smart With Ad Networks and Limit External Services Link Most high-traffic websites rely on advertising for their income. Removing 3rd party advertisements altogether is not an option. However, it is important to keep the number of 3rd party networks to a minimum and realize just how much load some of these tack onto your website. Here’s a quick comparison of how ad networks can affect your WordPress site. Test Parameters: I added three 300×250 Google Adsense ads on a development/staging site running the default twenty sixteen theme and tested the speed before and after. Before AdSense (test results35) Link First view: 1.372s load time Repeat view: 1.013s load time Here is the content breakdown by connections: 36 Content breakdown before running Google AdSense. (Image credit: WebPageTest37) (View large version38) After AdSense (test results39) Link First view: 4.103s load time Repeat view: 3.712s load time Here is the content breakdown by connections: 40 Content breakdown after adding Google AdSense. (Image credit: WebPageTest41) (View large version42) By simply adding 3 Google AdSense ads, 6 additional connections were instantly added. The WordPress site with ads is 2.7x slower than the one without. This is mainly due to extra DNS lookup times and much heavier use of JavaScript on the page. This gives you a small picture of what can happen when large-scale sites simply embeds 10 ads on a single page. No matter how fast your WordPress host is, it won’t fix delays from 3rd party ad network connections. Here is another example below taken from New Relic monitoring on a site with a massive amount of HTTP requests to external ad networks, causing a heavy load on the WordPress site. 43 Heavy load due to advertising network. (View large version44) There were so many requests that the app server failed to load at all. The site was simply unavailable trying to load all the external requests. 45 Web transactions time on app server. (View large version46) Another good example of this is with Huffington Post’s47 website. If you run a speed test on their website you will see massive amounts of HTTP requests to ad networks. This graph shows what I saw in a quick test. (speed test48). They had a load time of over 13 seconds! First view: 15.908s load time / Total HTTP requests: 221 Repeat view: 13.957s load time / Total HTTP requests: 66 However, simply removing advertisements might not be a realistic solution. Many sites rely on them for their income and livelihood. In this case, it’s important to dive deeper into your scripts and ensure they are loading in the most optimal way. You can use async49 or defer on your scripts to help prevent them from interrupting the rendering of your page loads. When it comes to performance there is always a balancing act of perceived performance50 vs. that of actual performance. Async JavaScript example: Link src="example.js" async Defer JavaScript example: Link src="example.js" defer Patrick Sexton also has another popular method for deferring JavaScript51. WordPress version 4.1 and higher has a filter52 in which you can more easily add async and defer attributes to your scripts. As a general rule, if you are relying on external services you will also want to cache the responses. Why? Because issues like the white screen of death can occur if you don’t. Every external service you add to your WordPress site should be from a trusted and reliable source. After all, if they go down, it is then affecting your entire site or business operations. If you use vanity URLs generated from your WordPress site and use them in social networks, those will cease to function as well. 7. Over Optimizing Can Hurt Your Performance Link There are thousands of articles around the web that give “tips” on how to speed up and optimize your WordPress site. But an even worse scenario is when users over optimize their websites. Yes, this happens a lot more frequently than you might think. It is common for WordPress site owners to think that by adding more of something it will double their speed. Below I’ve listed a few problem scenarios that I see on a regular basis: Trying to Cache the Cache Link Unlike typical VPS or standalone servers, a lot of managed WordPress host providers have their own caching, which is done at a server-level (like Redis or Memcache). Most providers do not allow caching plugins because this can cause all types of issues, most commonly 502 gateway errors. Trying to “cache the cache” as I call it is never a good idea. 53 Bad optimizations which makes things worse. (View large version54) Plugins like WP Rocket and Cache Enabler are great, but they are designed for servers which need additional assistance speeding up your site. Read more about object caching55, which is a popular form of server-level caching used by many today. Adding 2 CDNs = is 2x the Speed, Right? Link Content Delivery Networks56 (CDN) have been shown to greatly decrease load times and latency when serving up content across different geographical regions, but only when setup correctly. One of the most popular providers is Cloudflare. Cloudflare is technically a fully proxy service and is slightly different than a normal CDN provider as you are pointing your entire DNS over to them, not just your assets. Typically I see users add CloudFlare, and then they go add KeyCDN or MaxCDN along with it. This is usually because they read blog posts from someone recommending that they should go install this new service right away, and they simply go do it. They don’t think about their existing setup. While this combination can work in certain scenarios, typically this ends up in a giant mess. In most cases it is better to either use CloudFlare or use a 3rd party CDN provider, each of which have their own advantages and disadvantages. More SEO Plugins Doesn’t Mean You Will Dominate SERPs Link You want to dominate search engine ranking positions (SERPs) right? Well, adding 3 SEO plugins won’t help you accomplish that goal. In fact, there are a lot of compatibility issues that popup when trying to run All In One SEO, Yoast, and other SEO plugins together. Such as outputting duplicate meta tags57. Adding more plugins doesn’t mean it will improve your current SEO situation. 8. Common Performance Issues are Easy to Diagnose Link Even if you aren’t an advanced WordPress expert, common performance issues are fairly easy to diagnose. I recommend using WebPageTest58 for seasoned WordPress users as it supports the latest protocols such as HTTP/2. However, for those that aren’t as webperf savvy, then Pingdom625932 does a good job. A simple waterfall analysis60 can tell you quite a bit, such as learning if you have unnecessary redirects, missing files, too many DNS lookups or if a certain script or 3rd party ad network is bogging your site down. Take a quick glance at the performance insights and response codes and you can see where to start addressing these performance issues on your WordPress site. 61 Pingdom performance insights. (Image credit: Pingdom625932) (View large version63) 9. Modifying WordPress Core is Bad Link Plain and simple, modifying WordPress core files to make some of your code work is simply a bad idea64, especially on a live production site. Doing this can open up your WordPress site to security vulnerabilities. Unless you have an active update procedure in place (which many don’t) you will lose your modifications with each new version of WordPress that is released. Instead, you should take advantage of WordPress tools and features such as well-developed 3rd party plugins, child themes, custom post types and hooks. 10. Ensure PHP 7/HHVM Compatibility Before Jumping on Board Link PHP 7 and HHVM have been shown to be incredibly fast when it comes to boosting WordPress performance65. And of course it’s always satisfying to be using the latest and greatest, but first you need to make sure your site is compatible before simply hopping on the bandwagon. For example, If you are upgrading from PHP 5.6 to 7, you should test all functionalities of your WordPress site in a staging environment or locally to ensure there aren’t any compatibility issues. One out of date plugin you rely on that doesn’t work with PHP 7 could mean that you should wait before moving. 11. Large Sites Should Optimize Their Database Link One of the easiest ways for a large WordPress site to slow down is when the database hasn’t been optimized. Simple tasks like cleaning up old WordPress revisions or cleaning up unused tables, can help prevent some of this slowdown. However, I’ve found that a lot of older sites are still using the MyISAM storage engine in their database. Recently InnoDB has shown to perform better66 and be more reliable. A big reason is to use InnoDB over MyISAM is the lack of table locking. This allows your queries to process faster. 67 Database performance. (View large version68) You can convert your tables with just a few simple steps. Ensure you are running MySQL 5.6.4 or higher and that you always take a backup as a precautionary measure before making changes to your database. This example is using the wp_comments table. Simply run the ALTER command to convert it to InnoDB storage engine. ALTER TABLE wp_comments ENGINE=InnoDB; If you are running on a newer version of phpMyAdmin you can also click on a table, click into the “Operations” tab and change the storage engine manually. 69 Changing from MyISAM to InnoDB. (View large version70) Another easy optimization technique is to disable or modify the number of revisions you keep in your database. You can add the following to your wp-config.php to disable them completely. define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', false ); Or simply modify the number of revisions that are kept per post/page: define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', 3); I’ve seen many sites with over 200 revisions per post, which adds up very fast across large sites. Unless your host has an internal optimization in place, the default in WordPress is to store unlimited revisions. This is why it’s so important to check and verify the settings with your own eyes. If your current site has a lot of revisions already, you can run the following query in phpMyAdmin to clean them up: DELETE FROM wp_posts WHERE post_type = "revision"; If you aren’t comfortable running a query, use plugins such as WP-Optimize to help you cleanup the revisions. 12. Do You Really Need a Multipurpose Theme? Link There is a huge problem I see within the WordPress community. People go out and buy a multipurpose theme and then only utilize 1% of the theme’s features or none at all. Many see fancy sliders and attractive portfolio pages on the demos that entices them to make the purchase. But in reality, these might be things they never actually use. They could have purchased a more minimal theme and saved a ton of time on digging through confusing options and their site would be a lot faster from the onset. Many of these additional features add load time. I’m not saying all multipurpose themes are bad, in fact with a lot of customization they can sometimes run fast. Here is an example of an Avada theme that clocks in under 700ms. (speed test71) 72 Optimized multipurpose WordPress theme. (Image credit: Pingdom73) (View large version74) However, that requires a lot of knowledge and time to optimize the existing theme. For basic WordPress users, if they aren’t utilizing a lot of features a more minimal theme is the way to go. Don’t let all the shiny bells and whistles fool you. In most scenarios, fancy sliders and visual editors just slow your site down. 13. Error Log Is Your Friend Link If you know your way around your WordPress files and the wp-config.php file, then the error log is your friend. By checking it on a regular basis you can save yourself a lot of headaches and probably learn a thing too. Not many users even bother checking this before reaching out to their host for help. With a few simple tweaks in your wp-config.php file you can enable logging, which by default is saved to /wp-content/debug.log. 75 Error log is your friend. (View large version76) Enable Logging Link define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true ); Output Logging on Page Link define( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', true ); See more information in the WP_DEBUG codex.77 14. Google is Here for a Reason Link You would think this is common sense by now, but Google is here for a reason folks. Don’t be afraid to Google your answer. The internet is full of solutions and tips. Within a few minutes of searching you can easily solve a majority of your issues. Typically questions like “how to change your GoDaddy DNS” or “how to use SFTP” are things that can be easily found on Google. There are great resources available online such as http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/78 and the WordPress Codex79. Not to mention the hundreds of blogs with tutorials on just about any WordPress scenario that exists. But not all of this is squarely on the shoulders of the user either. A responsible WordPress host should have an in-depth knowledge base with a good UI. Not only to cut down on their own support tickets but to help the user as well. 15. 123456 Is No Longer Acceptable Link SpashData compiles a list of the most widely used leaked passwords (over 2 million) every year. Not surprisingly, in 2015 the most popular password80 still being used was “123456 (the same as 2014).” This can be very frustrating for web hosting providers, as the bad practice of using easy to guess passwords puts the client’s WordPress site in a state of “always one step away from being hacked.” While storing passwords locally in a tool like KeePass is probably one of the safest routes, encouraging users to use services like LastPass or Passpack will at least help harden their passwords, even if they are stored in the cloud. A hashed and secured password in the cloud is always much more secure than using “123456.” 16. Scripts Don’t Always Need to Load Sitewide Link Unfortunately, unlike a static website which you have more control over, when it comes to WordPress many are at the mercy of the plugin and theme developers. Let’s be honest, not all developers care about performance. There are a lot of plugins that simply load their scripts on all pages even though it might only be used on one. If you multiply this by 35+ plugins you can end up with a lot of unnecessary bloat that slows down your site. One example of this can be seen with the popular Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin. As shown below, it is loading it’s CSS file on the homepage of our dev site, as well as it’s JavaScript file. Even though I’m not utilizing any contact form. 81 Script loading sitewide. (View large version82) There are a few easy ways to get around this. The first is to utilize a function which was introduced in WordPress 3.1 called wp_dequeue_script()83. This allows you to remove an enqueued script from your site. Here is an example of how to utilize the function84 with Contact Form 7. The Contact Form 7 developer also has some documentation on how to load the JavaScript and CSS only when necessary85. Another easy way to prevent certain scripts from loading on specific pages and posts is to utilize a WordPress plugin like Gonzalez86 or Plugin Organizer87. Here is an example below on our dev site with the Gonzalez plugin. There are easy one-click options to disable the Contact Form 7 CSS and JavaScript files sitewide, per page/post, or only enable in a specific place. Generally, only loading Contact Form 7 on your “Contact Us” page would be the best for performance. 88 Disable scripts per page. (View large version89) Conclusion Link There is a reason why WordPress is used by over 28% of all websites90 on the internet. And that is because it’s a very robust, easy to use and feature rich content management system (CMS). Everyone from stay at home bloggers to fortune 500 companies rely on it every day. Just like with most platforms, if it isn’t properly used or optimized it can turn into a big headache very quickly. By correcting some of the common issues and mistakes I’ve seen from WordPress users above you can ensure happier visitors, better conversion rates, lower bounce rate and even improved search engine rankings.

Had lots of different topics to think about. Just one part was a little frustrating and that was the tips were so broad and uneven it was a little hard to read. To me this was aimed at junior developers so I’m not sure if this format would be the best for them. Going from php7 to dev environment, to plugins, to code editing to weak passwords, then to suggest using google all seemed a little bit of a mishmash. Reply 1 2 Brian Jackson June 9, 2017 3:04 am Hey Marc! Thanks for the comment. I definitely agree each topic needs more detail, but I would need another 16 posts for that :) The goal was really to give a good overview of some common mistakes and act as a reminder that these are issues we shouldn’t ignore, as these are what lead to long page load times. Even developers have a lot of bad habits when it comes to performance. Reply 0 3 Matt Rittman June 7, 2017 3:02 pm Thanks so much for the writing this article! Lot’s of useful information here. Especially the bit about scripts loading sitewide… found some plugins on my site that don’t need to load on every page. Thanks again! Reply 2 4 Brian Jackson June 9, 2017 2:58 am Great, glad it was helpful! You would be surprised how much disabling certain scripts can do for your site. I have personally seen homepages go from 2 second loads times to under 800ms just be ensuring only things that need to load are loading. This is especially important on multipurpose themes.

Thanks for the article. Reply 2 7 Sajal June 8, 2017 3:41 am Thanks for such a great article with lots of information. It will help WordPress community to achieve their goals. Reply 1 8 Muhammad Saqib Sarwar June 8, 2017 10:16 am Brian, Thanks for this informative article. I am concerned about your point related to logging. As I believe file operations like writing to a log file takes server resources and slows down request processing. So it is not recommended to enable it on production site. It can be enabled temporarily to diagnose a certain problem but not more than that. Although it is fine to keep it enabled permanently On development and staging installations. Reply 2 9 Chancey June 9, 2017 12:34 am Wring to log file takes extremely small amounts of resources even on extremely large sites. The exception to this comes with website statistics such as awstats which can cause momentary spikes once per 24 hours when data and graphs are compiled. Normal logging such as error and access should not be disabled and has no impact on performance. Reply 1 10 Chancey June 9, 2017 12:31 am KISS is still king, speed and security are not complicated. 1. Use PHP 7 2. Go with a host that offers Opcode caching 3. Go with a host that offers webserver level page caching (Lscache, Varnish). 4. Use a host that has a server response time of under 400ms 5. Use a host that utilizes Litespeed. Some will argue on this point but it is a fact that Litespeed is faster under load by far then Apache and faster then Nginx both with http and https. 6.Use minimal plugins and make sure your pages are under 1MB 7. Ignore all the people that tell you to just get a VPS, you will just endup with lost data and or hacked. 8. Pick a host from > https://roastahost.com/top-5-best-wordpress-hosts/ (no ads, no affiliate crap, just proven numbers) 8 easy steps to a faster and stress free site.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Large-Cap Stocks for June Not only are these already very big companies, but two are at their all-time highs. We still think they're worth buying now. Keep reading to learn why that's the case. Jason Hall, Steve Symington, and Brian Feroldi (TMFVelvetHammer) Jun 8, 2017 at 9:44AM Large-cap stocks are the companies that made it big -- sometimes by disrupting the "old way" of doing things, and other times by creating a brand new industry. Often, these big companies offer investors a certain amount of stability, and sometimes as the cost of much growth. However, that's not always the case, and sometimes big companies can have big growth prospects, too.  With that in mind, we asked three of our top contributors for large-cap stocks to buy in June, and they offered up biotech giant Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG), Google parent company Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), and credit card and electronic payments processing giant MasterCard Inc. (NYSE:MA).  Image source: Getty Images. Keep reading to learn more about why these three large-cap stocks are ideal targets to buy this month.  All the pieces are in place Brian Feroldi (Celgene): The biotechnology sector has scores of companies that are long on growth potential but short on actual revenue and profits. That makes it difficult for investors to separate the winners from the losers. But biotech giant Celgene offers potential shareholders both near- and long-term growth potential, which makes it a great stock for new biotech investors to start with. Celgene's profit engine is currently powered by Revlimid, a blockbuster treatment for multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. Revlimid's sales exceeded $1.9 billion last quarter, which makes it one of the best-selling drugs in the world. Sales of Revlimid are still growing at double-digit rates year over year and should continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Beyond Revlimid, Celgene also boasts a number of other fast-growing drugs. That includes another blood cancer drug, called Pomalyst/Imnovid, and the plaque psoriasis medicine Otezla, among others. When combined with Revlimid, these drugs allow Celgene to crank out huge amounts of profits each and every quarter. Celgene's management is quite skilled at putting those profits to work for investors. The company has a long history of using its excess capital to fund new drug development, strike up collaborations with other companies, make acquisitions, and buy back huge amounts of stock. These moves provide management with so much confidence in the company's business prospects that it's gone on record multiple times to predict double-digit revenue and profit growth annually between now and 2021. That's not something that many other $90 billion businesses can claim. With shares currently trading around 13 times forward earnings, Celgene is an excellent large-cap stock for investors to consider scooping up today. "J" is for jaw-dropping growth Steve Symington (Alphabet): Shares of Google parent Alphabet are on a tear, up more than 26% so far in 2017 as of this writing -- and with good reason. Alphabet continues to drive stellar top- and bottom-line growth even from its enormous base. Revenue last quarter alone climbed 24% at constant currency to $24.75 billion, operating income increased 23% to $6.57 billion, and net income rose 29%, to $5.43 billion. For that, investors can primarily thank Alphabet's thriving advertising business at Google; ad revenue climbed 18.8% last quarter to just over $21.4 billion, helped by a 44% increase in aggregate paid clicks. And Google's non-advertising products (think Google Play, hardware, and cloud solutions) fared even better, with revenue rising more than 49% to just under $3.1 billion.  If that wasn't enough, Alphabet achieved its bottom-line growth despite absorbing an $855 million operating loss last quarter from its "other bets" segment, which is primarily composed of high-potential businesses still operating in their respective pre-revenue stages. To be fair, other-bets revenue did climb nearly 50% last quarter to $244 million, driven mostly by Alphabet's Nest connected-home products, Verily life-sciences products, and Fiber high-speed internet. As these other businesses continue to scale into eventual sustained profitability, it will only serve to reinforce Alphabet's tech industry leadership over the long haul. With shares still trading below 25 times this year's expected earnings -- a perfectly acceptable premium, given Alphabet's superior growth -- I think this large-cap winner will keep winning for patient investors going forward. Follow the money and you'll probably find this company Jason Hall (MasterCard Inc.): It's not very often that I suggest it's a good idea to buy a stock that's trading at all-time highs, but the long-term opportunity with MasterCard is simply too good for investors to ignore.  On a global basis, electronic payments make up a small fraction of transactions. But the world is becoming more wealthy, with the total middle-class population on track to add more than a billion new members in less than 20 years. At the same time, the world is also becoming more connected, with mobile computing putting the capability for electronic payments into more and more people's hands every day.  And while there will undoubtedly be competition, global giants such as MasterCard and its peers have a huge head start in ways that really matter: deep relationships with hundreds of thousands of merchants and financial institutions who count on their ability to securely and quickly move money from the customer to the merchant.  Since going public in 2003, MasterCard has increased its revenue 367% and grown its profits more than 3,000%. Going forward, management expects revenue will grow at less than double-digit rates, but its scale and operating leverage will generate steady double-digit earnings growth from that moderate revenue increase. Chances are, the company will use much of that earnings growth to pump up the dividend. It only yields 0.65% at recent prices, but with a payout ratio less than 23% of last year's earnings and expectations for years of steady double-digit profit growth, MasterCard is positioned to be an amazing dividend growth stock for long-term investors.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Users have started noticing subway station layouts for several subway stations in New York City, as well as some in Japan. The feature seems to be hit or miss for subway stations in other areas, as well as depending on whether you’re on desktop or mobile. There doesn’t appear to be much detail outside of the general layout of platforms and the outline of the overall structures and entrances, so any internal details — like the location of stairs, escalators, ticket machines, and the like — still requires your attention when you get to the actual subway station. Google has yet to make any formal announcement about this change, but we’ll share more details as we find them. Search your local stations to see if the feature is live for them. Make sure you’re in transit view, otherwise it may not show.

Google wants to make it easy for carriers to have interoperable RCS messaging Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/06/07 2:18pm PDTJun 7, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 174 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares261 Carriers Google News Last week Sprint and Rogers announced that users sending messages between the two carriers will be able to make use of RCS. RCS, of course, is the new standard to replace SMS that Google committed to back in 2015. So far each carrier seems to have its own idea for how RCS should work. But Google's recent work in cross-carrier communication is a big step towards ubiquity, and thanks to the tech behind this latest interconnect other carriers can more easily get in on the RCS action. We are deploying a "hub" model, so that carriers can interconnect to the hub once to get access to all other carriers connected to the hub. — Nick Fox (@RealNickFox) June 5, 2017 Google's Nick Fox followed up his announcement on the 1st with an answer to a question posed by our own Artem about how Google's RCS interconnect works. Instead of requiring that carriers individually connect their networks in some capacity to one another to exchange RCS messages, the RCS standards used by Google and the GSMA make use of a hub-style interconnect. Google's hub-based implementation of RCS in the recent cross-carrier announcement isn't a new technology, but it is cool. Back in 2013, the GSM Association published a white paper that detailed how RCS could work — and it's very much worth a read if you are even mildly interested in the future of carrier messaging, RCS, or even just networking. The white paper showed a few different methods for RCS implementation, such as using a direct NNI (Network-Network Interface) decentralized network for each carrier interconnection. Unfortunately, that particular solution results in a quickly rising number of interconnects as the number of carriers increases (n(n - 1) / 2), which means for each additional carrier in the network a larger investment needs to be made by those in it. The white paper also talked about a hub model for RCS, which has clear advantages for carriers. Rather than be burdened with developing their own connections to other carriers, each needs only connect to the one central hub presumably provided by Google. But, this centralized system will likely suffer from the same sort of weaknesses that all centralized systems do. For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. A central network is also more susceptible to censorship, attacks, or interference. However, it also provides some advantages, such as decreasing the investment of time and resources for carriers joining the standard. 4 node interconnect vs 36 The hub system proposed in the white paper (based on Openmind Networks implementation for SMS/MMS) does have drawbacks, but fewer connections might end up meaning faster deployment. And since Google has already done the work bringing the hub network up for Sprint and Rogers, each additional carrier should only responsible for its connection to that hub, as opposed to managing every link to every other RCS carrier themselves. Perhaps the recent news might help other carriers be persuaded to adopt Google's version of RCS, if for no other reason than cost-cutting. Why manage a ton of different networks for RCS when they can let Google cough up the cash for infrastructure? After all, if there's one thing carriers love, it's money.

Release 2 of the RCS universal profile which is to contain the needed information for third-party apps (Like Textra) to utilize RCS features will be released very soon. http://i.imgur.com/HLbSwcy.jpg https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ns9oV0Dh8_S5M-JHDvJ8sNHR6rpbiq2N6qZlP3g9zQ/edit Ryne Hager The beauty of that document makes me feel bad about my Google Docs skills. Jayson Stephenson Trust me, it wasn't anywhere that great to begin with. I really learned a lot with this doc and the amazing features/flexibility that G-Drive has. Snowsky Mountain Does this mean I can use third-party apps like the SMS Backup & Restore app to backup and restore RCS messages? Jayson Stephenson Yes, but even better. RCS Messages are by default synced to your carriers cloud infrastructure. So if you were to change phones/tablets your messages will be in sync with whatever device you use. Snowsky Mountain Where would I go to turn off/on that syncing of messages? Would it be from a messaging app, like the Android Messages app? Or would it be through my carrier? Also, I wonder what (if any) effect that would have on T-Mobile's DIGITS service, which appears to do something similar for SMS/MMS messages... Jayson Stephenson I'm not 100% yet. But I believe your answer might be on what Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en MJ I have no interest in my carrier storing my messages. No thanks... I hope this can be turned off. Jayson Stephenson I'm sure a lot of people will agree with you. As I mentioned to Snowsky, I believe the option for that will be on whatever Google turns its new 'Carrier Services' app into. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&hl=en Latheryin There goes your privacy. Dmitri Smirnov There was never any to begin with in the SMS world. Latheryin That completely is a matter of the country to live in. Dmitri Smirnov SS7 vulnerabilities prove, that lack of privacy transcends borders :) Also, there is nothing preventing your carrier to store the SMS "for technical reasons" regardless of a country. At any rate, while RCS might be a weird attempt to catch up with the messenger market, it is definitely not worse than the SMS. Latheryin Acutally there is. At least in the states. There are laws that prevent them from being more then a pass through. As for the messaging market. That also depends on the country you live in. Data messengers are bigger in developing countries then they are say in the states. A perfect example is that 3% of the US population even use a messaging app as their primary. SMS or just flat out calling is the preffered. David Ruddock Cool doc, but Verizon and AT&T are both signatories on the RCS Universal Profile. That doesn't compel them to do anything, but it seems unlikely they'd sign if they didn't intend to be compatible with the universal profile at some point, which is what Google Jibe is based on. Jayson Stephenson It doesn't say anywhere they they ever will implement it. In fact I expect they won't for a long time. All it mentions is their RCS is a proprietary format meaning it will work on only their internal networks. Also check out my comment on AT&T. newtonfb ATT showed a demo of it at MWC(I see that you made that comment on the doc, you should include the twitter picture also). I dont see why ATT and Tmobile will not have the UP out by the end of the year. Verizon is a different story as they have not showed or said anything about it. Jayson Stephenson The doc is open source. ;) Latheryin Yes attached showed it but it plans on placing it on top of their SMS setup not as a replacement. wicketr I think what he's saying is that "yes, it's proprietary now, but they planning on having UP with an unconfirmed launch date". The same is true for most of these. T-Mobile's is currently proprietary, but has been rumored to be UP completed by the end of the year. But it's undetermined if it's going to use Google's hub, or implement the RCS UP using Samsung's infratructure across the boards. Jayson Stephenson Yes, sorry for the confusion. I will see if I can design it any better. But so far the only carrier which we know guaranteed is in the process of installing the UP is T-Mobile. Which is mentioned in the doc. Tom Erlandsen Calling it now, I bet Allo gets RCS support fairly soon after this release Joshua Why? Android Messages - which has RCS - is made by Google. They could have implemented RCS into Allo this whole time. Tom Erlandsen Because Google wants Allo to succeed, and the absolute best way they can do that is by having some kind of carrier messaging fallback. They're not going to do SMS fallback, the Allo lead has come out and said that before. But they've never said they won't do RCS fallback. And the fact that Android Messages has RCS support means absolutely nothing. Google is infamous for its A/B tests, so it's hardly a stretch to imagine them having two apps with RCS support. If Allo with RCS fallback proves very popular and successful, I could imagine them discontinuing Android Messages and making Allo with RCS the default messaging app on Android, requiring OEMs to bundle it with their devices. But I only think they'll do that if Allo proves to be a success, as otherwise they'll face massive OEM backlash Joshua They wont discontinue Android Messages because here in Canada where RCS has been out for months, carriers have said in 2018 Android Messages is shipping with all of their devices. Tom Erlandsen Like I said, I don't think they'd discontinue Android Messages unless Allo was poised to take its place (i.e. had a decent userbase). And that would take a while to happen, even with RCS support. So yeah Android Messages will probably stay for a while, until Google has something it feels would make a better replacement, and I think that's what they'll try and build Allo into Jayson Stephenson You have a very similar theory as I do. I think the point of the renaming of Google Messages to "Android Messages" is to give all AOSP devices a baseline messenger app that is not branded with the Google name, and supports whatever standard your carrier utilizes. (SMS/MMS/RCS) Obviously Allo will not be getting full-SMS support at all for obvious reasons....(https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/53uvvu/why_sms_fallback_isnt_the_holy_grail_you_all/) But it might be possible for it to get RCS support and still allowing it to view, send, and receive SMS messages. As SMS messages are connected to your carriers data infrastructure instead of tied to your phone storage. (If you have an RCS compatible carrier) You can have Allo to communicate to any non-Allo contacts while still utilizing its rich features with Allo-Allo communication. Although I'm not sure if such an app/feature is even possible. If it were, we could see a messenger revolution! Abraham No this is how I see it. Android Messages is a very generic simple SMS/RCS platform. No real branding, no real benefit for Google. This makes carriers happy as they are not shoving Google on everyones faces by default. Allo, if it gets RCS support. Will be the Google branded, with Google assistant and many more things. But this will be for the user to decide if they want to use. Not set as default to keep the user and carriers happy. What do you guys think? Joshua More likely. Allo will never replace Android Messages. Android Messages is a very lightweight, clean, and basic app. Allo is full of many (some might call pointless) features most don't want or need. Allo is slow to open compared to Android Messages, which could get annoying if you just want to send a quick SMS/RCS message. McStagger are you keeping that spreadsheet updated? Jayson Stephenson Most certainly! .w oh, and google will be in the center of our communication even more! and if someone opts to use basic sms, which doesn't use internet and such one will end up being processed but damn google... how "noble" of them, and they will probably do this also for "free" (i.e. "only" our data will be collected)... 😆😄 Better Google than Amazon, Facebook, or Apple. That's for sure. .w I'm not so sure about that, given google cluster-freck attitude towards messaging apps... None of the above looks great tbh... Nana Adu-Krow Not sure what is so hard to understand about their messaging apps. Each one serves a different purpose. And if you feel like there's apps that lack certain functionality (like web app support or something) you have the option to use something 3rd party. .w ROTFL, I didn't say that it's hard to understand but the purpose of messaging app is, well... messaging. In case of google you have abundance of messaging apps and if they have distinctive functionality it's even worse - there should be single app that handles all the basics and does it well. That's not the case in google messaging ecosystem. Why would I put my feet in that mess? Just to find out that in a couple of months google would introduce yet another messaging app? or in case of operators - say that they were mistaken if not 100% chooses their solution. Bottomline - trusting google services, especially those not well established (like mail, calendar, docs or android ecosystem) is veeeery risky... Cakefish When will RCS come to the UK? NathanDrago My knowledge is that SMS have basically disappeared. I only receive SMS from my bank and my carrier. Everybody is using WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it. What's the purpose of this effort for RCS? Is RCS more capable than WhatsApp / Telegram / you name it? David Ruddock SMS is still widely used in the USA. NathanDrago But don't you suspect that by the time this standard even starts to spread, USA will already have caught up with the rest of the world (that is, abandoning non-data messages)? It seems to me a lot of wasted resources. raddacle Considering how comfortable people are with services like iMessage which discriminates against other OS's, I don't see SMS going anywhere for the US. SMS is as standard as possible for the US right now. The only way to change the standard is by forcing it, hence RCS. Santos Chavez iMessage says nope, sorry. iPhones are actually a lot more popular here in the USA than the rest of the world. Hence people never switch to other apps.Hence those iPhone users messaging an Android user and oops, it's an SMS now because, yeah, Android doesn't have iMessage. The Android user also wouldn't change apps either if their current SMS app allows them to chat with all of their iPhone using friends. Like me, for instance, I'm the only one in my group of 5 friends that uses an Android phone. Hence, my default SMS app, Android Messages,is all I need to talk with them. They don't switch apps because amongst themselves they use iMessage which is enough as they get advanced messaging features. See what I mean? RCS would at the very least make Android---> Android users have those same advanced messaging features they'd get with other apps. Pushing RCS as the standard works for us here because we've never switched out of using SMS apps. .w This highly depends on the country... Peter Obligatory XKCD https://m.xkcd.com/927/ Dat Nguyen Here in Belgium, SMS is still used (well less than before) because when it comes to mobile subscriptions, Belgium is one of the countries that has expensive prices. For example, for 15€ a month, the carrier I use gives you 2,5 hours of calling, unlimited texting and 1,5 Gb of data so it's not like I can enable the data 24/7 And none of the carriers in Belgium doesn't seem to be aware of RCS AbdulB1 keep it on 3g. You will survive within limits Ryne Hager RCS is supposed to be an open replacement for SMS/MMS. But it is really just another competing standard. At least when compared to things like WhatsApp it isn't a private system. Any carrier that wants to can jump on and start using RCS for messaging, while WhatsApp is not so open and requires that you use their app the way they want you to. So TL:DR RCS is just supposed to replace old standards. bekifft Obligatory XKCD: https://xkcd.com/927/ Latheryin Data only messaging services are not really used a lot in the states and many other places. Data rates are just too high where SMS is unlimited free. Kyle Salewski Really hoping that since Google is behind this, and with the recent revamp of Google Voice, that RCS would soon come to GV. Anyone have any insight on the complexity behind that? Or would it be really difficult since Google Voice isn't a traditional "carrier" but more of a middle man. David Ruddock It would make sense as a reason for them bringing it back from the brink of death, if nothing else. bekifft But Google Voice / Hangouts are the core of the Frankenstein monster that is Google Fi. They seem to be trying to kill both brands, so it makes more sense to do this as part of Google Fi. But maybe GV / GFi is just more A / B testing. Willie Chalmers III More like A/B/C/D/E testing for a messaging strategy. Santos Chavez I think Nick Fox also mentioned on Twitter that they're working on bringing RCS to Project Fi. Project Fi uses Google Voice as the back end for most of its functions so perhaps adding RCS to Voice is pretty much necessary for it to come to Fi-- maybe they'll "talk" to the same server, as such. Project Fi numbers are Google Voice numbers after all, technically. Snowsky Mountain Is an Internet connection required to send and receive RCS messages? Jay Yes. h4rr4r So then why bother with it over XMPP? Snowsky Mountain So what would happen if I had a cellular connection but no Internet (no Wi-Fi or data)? Would it fall back to SMS/MMS? Jay Yep, you got it! John Doe VoLTE? Phone service requires Internet now so why not messages? Evan Anderson For instance, if the capacity of the hub isn't high enough for the traffic present, then messages might not be delivered as expected, or things could grind to a halt. This is an extremely unlikely situation. Any large network system, such as this one, will have plenty of redundancy and excess capacity to avoid ever overloading the system. Star network topology is standard these days, so this architecture makes perfect sense. Any other topology is highly inefficient. Snowsky Mountain I wonder what would happen if that were to occur, though. Maybe it would fall back to SMS/MMS? Ryne Hager It's definitely unlikely, I'm more concerned about denial of service implications from a centralized system. Decentralized might be more expensive for the carriers, but it would be more robust. Houston Texas Robust how? Borgman Say Android Messages gets RCS on all carriers and stuff. What then will be the incentive to use Allo or other IM? Sruly J Well Allo has bots... Marcellus1 It'll be the particular feature set of each offering. I could use Allo because I like the bot and you could use WhatsApp because you like the stickers, for example, but it wouldn't matter that we aren't using the same app--which would be awesome and would drive competition better. Borgman But Allo won't get RCS, correct? Won't that remain an IM (unfortunately?). Or by some miracle (thanks to RCS) I'd be able to use Allo and message someone on imessage? Or are IM a whole nother story for a later date? (I just wish I could use X app and send messages, full resolution photos, HD video, read receipt, typing notify, to someone on Y app). Marcellus1 I don't know specifically what apps will get RCS and what ones won't. Hopefully all messaging apps will support it at some point. I suspect if there are any holdouts, iMessage would be the main one just because Apple likes to be intentionally incompatible. The goal of RCS, though, is to have exactly what you said is your wish. Borgman Man I sure hope that happens!!! Latheryin Will never take off as the standard. Not for a least 10 years. Joshua Canada already has had RCS for many months. We only have a few carriers, so it can easily be standard in Canada. Latheryin Everywhere has it. It is just a matter of who will be using it and what version they will use. It will end up like Android pay.. It to mention that is a but too much privacy that many people just will not freely Give up. Mainly not with the anti Google movement going on right now. Marty For some reason the headline of this article made me remember what I used to think about Google several years ago. I was of the opinion that the mentality at Google was of forging a future of making everything free...at least free in the phone and service market to start. Back then my impression of Google was that it was lead by activistic, hippy-culture young people who wanted everything in life to be free. I felt Google would try to lead society to forge such a mindset that "profit" was evil and that humanity being free from wants and needs was the future they wanted. Viktor Ivanov Good thing they aren't, I'd be really worried if they were. Marty Maybe they were to a certain extent but couldn't manage to bring their ideals to fruition. The people running the show right now seem to be money-driven. Syukri Lajin Google trying to make the carriers move to a more centralized system. Good thing they showed good example by not making another messaging app just for RCS. :D freshprince_87 I hope the other 3 US carriers (T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T) adopts Google's RCS messaging network so that RCS finally replaces SMS/MMS forever . SMS/MMS needs to freaking die already! When that happens, there won't be a need for iMessage and it's blue bubbles anymore 😒. Because every phone except for iPhones (unless Apples updates it's messages app in iOS 11)will have the Google's version of iMessage messaging service, RCS, in the United States. Borgman I don't know how many bozo iphone friends I have who say "the picture you just send is hazy" or "why does Android not send HD pics or videos". Drives me crazy! Just want a simple way to send those things to my friends! Warren Skipper No matter if the rest of the world uses RCS, Apple will never adopt it simply because it involves connecting to Google. Add on top of the fact that Google will likely have access to all messages that come through and you have a perfect recipe for Apple to publicly stand against it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson Not sure what you mean by "Connecting to Google", if Apple were to ever adopt RCS they would just have to utilize the exact same API's that every other OEM (Windows Phones, Android, etc...) uses. The only thing Google is doing is promoting the standard and trying to push adoption. Warren Skipper From everything I've read, there are some parts of the universal profile that seem to be Google-specific. In this article by Mobilesyrup, the carrier network Rogers stated “It’s a Google managed service”: http://mobilesyrup.com/2017/05/11/rcs-messaging-sms-canada-explainer/ I could be wrong though.Even if so, Apple wouldn't adopt it on the basis of privacy. Jayson Stephenson What he was mentioning in that paragraph that you quoted was the Google Jibe platform which those carriers have agreed to utilize to have Google host the server infrastructure for them. Look at the previous paragraph... "One point Sarhangi is quick to reiterate multiple times throughout our interview is that RCS “is not a Google service.”" RCS is NOT a Google exclusive service. Any Carrier, or OS, or Hardware manufacturer can utilize RCS 100% without any involvement of Google whatsoever. Warren Skipper You're mistaken what I'm saying. I know this is not Google exclusive. I also understand that any carrier can implement it along with OEMs like Samsung who can host the servers in lieu of Google. However, it's highly likely that Google has some form of code within the universal profile itself, that they can track, that is beyond whoever implements RCS. Again I could be wrong but either way, RCS has to go through someone's servers and who's ever it is will have the ability to mine everything that goes through it. Nicholas Conrad But apple hates industry standard, it interferes with their platform lock-in. mrjayviper Did that mean SMS communications will be data mined by Google as well? I believe they can't do that right now? h4rr4r Why not? They can read anything the device sends. If you own the kernel you own it all. mrjayviper Google can't read my SMS right now success they are not part of the process Ryan yes, they can. as he said they can technically read anything that exits your phone, if they choose to do so. This is how the current sms backup function works. Also if you use android messages they are already in the process mrjayviper i don't backup my SMS h4rr4r Google made the software that displays the text. If you use an Android phone. eddiepearson Honestly, don't care about this unless this means TMO will implement this tomorrow. All of this is null if TMO continues to not give a crap. You can get those free poop goodies every Tuesday though. bekifft The Venn diagram of people on Sprint with friends in Canada (and vice versa) are going to be very excited about this! JD So what Google is saying is RCS will be an unreliable POS that will be in Beta forever. Santos Chavez No that is not at all what they're saying. thecoolkid So now Google will be reading our texts too...? kamiller42 Control the hub? Control the world! Nice one, stop shop for intelligence agencies. Will hub participants be given access to all traffic on the hub? I'm sure Google will. "Better to mine you with my pretty!" MeCampbell30 I'm sure the carriers have no intention of letting google profit at their expense. kamiller42 The answer? Enticement. Offer the carriers the access to the products of the data mining. "We all benefit." Abhishek Saral RCS is just for SMS or are there any other benefits? senoredusty Separate ideas. Your question doesn't really make sense. Think of RCS ad the evolution of SMS Abhishek Saral Try to understand the context. It's just for sending messages or something else. senoredusty Yes. It's like fancy SMS. Read receipts, higher quality media, typing indicators, etc. Abhishek Saral People in US should start using WhatsApp already. Instead of making things tough for everyone. senoredusty Everyone in the US uses SMS already. If, over the course of time, people are naturally transitioned from SMS to RCS, that's a lot smaller a barrier than trying to convince each and every person to install yet another app. Sprint is going in the right direction with this, having Android Messages installed by default on all new Android devices. Also IMO WhatsApp is ugly. I don't want to use it, so I'm not about to try to convince everyone else they should. I'd much rather see Textra gain RCS functionality. Duder12 Fixed for you. *iPhone users in US should stop using iMessage already. Instead of making things tough for everyone.* Jay Who care? Americans have locked themselves into a vicious cycle, where 'SMS FALLBACK' in 2017 is necessary and their own self created injury infliction about being the 'green text' to 'blue text' users. Be it whatsapp or telegram or wechat, the rest of the world seems a lot more sane and the messaging discussion has not been one, in a lot of places on earth for years now. Instead here we are in 2017, with americans ranting about SMS and 'the imessage for android'. Something most nations will not care about Santos Chavez I think a lot of has to do with the fact that many folks here aren't really technically knowledged. Most never use any other app other than what came with their phone. Hence why SMS is still a thing, they just use that app to communicate with everyone. By gradually moving things over to RCS, those same consumers would still benefit from advanced messaging even if they never change their app. Sprint is helping with that since they're installing Android Messages by default on all new phones, and they already support RCS. ThePublisher So Google will be able to read all texts... awesome... Erstam Why don't they have Google voice setup with this already? James Where does it say Jibe will provide the hub connection to carriers for free? davidtb I could see how Google (a non-carrier) would want a piece of every RCS message (via their servers) who's at the center of the hub? RCS is pretty, but not a necessity, needa I wonder if Google is going to let everyone in the hub get the data. Yuri Vidal Can someone please explain me why use RCS (Or even SMS) would be better than simply using internet IP messaging systems? (WhatsApp, Telegram, Hangout, and so many others...) Paul Hansen A universal platform for all mobile devices. Not just the ones with a particular app installed. Santos Chavez Because then you could message someone the same way as those apps, but it wouldn't even matter what app they're using. For example, SMS apps will adopt the standard, as well (Textra devs have already said they will support it) so an Android Messages user on Sprint would be able to RCS with a Textra user on Rogers while having the same exact features of WhatsApp, Facebook, etc (like read receipts, typing indicators, large video sending, high quality pictures, and so on). Believe it or not, not everyone uses those other apps, especially here in the US. And even if they had an account in one or more of the apps, they may not be active on it anymore, like it is the case with my friends. With RCS you'd still be able to reach them anyway and have all of the advanced features those apps provide, across carriers and across apps. 2 Men-E I just want this to come to Project Fi Santos Chavez Me too! Really hoping that because Google owns the infrastructure and that they've streamlined the requirements to bridge to other carriers, it'll come to Fi pretty soon. Should be lots easier for them than all of the other carriers anywhere, after all :P Sonic Sunglasses I'm sure AT$T is busy working out its strategic plan to be dead last in implementing this technology. KChristainsen So basically we're still far off from RCS becoming a reality, unreal Jeff Saul Everything goes through the Google. It has been decreed. Humans will bow down to the Google. The Google reigns supreme. Soraya Xel For Google's next trick: Steal everyone's SMS data too. xyz No big deal. In most countries, the telecom regulators will set a standard that all carriers will have to follow. In the US, it'll be a mess. Đức Thành This is always the case: Google wants to help make something better for everyone, they have an idea that can help people improve things for themselves, which then more often than not gets rejected because everyone is a selfish and foolish asshole whose only interest is their own short-term benefits. Much of humanity is like that. Sometimes I think I can begin to get why in sci-fi movies the supreme AI ruler just wants to get rid of all humanity: Humanity's stupidity is a threat to their very existence.

Both Google Search Appliance (for bigger sites and enterprise search) and Google Site Search (for smaller sites) are now on the way out. What’s happening to Google Search Appliance and Site Search? Google Search Appliance (GSA) is an all-in-one yellow server box that sits in the corporate data centre which is used for all aspects of company search (intranet, extranet and website search). There’s still no official notice of end-of-life from Google on the GSA website, which seems remiss. But according to reports, such as this one from Fortune, and conversations with Google search partners (who sell, install and customise GSA), the product is no longer for sale to new customers and license renewals for existing customers are expected to end in 2018. A Google search for “Google Search Appliance” delivers a number of paid search ads for “GSA replacement” or “GSA alternative” from vendors such as Yippy, Swiftype and Mindbreeze. It is unlikely Google would allow this if GSA was ongoing. Google Site Search (GSS) is a widget you'll be familiar with that adds a search box to the host site and performs a Google search, but only of pages on that site. Search results would look like this "site:econsultancy.com site search" – but without the ads. There is some opportunity for customisation, including removing the Google branding from the search box. Despite the fact that the two outgoing products Site Search and Search Appliance sit side by side on Google’s Enterprise Search pages they are two quite different beasts. Graham Gillen, Vice President, Marketing, Search Technologies, an international search consultancy that has worked on more than 200 GSA implementations, explains: “Google Site Search is a service that you license from Google in exchange for an annual fee that is tied to the total content amount. You have some degree of control but not much. The advantage is it has zero footprint and you generally don’t maintain it at all. “Google Search Appliance is used for ecommerce web search or for your intranet to search documents internally. It is much more configurable than GSS and much more powerful, however you did have to do some work to implement it (or hire a company). According to an official notice on the GSS site, the product will be “completely shut down by April 1 2018”. The assumption is that on shut down GSS will default to the free product Custom Search Engine (see below) and ads will start to appear in search results – potentially for a competitor – which would be no April Fools’ joke. So, what is Google providing instead? Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) is a free search widget, but delivers search results with ads (see screenshot of the Stuff website below) – the same ads shown in Google web search. Once GSA and GSS have been killed off, this will be the only Google search option for websites (as things stand). Publishers will receive 51% of revenue from any search ads on shown on their sites, via AdSense for Search. Google Cloud Search is part of G-Suite – which is a Microsoft Office-like set of productivity tools aimed at knowledge workers. The Google Suite website suggests there are elements of enterprise search, e.g. searching the corporate directory. But there is no website search tool. The question is: are companies ready to replace a Google Appliance that sits within the corporate datacentre for a cloud-based service? Miles Kehoe, President, at search consultancy New Idea Engineering: “Google is getting rid of both of the enterprise/site search products in favour of corporate search where all of your searchable content lives at Google, rather than behind your firewall. “I know banks and big corporations are wary of moving their confidential company content out from behind their firewalls – even if Google promises it’s secure.” So customers of GSA and GSS need to start rethinking their web & enterprise search strategy promptly.   How many companies are affected by the demise of GSA and GSS? Unfortunately analysts companies, e.g. Gartner, IDC, do not appear to track market share of search technologies, and Google doesn’t publicise numbers or share them with implementation partners. BuiltWith, a site that tracks the technologies that underpin websites, believes that GSA is currently live on 189,849 websites globally and including 2% among the top 10,000 websites. There are nine case studies listed on the GSA site. Xerox, World Bank, Vodafone, Discovery Channel, Honeywell Aerospace, British Airways, Hays, Société Générale and City of Calgary. Many of these are intranet (internal) search deployments, rather than website ones. But searches on BuiltWith suggest that the websites of Calgory.ca and Hays.com still use the appliance. Finding data on usage of Google Site Search is harder. BuiltWith and SimilarTech, a similar type of service, do not appear to distinguish between GSS (the paid version) and CSE (the free version). BuiltWith believes that 596,645 websites globally using CSE, including 5% among the top 10,000 websites. If correct, this eclipses the collective users of rival search products (as identified by BuiltWith) such as Algolia, Swiftype, Hawk Search, SearchSpring, Queryly, Klevu and Coveo. SimilarTech, which also tracks the technologies that underpin websites, reckons that 287,857 websites globally use CSE. The largest websites using CSE, according to SimilarTech, include GSMArena, Stuff.co.nz, Purdue University and NVidia. It’s clear from the search box branding that Stuff.co.nz and Purdue.edu are using CSE (the other two could also be using CSE, but without branding). The search results (as shown in the image below) reveal that Stuff uses the free version and Purdue uses the paid, ad-free version.   What are the replacements for GSA? There are no shortage of vendors targeting the search market, many of them targeting different aspects of the market. So it is important for companies to identify their needs, then come up with a short list of appropriate suitors. Gartner has done a good job of differentiating between the enterprise search providers or what it now refers to as “Insight engines” i.e. those that focus predominantly on intranet/internal company search from those vendors that focus on website search. Insight engines in the Gartner March 2017 Magic Quadrant include: Attivio, Coveo, Dassault Systems, Funnelback, IBM, Lucidworks, Microsoft, Mindbreeze, Sinequa and Smartlogic.  Enterprise search providers fall into a number of different categories, which Miles Kehoe lists as: Cloud based, e.g. Google Cloud Search. Search appliance, e.g. Mindbreeze, SearchBlox, Yippy. Hosted search / software as a service (SAAS), e.g. Algolia. Traditional enterprise search, e.g. Coveo, Lucidworks Fusion, Attivio. Open Source (popular and ‘free’, but require considerable investment) e.g. Apache Lucene, Solr, Elasticsearch (both based on Lucene). What are the alternative website search engines? Among the website search engines, Gartner has split out those best suited to commerce search. In a January 2017 market report, research director Mike Lowndes identified and profiled 21 different vendors. Commerce search providers included (each with a notable reference customer): Algolia (Quicksilver), Attraqt (Tesco), BloomReach (Sears), Celebros (Avon), EasyAsk (North Face), Episerver Find (Electolux), Fredhopper (ASOS), GroupBy Cloud (CVS), IBM (1-800-Flowers.com), Inbenta (Carrefour), Lucidworks (Home Depot), Omni Retail Sidekick (Toys "R" Us),  and Sentient Aware (Skechers). It's important to note that many of these web search engines are based on the Open Source engines, Lucene, Solr or Elastic. The majority of the engines listed are available on a SAAS model, many hosted in the cloud, e.g. Algolia, Episerver. Lowndes identifies some trends among commerce engines that could influence vendor selection: Integration of recommendation engines. Personalized search (based on browser/search behaviour). Intent-driven results and navigation, including ability to understand "lifestyle" questions. Algorithmic product grouping – grouping related products. Natural-language processing (NLP) – understanding/reacting to spoken or written natural language. Act now Customers of GSA and GSS need to start rethinking their web/enterprise search strategy promptly. Remember, GSS customers will probably have an earlier deadline but GSA customers face a potentially much trickier migration, assuming the use of GSA across the full remit of enterprise search. Users of both solutions need to evaluate the alternative vendors – of which there are many.

Apple doesn't store data as long as Amazon or Google. Todd Haselton | @robotodd 18 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Apple has struggled to make Siri as smart as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa because of disagreements among its staff and its decisions to limit how long it stores user data, former Apple employees told The Wall Street Journal. Apple unveiled a new version of Siri during its WWDC keynote address on Monday but failed to show the world how it's much better than competing products from Google and Amazon. There are a few areas where blame can be placed. The Journal said Apple keeps data for only six months while Google and Amazon continue to hold on to it, learning more and more about specific users as they continue to use the personal assistants. That means Siri has less information to query when it tries to predict what a user wants. The Journal said Apple employees have struggled with company leaders, who have resisted allowing Siri to fully tap into third party apps, among other things. It's certainly a major paint point: A user can only access select apps pre-approved by Apple using Siri. One might book a reservation at a restaurant using OpenTable, for example, which is approved by Apple. That same user can't ask Siri to play music through Spotify, which competes with Apple Music. Alexa and Google Assistant don't have those limitations. This has led to all sorts of shake-ups, including two co-founders who left Apple and created another start-up, Viv Labs, which was acquired by Samsung. The Journal said two other Siri employees landed at Google and Amazon. Competitors are starting to creep right onto Apple's turf, too. Google recently launched Google Assistant for iPhone, which we put head-to-head with Siri. While it's not the newest version of Siri that will launch this fall, Google Assistant was much more valuable and accurate than Siri in our tests. Amazon has started to bring Alexa to smartphones, too. While competitors may be smarter than Siri, Apple may still be able to come out on top among consumers who care more about privacy than they do accurate answers from voice assistants. Strong loyalty to Apple's universe is another factor. Apple did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Read the full The Wall Street Journal report here.
