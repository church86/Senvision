Ministers are considering a new law which would mean Google – which owns YouTube - and other social media sites like Facebook and Twitter can be prosecuted if they allow such videos to be disseminated. Theresa May, the Prime Minister, made clear her displeasure at internet companies that publish extremist content on Friday, saying "the ball is in their court” over taking action. Google publicly apologised this week after the growing scandal over extremist videos on YouTube led to a series of companies pulling their adverts from the internet giant. Google, which owns the video sharing website YouTube, and other social media sites have an agreement to take down extremist content within 24 hours when they are alerted to it. But ministers are worried that this still allows the videos to be viewed thousands of times before they are taken down. However ministers in the Home Office are now looking at a new law to force the websites to take down content immediately or face court action. Officials are trying to work out how the law can be enforced in the UK given that many films that can be seen in the UK are hosted on foreign websites. One source said: "We want to see them take on their responsibility. The problem with the law is in itself we can do what we can but these are global companies.” The Home Office’s talks with the internet companies are being led by Baroness Shields, who as Joanna Shields was a former Facebook executive. The news came as Mrs May’s spokesman said that "social media companies can and must do more”. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: "The fight against terrorism and hate speech has to be a joint one. The government and security services are doing everything they can and it is clear that social media companies can and must do more. "Social media companies have a responsibility when it comes to making sure this material is not disseminated and we have been clear repeatedly that we think that they can and must do more. We are always talking with them on how to achieve that "The ball is now in their court. We will see how they respond.” Currently websites are deemed not to have liability for content as long as they take remove it swiftly when given notice. A recent survey in Germany found that Google took down 90 per cent of extremist sites within 24 hours of being notified. Google sources stressed the company had a good record at taking down extremist content, adding that 98 per cent of flagged videos are reviewed within 24 hours. One said: "We move content swiftly when it is drawn to our attention.” Earlier this week MPs suggested that Google risked breaking anti-terrorism laws by allegedly failing to remove illegal recruitment videos posted by banned far-Right group National Action from YouTube. Robert Buckland, the Solicitor-General, said that Google could be breaking the law if it is found to have been "reckless" in allowing the material to remain online. Under the Terrorism Act 2006 it is an offence to disseminate terrorist material either "intentionally" or "recklessly". Google was also accused of "profiting from hatred” following concerns that adverts were appearing alongside extremist material on its YouTube platform. Marks & Spencer became the latest company to withdraw its adverts from Google, following in the footsteps of the likes of McDonald’s, L’Oreal and the BBC. بازگشت به بالای صفحه 0 .به کانال تلگرام ما بپیوندید روی خط سایت ها سوپرمارکت آنلاین مصرف دارچین به سلامت دستگاه گوارش کمک می کند یه پیشنهاد فوق العاده رزرو آنلاین هتل مدیا ویدیوی شیوه عجیب پاسخگویی وزیر راه در فرودگاه / ویدیوی تکنیک جالب گران فروشی طلافروشان / ویدیوی حرف های مهناز افشار درباره... آیا تازه صدای خرد شدن استخوان های محرومان را شنیده‌اید؟/ گلایه جواد خیابانی از اشتباه‌پنداری برخی مخاطبان/... ترامپ؛ به ظرافت احمدی‌نژاد / آیت‌الله مکارم شیرازی: تخطی از رعایت قوانین راهنمایی و رانندگی گناه است پاسخ به شایعاتی درباره استخر محل فوت آیت‌الله هاشمی/ تاثیر تصادفات جاده‌ای بر عمل پیوند عضو در ایران/... نظر شما نام: ایمیل: * نظر: آخرین اخبار انهدام باند سارقان خودرو در کرج تأثیرگذارترین دانشمندان زن جهان روزنما: نمایی از دیوار کنونی پلاسکو روحانی مسکو را به مقصد تهران ترک کرد هوای پاک تهران در ایام نوروز شبی که امام (ره) به جای سرباز بیت نگهبانی داد پاسخ به شایعاتی درباره استخر محل فوت آیت‌الله هاشمی/ تاثیر تصادفات جاده‌ای بر عمل پیوند عضو در ایران/ اعلام نرخ تورم سال ٩٥/ واکنش علی دایی به برد ایران برابر چین/ کارگران «آدمند» نه «آهن»! چرا «ماجرای نیمروز» در سینمای ایران یک اتفاق مهم است؟ رهبران آمریکا و چین به زودی دیدار می‌کنند تبادل اسناد همکاری روسای جمهور ایران و روسیه اولین پس لرزه های «برگزیت»؛ همه پرسی جدایی اسکاتلند از بریتانیا احتمال فروش هواپیمای پیشرفته روسی به ایران روحانی پنجشنبه به گیلان می‌رود ثبت ۲۴ میلیون اقامت نوروزی تا نیمه تعطیلات سه کودک در میانه غرق شدند وب گردی ۴ علت بوی بد دهان! حقیقتی درباره پیوند استرس و سفید شدن مو برگزاری کوچکترین مسابقه اتومبیل رانی جهان بر روی یک قطعه طلا راهنمای خرید یک گوشی هوشمند میان رده مقرون‌به‌صرفه پیدا کردن افراد در اینستاگرام به وسیله شماره موبایل خواص آویشن چیست وقتی کبد چرب سلامت شما را به خطر می اندازد علت ضخیم شدن دیواره قلب چیست و چگونه درمان می شود؟ شناسایی چهره مردی هفتصد ساله به کمک فناوری تشخیص چهره ۶ قابلیت جدید برای اپلیکیشن واتس اپ درد بعد از پرکردن دندان و راه های درمان آن چگونه به بازارهای بین المللی وارد شویم? راه حلی برای از بین بردن بوی سیر دریای مرده کجاست؟ شگفت انگیزترین غارهای جهان (عکس) آب خوردن در این زمان ها ضرر دارد سارقان اخاذ خودرو در شیراز به آخر خط رسیدند آيا ميدانيد؟! پربازدید ها پربحث ترین عناوین تهدید ایران توسط داعش آنهم با زبان فارسی/ سانسور فیلم به خاطر یک شباهت!/ پاداش 12 هزار دلاری فدراسیون به شاگردان کی‌روش/ چرا سیداحمد چند روز پشت سر امام نماز نخواند؟ از «اگر تهمت زنندگان اصلاح شوند، پدرم حلالشان می کند» تا «دوران ترامپ بهترین فرصت برای حل همیشگی مشکلات ایران و آمریکا» از «بزرگترین رقیب روحانی در انتخابات ریاست جمهوری» تا «عذرخواهی حجاریان از اصغر فرهادی» معرفی همه چهره های معروفی که برای شورای شهر تهران کاندیدا شدند + اسامی پایان تلخ آخرین معشوقه دیکتاتور ورود نیروهای کُرد «دموکراتیک سوریه» به رقه، پایتخت احتمالی جدید داعش در دوران پسا رقه و شایعات مربوط به مرگ بشار اسد پشت پرده سفر نوروزی روحانی به روسیه/ انتقاد تند آیت‌الله جوادی‌آملی از بانک ها/ توصیه سخنگوی دولت اصلاحات به رئیس جمهور/ آمار مشاور رهبر انقلاب از تعداد بیکاران/ روایت مهناز افشار از زندگی شخصی با رامین تصاویری از زنان گشت ارشاد اندونزی تهدید ایران در ویدئوی داعش به زبان فارسی! تصاویری از کتک کاری تفریحی در تمرین تیم‌ملی! ادعاهای عجیبب اردوغان علیه ایران علاقه مارچلو لیپی به «کباب کوبیده» ایران1 - چین 0 / چینی ساخت ایتالیا هم در آزادی شکست/دومین عیدی یوزها وکی روش با گل طارمی+جدول جراحی زیبایی حیرت‌آور دختری که چانه نداشت ساعتی که اگر تنظیم شود، نوروز پربارتر خواهد شد آقای احمدی نژاد شب عملیات کربلای۵ کجا بودی؟  (۸۸ نظر) با مشکل بی اعتنایی به «لطفا پارک نکنید» چه باید کرد؟  (۷۷ نظر) تهدید ایران در ویدئوی داعش به زبان فارسی!  (۴۴ نظر) باید ترمز خودروسازها برای افزایش قیمت کشیده شود!  (۴۱ نظر) برخورد جدی دیگری بین شناورهای ایران و آمریکا در تنگه هرمز / افزایش خشونت در رفتار شناورهای آمریکایی  (۳۹ نظر) همه آمده اند؛ از آقازاده ها تا افشاگر، داور، مربی، هنرمند و واعظ منتقد!  (۳۹ نظر) برداشت موز در زرآباد کنارک  (۳۵ نظر) اردوغان کمک به تروریست های منطقه را افتخار می داند؟  (۳۳ نظر) ادعاهای عجیبب اردوغان علیه ایران  (۲۹ نظر) بیماران در ایران از چه حقوقی برخوردارند؟  (۲۹ نظر) تصاویری از زنان گشت ارشاد اندونزی  (۲۳ نظر) درگذشت رییس پلیس راه چابکسر بر اثر تصادف  (۲۳ نظر) تهدید ایران توسط داعش آنهم با زبان فارسی/ سانسور فیلم به خاطر یک شباهت!/ پاداش 12 هزار دلاری فدراسیون به شاگردان کی‌روش/ چرا سیداحمد چند روز پشت سر امام نماز نخواند؟  (۲۲ نظر) خدمات مبتنی بر محتوا در قبوض تلفن همراه چیست؟  (۲۰ نظر) علاقه مارچلو لیپی به «کباب کوبیده»  (۱۳ نظر) فارسی العریبة صفحه نخست تابناک جهان اقتصادی ورزشی اجتماعی مجلس ویدیو انتخابات درباره ما تماس با ما خبرنامه پیوندها جستجو آرشیو آب و هوا اوقات شرعی RSS تمام حقوق مادی و معنوی این سایت متعلق به تابناک می باشد و استفاده از مطالب با ذکر منبع بلامانع است. طراحی و تولید "ایران سامانه"

Downloading all your apps from the Google Play store -- where software is vetted – is perhaps the best advice. But that doesn’t mean Google Play is perfect. Security researchers do find new Android malware lurking on Google’s official app store. That’s because hackers are coming up with sneaky ways to infiltrate the platform, despite the vetting processes that protect it. "Eventually, every wall can be breached," said Daniel Padon, a researcher at mobile security provider Check Point. To be sure, most Android users will probably never encounter malware on the Google Play store. Last year, the amount of malicious software that reached the platform amounted to only 0.16 percent of all apps, according to a new report from Google. That's contributed to relatively tiny malware infection rates across the 1.4 billion Android devices in use today. But when a bad app does slip in to the Play store, it can spread. Check Point has been among the security firms on the watch for new android malware. Earlier this year, it uncovered over 20 apps on the Google Play store that contained malicious coding designed to generate fraudulent ad revenue for its creators. The infected software was downloaded several million times. Months before, Check Point found another malware strain that was embedded in dozens of different apps on the store. The malware was designed to enslave devices in a botnet and appeared to infect between 500,000 and 2 million devices. Trend Micro Android malware called DressCode spread through dozens of apps on Google Play last year. So how does the malware get in? Every app that goes through Google Play is first scanned for any harmful behavior, which includes checking the coding and running it in a virtual environment. But even so, malicious processes can be tricky to detect, Padon said. For instance, hackers will incorporate a "dropper" into a seemingly benign app. The dropper will act as a time-bomb, staying silent but downloading additional malware at a later time. In other cases, hackers have been found hiding malicious coding by using encryption, surrounding it with meaningless commands, or designing the harmful processes to remain inactive when run on a virtual machine. Padon said the internet giant could be doing more to vet apps. The problem, he claims, is that Google relies too much on automated testing to root out the problem. "It might be the strongest behavioral analysis engine on the planet," Padon said. But testing each app on a real, human-operated device is still the best way to detect malware, he said. Google didn’t comment on this story. However, it’s latest Android security report, published this week, does say: "no review process is perfect." Each month, the Play store will add 40,000 or more apps, according to AppBrain. Managing that business while keeping the software malware-free is no easy task. Automated testing is the best bet to scan all those apps in a time-efficient way. Nevertheless, the security of Android has often been compared to Apple’s iOS, and the result hasn’t always been favorable. Unlike iOS, which is under the control of Apple, the Android operating system is fragmented across numerous handset vendors, some of which struggle to keep the software securely patched. That’s made Android, and the Google Play store, worthwhile targets for hackers. "Since most users expect the apps in Google Play to be clean, they’re left vulnerable, making it easy for the malware to infect a massive number of users at once," said Rowland Yu, a researcher with security firm Sophos. In the past two years, there have been more than two dozen malware strains found slipping into the Google Play store, according to his research. To try and popularize the malware, hackers will make them look like games, utility apps like energy savers, or drum up fake reviews for them. Fortunately, when Google detects any malware, it will quickly pull the apps from the store, and sometimes ban the developers involved, Yu said. But he doesn’t see an end to this cat and mouse game. Like Padon, Yu points to machine testing. "Google heavily relies on machines to test and review the safety and security of apps," he said. "Only a small number of suspicious apps are actually handed over for human review." Google Install rates for potentially harmful applications and unwanted software on Android devices are higher when users download from third-party app stores, according to Google. However, even as malware occasionally slips by, Google is making progress at detecting it faster once it's downloaded, in part with a feature in Android devices called "Verify Apps." It will scan the software over a phone to make sure the apps are behaving safely. If they aren't, the security feature can have the offending apps removed. "Verify Apps conducted 750 million daily checks in 2016," Google’s security researchers said in a blog post. This helped the company reduce malicious app installation last year. Andrew Blaich, a security researcher at mobile security firm Lookout, said the malware situation on Google Play isn’t the pandemic that can be found on some third-party Android app stores, which often do less vetting. "The safest assurance you have to minimize your chance of malware on your Android device is to use the official Google Play store," he said. Security researchers also advise users to always look at the user reviews for an app. Bad reviews can be a sign that the app is malicious in some way.

Earlier this week, Apple launched Clips video creation and sharing app for iPhone and iPad. The report says Google’s new app will come with some of the same features as Clips. With Google’s new app, users can reportedly collaborate and create groups to share and edit photos. The app is said to come with Google’s artificial intelligence capabilities that will help users to tag and organize photos. It would also be able to identify objects in a photograph and then group them. The report did not share any other details of the new app but it will be interesting to see what Google has to offer. Last year, Google launched Allo and Duo apps which have been updated regularly with new features and improvements. It is not known when Google is planning to release the new photo editing app. Source "Google is said to be working on a new social app for sharing and editing photos", 5 out of 5 based on 5 ratings.

The company has announced that it will shut down Google Talks aka Gtalk/GChat feature in Gmail on June 26 and it will be replaced with Hangouts. Users will be  will automatically be transitioned to Hangouts. Gtalk launched in 2005 as an official chat client for Gmail users. In 2013, the company began replacing Google Talk with Hangouts, while still giving users the option to continue using Google Talk. If you are still using the old Google Talk Android app, which was replaced with Hangouts in 2013 in the Google Play Store, that app will now stop working. Moreover, as reported earlier this week, Google is officially killing SMS support for Hangouts for Android on May 22. The company is encouraging Android users to switch over to the newly renamed Android Messages app. After Google removed messaging app on Nexus devices and released an updated Hangouts app that combined SMS and Hangouts conversation at the end of 2014, it released a standalone Messenger app in November 2014, which was recently renamed as Android Messages. Finally, Google is also retiring a number of Gmail Lab add-ons on or around April 24. They include Authentication Icon, Google Voice Player, Picasa previews, Pictures in chat, Quick Links, Quote Selected Text, Smartlabels, and Yelp previews. Finally, two legacy Google+ features in Gmail, the ability to email Google+ profiles and the use of Google+ Circles, will also be retired on April 24.

The developers’ OS showcases several major changes in store, ahead of the system’s official presentation at the Google I/O conference in May. Google promises to boost device battery life with Android O by restricting the activity of applications running in the background, making them more power-efficient and less battery-draining. A new autofill function will be able to store data such as usernames, passwords, addresses or credit card details and automatically fill out forms. Plus, the update brings “Picture in Picture” (PiP) display capabilities for watching a video while using other apps alongside. Android O overhauls notifications too, allowing developers to create themed notification channels, grouping alerts from various apps so users can decide which ones they receive. In general, users will have greater control over notifications and which ones they want to see displayed onscreen. The number of notifications per app will also be displayed, as in iOS. Another visual change comes in the form of adaptive icons, matching the icon style to a user’s particular version of Android, with more rounded or square icon designs in the various manufacturer interfaces. Google has already stated that Android O will support the latest version of Java (8) as well as new wireless technologies like Sony’s LDAC codec for Hi-Res audio. This latest version of Android is expected to land in Google’s latest Pixel smartphones before progressively rolling out from fall this year. Google is yet to announce which sweet snack will lend its name to the latest OS.

The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  The Journal of the American Medical Association.  These are some the most elite academic journals in the world. And last year, one tech company, Alphabet’s Google, published papers in all of them. The unprecedented run of scientific results by the Mountain View search giant touched on everything from ophthalmology to computer games to neuroscience and climate models. For Google, 2016 was an annus mirabilis during which its researchers cracked the top journals and set records for sheer volume. Behind the surge is Google’s growing investment in artificial intelligence, particularly “deep learning,” a technique whose ability to make sense of images and other data is enhancing services like search and translation (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2013: Deep Learning”). According to the tally Google provided to MIT Technology Review, it published 218 journal or conference papers on machine learning in 2016, nearly twice as many as it did two years ago. We sought out similar data from the Web of Science, a service of Clarivate Analytics, which confirmed the upsurge. Clarivate said that the impact of Google’s publications, according to a measure of publication strength it uses, was four to five times the world average. Compared to all companies that publish prolifically on artificial intelligence, Clarivate ranks Google No. 1 by a wide margin. Top rank The publication explosion is no accident. Google has more than tripled the number of machine learning researchers working for the company over the last few years, according to Yoshua Bengio, a deep-learning specialist at the University of Montreal. “They have recruited like crazy,” he says. And to capture the first-round picks from computation labs, companies can’t only offer a Silicon Valley-sized salary.  “It’s hard to hire people just for money,” says Konrad Kording, a computational neuroscientist at Northwestern University. “The top people care about advancing the world, and that means writing papers the world can use, and writing code the world can use.” At Google, the scientific charge has been spearheaded by DeepMind, the high-concept British AI company started by neuroscientist and programmer Demis Hassabis. Google acquired it for $400 million in 2014.  Hassabis has left no doubt that he’s holding onto his scientific ambitions. In a January blog post, he said DeepMind has a “hybrid culture” between the long-term thinking of an academic department and “the speed and focus of the best startups.” Aligning with academic goals is “important to us personally,” he writes. Kording, one of whose post-doctoral students, Mohammad Azar, was recently hired by DeepMind, says that “it’s perfectly understood that the bulk of the projects advance science.” Recommended for You Elon Musk’s OpenAI Unveils a Simpler Way for Machines to Learn A New Direction for Artificial Intelligence? Customer Service Chatbots Are About to Become Frighteningly Realistic Harvard Scientists Moving Ahead on Plans for Atmospheric Geoengineering Experiments The World’s Largest Artificial Sun Could Help Generate Clean Fuel Last year, DeepMind published twice in Nature, the same storied journal where the structure of DNA and the sequencing of the human genome were first reported. One DeepMind paper concerned its program AlphaGo, which defeated top human players in the ancient game of Go; the other described how a neural network with a working memory could understand and adapt to new tasks. Then, in December, scientists from Google’s research division published the first deep-learning paper ever to appear in JAMA, the august journal of America’s physicians. In it, they showed a deep-learning program could diagnose a cause of blindness from retina images as well as a doctor. That project was led by Google Brain, a different AI group, based out of the company’s California headquarters. It also says it prioritizes publications, noting that researchers there “set their own agenda.” AI battle The contest to develop more powerful AI now involves hundreds of companies, with competition most intense between the top tech giants such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. All see the chance to reap new profits by using the technology to wring more from customer data, to get driverless cars on the road, or in medicine. Research is occurring in a hot house atmosphere reminiscent of the early days of computer chips, or of the first biotech plants and drugs, times when notable academic firsts also laid the foundation stones of new industries. That explains why publication score-keeping matters. The old academic saw “publish or perish” is starting to define the AI race, leaving companies that have weak publication records at a big disadvantage. Apple, famous for strict secrecy around its plans and product launches, found that its culture was hurting its efforts in AI, which have lagged those of Google and Facebook.  So when Apple hired computer scientist Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon last year as its new head of AI, he was immediately allowed to break Apple’s code of secrecy by blogging and giving talks. At a major machine-learning science conference late last year in Barcelona, Salakhutdinov made the point of announcing that Apple would start publishing, too.  He showed a slide: “Can we publish? Yes.” Salakhutdinov will speak at MIT Technology Review’s EmTech Digital event on artificial intelligence next week in San Francisco. Weren't able to make it to EmTech Digital? We've got you covered.

Hopefully by the end of this post, youll have a better understanding of what Google is actually trying to do. TL;DR available at the end of this post. If you remember, Google had already announced that Hangouts would transition to a collaboration/productivity-oriented platform. It announced two new features called Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. Hangouts meet would take advantage of Hangouts video calls with multiple participants to hold meetings. Hangouts Chat is self-explanatory. Hangouts' rebranding aside, Google is announcing that SMS integration with Hangouts will no longer be supported starting on May 22. For those of you using Project Fi or Google Hangouts, this will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. Android Messages is Googles rebranded Google Messenger. It will be dedicated to providing a simple SMS interface and remains the default SMS client for smartphones that otherwise dont have a stock SMS app. Google is also in the process of updating Android Messages to support RCS, which allows for larger attachments and longer text messages than SMS. It will also support read receipts. In addition, Google is fully transitioning Google Talk into Hangouts. Some of us didnt even know folks still used Google Talk, so hearing about it today may be a surprise to some. Also, for those who were still using Google Talk in your Gmail inbox, youll soon be prompted to update to Hangouts. Finally, the Legacy Google Talk app (last updated in 2013) will no longer function effective immediately. TL;DR: Google Talk will completely transition to Hangouts. Hangouts will remain a business and productivity platform. SMS will no longer be integrated into Hangouts as of May 22. Project Fi and Google Voice users will remain unaffected for now. Google will focus Android Messenger's efforts solely to SMS and RCS. Oh yeah, all this while Allo and Duo remain as Googles headlining communication feature, oriented for consumers of all types.

By: AP | San Francisco | Published:March 25, 2017 9:29 am PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube. (Source: AP) An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google’s ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos. It’s not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company’s confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won’t return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet’s net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody’s Investor Service predicted the backlash won’t last long because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet’s stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday.

In cases where management of a Google My Business listing has been handed over to a third party, it can sometimes be difficult for the actual business owner to regain control of their own listing. In these instances, when a business owner cannot get in touch with the current verifier of a listing, users can start the verification process themselves to prove they are in fact the rightful owner or current representative. If you find yourself in this situation, here are the steps to follow to reclaim ownership of your GMB listing: Navigate to Google My Business. Sign in to Google with the account you use to manage your business. Enter the name or address of your business, then select it from the search results. You may see a dialog showing part of the email address that verified the listing. If you manage this email address, sign in to that account to access your business listing. Fill out the form. The current listing owner may need to contact you for more info, so you won’t be able to submit your request without sharing your contact details with them. Click Submit. The current listing owner will receive an email asking them to get in touch with you, and you’ll receive a confirmation email. Check on the status of your request by clicking the link in your confirmation email. Allow a full 7 days for the current listing owner to respond to your request. If you don’t hear back after 7 days, you’ll be able to verify your affiliation with the business to gain access to the listing.

The said email has been shared over Reddit and states that the change will come into effect from May 22. The move is believed to be part of Google’s growing focus on the enterprise segment. Google recently launched a ‘Hangouts Meet‘ for corporate video conferencing. In the enterprise segment, Google already competes with Skype, and is now also facing competition from new products like Slack and Microsoft’s Teams.  Coming back to Hangouts, users who have enabled Hangouts as the default SMS app, will be notified from March 27 regarding the change.

The internet giant's core business of serving up advertising along with online search results appeared to be safe from the boycott, motivated by companies seeking assurances that their marketing messages won't be displayed along with hateful or outright terrorist content, particularly videos on Google-operated YouTube. The "backlash" could broaden into a rebellion against the market practice of software programming ad placements, slowing not only Google's revenue but also that of other internet firms, according to Jackdaw chief analyst Jan Dawson. "I would think Google (and parent company Alphabet) would be extremely lucky to emerge from all this with minimal financial impact," he said in a blog post. "I think it's far more likely it sees both a short-term dent in its revenues and profits from the spreading boycotts and possibly a longer-term impact as brands reconsider their commitments to programmatic advertising in general." California-based Google, which has seen a slew of companies withdraw ads fearing placement alongside extremist content, said this week it is introducing new tools to give firms greater control. "We know advertisers don't want their ads next to content that doesn't align with their values," Google's chief business officer Philipp Schindler said in a blog post. "We're taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content." - Hateful videos - The boycott began last week after the Times newspaper of London found BBC programs were promoted alongside videos posted by American white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke as well as Wagdi Ghoneim, an Islamist preacher banned from Britain for inciting hatred. The analysis found more than 200 anti-Semitic videos, and that Google had failed to remove six of them within the 24-hour period mandated by the European Union after it anonymously signaled their presence. The British government subsequently put its YouTube advertising on hold, saying in a statement, "it is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content." Others to pull the plug, temporarily at least, include the BBC, The Guardian newspaper group, McDonalds UK and the British arm of the major advertising agency Havas. The movement spread to the United States this week, with AT&T and Verizon pulling ads from Google. Google's parent Alphabet has lost slightly more than $20 billion in value since the start of this week based on a slip in its share price, in a sign the boycott has made investors nervous. - Limits of software - Still, analysts believe the boycott's overall financial impact should be relatively small given the breadth of Google's advertising activities. Even a "draconian" estimate of fiscal damage was limited to whittling perhaps a percent off Alphabet's revenue, Morgan Stanley said in a note to investors. "It is a hit on their revenue, but it is an even bigger hit on their brand; on their reputation," Altimeter Group principal analyst Charlene Li said. "Google hasn't taken it seriously enough." She recommended that Google engage advertisers directly and openly. A solution may not be easy. Google needs to strike a balance between pleasing advertisers and those who upload videos to YouTube and are free to take their creations elsewhere if unsatisfied with their shares of ad revenue. Google's setbacks could benefit traditional television networks as ad dollars return there from YouTube or stall a shift to online, Morgan Stanley said. Google rivals such as Facebook could also benefit if they prove safer havens for digital advertising. Above all, the boycott highlights the limits of "programmatic" advertising, the practice of letting software algorithms decide pairing between marketing messages and content sought by online viewers. The technology is broadly used by internet firms, which heavily rely on software and artificial intelligence to figure out what ads will interest people at any given moment. Advertisers can chose "keywords" for targeting their ads, or sometimes use demographic options such as age groups or where people live. Read More Google and the leading social network Facebook stopped publishing ads on websites posting sensational and fabricated stories following controversy about the role "fake news" may have played in the US presidential election last year. In February, YouTube ended an advertising partnership with its biggest star, PewDiePie, who had published videos containing anti-Semitic insults and Nazi references. The boycott will push for programmatic ad software to become more precise and better understand the content offered for pairing in order to reduce risks for advertisers, Li said.

(Barbara Ortutay) Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube's ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google's partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet's net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody's Investor Service predicted the backlash won't last long because Google is "laser-focused" on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet's stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday. AP Technology Writer Mae Anderson in New York contributed to this story. Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Google Inc.

Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Walmart and Dish joined an already impressive list of companies that have pulled their ads from the search giant over concerns the Silicon Valley giant isn’t able to ensure their ads will not pop up on unsavory sites or be attached to scummy videos. Google said it was stepping up its efforts to protect the brands. However, it might not be happening as quickly or be as effective as the advertisers had hoped. The four companies said they were suspending their ads on YouTube and on Google’s ad exchange after the Wall Street Journal reported that some ads were still being placed against anti-Semitic content. Other advertisers, including Starbucks, General Motors and FX Networks, said they were suspending their various activities with Google. Google has been ratcheting up its game — hiring more people and talking with advertisers about its efforts — to prevent ads appearing in objectionable content. The Friday exodus comes after a week of nonstop negative press that was kicked off by a March 17 Times of London report that resulted in an entire ad agency holding company yanking ads for all of its clients. Walmart, in a statement, said, “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values.” Google parent Alphabet has seen its market cap shrink by about $26 billion in a week. Its shares have fallen 4.5 percent since March 17, to $814.43 on Friday. Alphabet was downgraded on Monday by Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research which warned that unless Google could say its systems are foolproof it would continue to suffer from the fallout. Google has said it is retooling its video verification process and introducing new artificial intelligence in response to the problem. In an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg, Google added it would create a new hot line manned by humans. The WSJ found ads from Google’s own YouTube Red subscription service running on racist videos containing the “n—–” in the title. The ads are served up typically as part of automated or programmatic ad programs that deliver traffic to advertisers from across the web. Some marketers put filters to screen out blacklisted Web sites.

For those who are wondering how official this announcement is, Google has since confirmed on their blog that this indeed will be happening over the course of the next couple of months. According to Google, “In the next few weeks, you’ll see a notification in the classic Hangouts app to switch to another SMS app already on your phone for SMS, or to download Android Messages if one isn’t available. Choosing a new messaging app will not impact your SMS message history, and all your messages will be accessible in whichever new app you choose.” With Google starting to make Hangouts more enterprise focused with Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat, there are some who are speculating that the removal of SMS is part of their plan to perhaps create their own version of Slack or Microsoft Teams where Hangouts will be used as a tool for communications in the work space. Google has reassured users that the consumer version of Hangouts will not be going anywhere so for those who use it to chat with friends, it’s business as usual. However if you are looking for SMS integration, like Google said you can consider the Android Messages app as an alternative. Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Apps, Google and hangouts.

Although the current Hangouts app isn’t going away just yet, Google plans to start taking away some of its capabilities, starting with the removal of SMS functions. According to an email sent to GSuite administrators and subsequently posted to Reddit, Google will remove the SMS messaging feature from Hangouts on May 22. Hangouts users will reportedly be notified of this change via an in-app message starting March 27, and prompted to select a new default messaging app from the ones that are installed on the phone or to download a new one. If you are a Google Voice users you will still be able to send SMS texts from both Hangouts or the Google Voice app, just not using your carrier number anymore, only your Voice number. The company is likely trying to remove any associations Hangouts has with traditional SMS messaging, so it can position Hangouts Chat as more of a business collaboration tool, and leaving carrier SMS texts to the native Android Messages client or Allo — yes, Google’s messaging strategy has been a kind of a mess over the last few years and the company is trying to correct course.

When you write “Is s*x …?” into Google, the first thing to pop up is, “is s*x addiction real?” To answer this, the Daily Star Online spoke to Rebecca Dakin, The Great British Sexpert who revealed not only is is real, but it can consume your entire life. “Yes, it is a very real thing,” Rebecca said. “It is much more common now because of the Internet and the access to P0*n which is so readily available.” “It involves lack of control along with s*xual urges and behaviours, however it isn’t recognised medically as there is a debate of whether it’s just an excuse for infidelity.” Addiction to s*x can be likened to any other addiction – whether it be food, alcohol, caffeine – and can also be referred to as hyper s*xual behaviour or nymphomania. “In extreme cases, people want to have s*x multiple times a day and are constantly thinking about it,” Rebecca explained. “They could just be walking down the street and get a sudden urge and then will have to find the nearest bathroom just so they can relieve themselves. It can take over your life.” Rebecca explained it is difficult to know the exact number of people who suffer from the addiction as women don’t generally want to admit to it. “There is still a stigma around women who enjoy s*x as they are seen as ‘promiscuous’ or it’s shameful, and they are judged. So there are many women with s*x addictions who go undiagnosed,” she said. “s*x addiction can affect men and women at many different stages in their lives. There is a rise in younger, school-aged children because they have access to the internet at a younger age.” If you feel like you have a s*x addiction, Rebecca advised to do some research online first and see if you have any of the symptoms. With this knowledge, you can then seek help. Rebecca, who is a trained therapist, uses hypnotherapy on her clients to help them suppress their urges. Yet she said other options include psychotherapy, behavioural therapy, s*x addiction groups and in extreme cases, medication. However, if you think your partner is the one who suffers from addiction, communication is key. “You have to be able to talk openly with your partner and broach the topic sensitively,” she said. “Explore the options before you bring it up. In my experience you can’t just turn around to someone with an addiction and say you’re an addict. They have to figure it out for themselves. Be sensitive to how they may be feeling about it.” Rebecca said one of the things that can happen when you are in a relationship with some who is a s*x addict is the partner can feel they are seen as just s*x rather than a person, and a “lot of resentment building up there”. To avoid this, talk to your partner about it and figure out a way you can work through it together.

An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening in a sign of the skepticism surrounding Google’s promise to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Dish Network became the latest companies to suspend their advertising on YouTube after The Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. Even though the defections are continuing, most analysts aren’t worried yet. Starbucks and General Motors also joined in the YouTube boycott Friday, March 24, 2017. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File) Posted: Friday, March 24, 2017 12:15 pm More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott Associated Press | 0 comments SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can't lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube's ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google's partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet's net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody's Investor Service predicted the backlash won't last long because Google is "laser-focused" on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet's stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday. ___ AP Technology Writer Mae Anderson in New York contributed to this story. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Is DARPA’s Memex search engine a Google-killer? 14 Apr 2015 19 Google Post navigation Previous: Season 5 Game of Thrones episodes leaked online Next: Teen charged after using teacher’s admin password to access school computer by Mark Stockley 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit The history of computing features a succession of organisations that looked, for a while at least, as if they were so deeply embedded in our lives that we’d never do without them. IBM looked like that, and Microsoft did too. More recently it’s been Google and Facebook. Sometimes they look unassailable because, in the narrow territory they occupy, they are. When they do fall it isn’t because somebody storms that territory, they fall because the ground beneath them shifts. For years and years Linux enthusiasts proclaimed “this will be the year that Linux finally competes with Windows on the desktop!”, and every year it wasn’t. But Linux, under the brand name Android, eventually smoked Microsoft when ‘Desktop’ gave way to ‘Mobile’. Google has been the 800-pound gorilla of web search since the late 1990s and all attempts to out-Google it have failed. Its market share is rock solid and it’s seen off all challengers from lumbering tech leviathans to nimble and disruptive startups. Google will not cede its territory to a Google clone but it might one day find that its territory is not what it was. The web is getting deeper and darker and Google, Bing and Yahoo don’t actually search most of it. They don’t search the sites on anonymous, encrypted networks like Tor and I2P (the so-called Dark Web) and they don’t search the sites that have either asked to be ignored or that can’t be found by following links from other websites (the vast, virtual wasteland known as the Deep Web). The big search engines don’t ignore the Deep Web because there’s some impenetrable technical barrier that prevents them from indexing it – they do it because they’re commercial entities and the costs and benefits of searching beyond their current horizons don’t stack up. That’s fine for most of us, most of the time, but it means that there are a lot of sites that go un-indexed and lots of searches that the current crop of engines are very bad at. That’s why the US’s Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) invented a search engine for the deep web called Memex. Memex is designed to go beyond the one-size-fits-all approach of Google and deliver the domain-specific searches that are the very best solution for narrow interests. In its first year it’s been tackling the problems of human trafficking and slavery – things that, according to DARPA, have a significant presence beyond the gaze of commercial search engines. When we first reported on Memex in February, we knew that it would have potential far beyond that. What we didn’t know was that parts of it would become available more widely, to the likes of you and me. A lot of the project is still somewhat murky and most of the 17 technology partners involved are still unnamed, but the plan seems to be to lift the veil, at least partially, over the next two years, starting this Friday. That’s when an initial tranche of Memex components, including software from a team called Hyperion Gray, will be listed on DARPA’s Open Catalog. The Hyperion Gray team described their work to Forbes as: Advanced web crawling and scraping technologies, with a dose of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, with the goal of being able to retrieve virtually any content on the internet in an automated way. Eventually our system will be like an army of robot interns that can find stuff for you on the web, while you do important things like watch cat videos. More components will follow in December and, by the time the project wraps, a “general purpose technology” will be available. Memex and Google don’t overlap much, they solve different problems, they serve different needs and they’re funded in very different ways. But so were Linux and Microsoft. The tools that DARPA releases at the end of the project probably won’t be a direct competitor to Google but I expect they will be mature and better suited to certain government and business applications than Google is. That might not matter to Google but there are three reasons why Memex might catch its eye. The first is not news but it’s true none the less – the web is changing and so is internet use. When Google started there was no Snapchat, Bitcoin or Facebook. Nobody cared about the Deep Web because it was hard enough to find the things you actually wanted and nobody cared about the Dark Web (remember FreeNet?) because nobody knew what it was for. The second is this statement made by Christopher White, the man heading up the Memex team at DARPA, who’s clearly thinking big: The problem we're trying to address is that currently access to web content is mediated by a few very large commercial search engines - Google, Microsoft Bing, Yahoo - and essentially it's a one-size fits all interface... We've started with one domain, the human trafficking domain ... In the end we want it to be useful for any domain of interest. That's our ambitious goal: to enable a new kind of search engine, a new way to access public web content And the third is what we’ve just discovered – Memex isn’t just for spooks and G-Men, it’s for the rest of us to use and, more importantly, to play with. It’s one thing to use software and quite another to be able to change it. The beauty of open source software is that people are free to take it in new directions – just like Google did when it picked up Linux and turned it into Android.

Reply Mark Stockley says: April 14, 2015 at 1:58 pm I guess this is a rhetorical question but so our readers are clear – the Deep Web is everything beyond the ‘event horizon’ of commercial search engines. Reply 3th3r says: April 14, 2015 at 7:03 pm Erm no. The true deep web is deeper than that. It contains sites which cannot even be connected to unless you are on an anonymized distributed network and the sites have a TLD of .onion. Reply Mark Stockley says: April 14, 2015 at 9:41 pm At Naked Security we use Deep Web and Dark Web as follows (because we think it’s how they’re most commonly understood): Deep Web refers to sites on the World Wide Web that could be indexed by commercial search engines but aren’t because there are no references to them or because they’ve elected not to be indexed. Dark Web refers to the collection of websites on encrypted networks like I2P and Tor that you’re referring to. The Dark Web is a subset of Deep Web – it is true that sites on Tor are beyond the search horizon of commercial search engines but it is not true that all sites beyond the search horizon of commercial search engines are on Tor. Interestingly it’s a bit muddier than that – some .onion site content is available on the WWW, and indexable by Google, as a result of Tor2Web services like Onion City. https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/02/18/onion-city-a-search-engine-bringing-the-dark-web-into-the-light/ Reply Chris says: April 14, 2015 at 2:01 pm That’s deep, man.

It sounds like the basis to a God AI. Something out of Eagle Eye or Person of Interest. Especially if it actually gets smarter based on what it “reads.” Reply Ken says: April 14, 2015 at 5:57 pm “You are being watched. The government has a secret system: a machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I know, because I built it. I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything. Violent crimes involving ordinary people; people like you. Crimes the government considered ‘irrelevant’. They wouldn’t act, so I decided I would. But I needed a partner, someone with the skills to intervene. Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.

Any connection? Check out this web page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex_Technology_Limited Reply Laurence Marks says: April 14, 2015 at 7:49 pm No. The word memex (a portmanteau or word-combination of “memory” and “index”) was the subject of a 1945 paper by Vannevar Bush envisioning a future device very similar to today’s Apple or Android tablets. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex Reply puravidatf121 says: April 15, 2015 at 5:59 am Since DARPA is funded by … well you know who. It would seem to me this would just be another means of “TRACKING” folks. If the “Web absent of Light” which supposedly contains a large number of “Obscure” web sites with sometimes nefarious subject matter. Well I can’t help but think that if an individual were to search for said subject matter it would tag that search for follow-up. I’m just not buyin into a Government funded agency creating a Search Engine that should theoretically allow the user to be “Anonymous” unless of course their terms of use clearly state otherwise. I mean it’s already easy enough for L.E.O. to sit back and just watch the AZZHats post their illegal activities on You-Tube, Twitter, Instagram, etc. A search engine like this is just another tool for their use. Reply Mark Stockley says: April 15, 2015 at 11:30 am Government is a massive, many-headed beast. Don’t forget that the US Navy and DARPA developed and funded both the ARPANET (from which the Deep Web grew) and Tor (which makes up most of the Dark Web). By your own logic they wouldn’t need Memex to track people because they created the environments that Memex will be tracking you in. Memex components will be open source, like Tor, which means you’ll be free to find and remove any tracking you discover and give other people your tracking-free versions. Reply Pete Laberge says: April 15, 2015 at 9:29 am But then, let me ask you this: Could not Google, MS, et all…. Access MEMEX with their own resources…. And then, could they not make it (the data) available publicly, after you “click/sign” some waiver? Maybe even have to pay some triffle sum (say through Paypal (or whomever) for the privilege…. So now you could use the data on all of Google’s other properties. Gmail, Youtube, G+, etc…. And maybe use it on all of Microsoft’;s properties. Hum. The plot could be easily thickened. Because your “search” would then NOT be your search, but say a Google search… Good for paranoids. What DO you think, Sophos?

(Photo by Josh Reynolds for The Washington Post) Print Email The Washington Post By The Washington Post The Times-Picayune Follow on Twitter on March 24, 2017 at 7:10 PM comments As the owner of a small business in liberal Massachusetts, John Ellis was a natural sympathizer of the nationwide call for advertisers to boycott Breitbart News, with its hard-edge conservative politics and close ties to President Donald Trump. But it made Ellis wonder about other, more extreme right-wing sites: Who is placing ads on them? A few clicks around the Internet revealed a troubling answer: He was. On a website owned by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer, Ellis saw an ad for his engineering company, Optics for Hire, pop up on the screen - even though he had never knowingly bought the ad. What Ellis had stumbled on was a little-known facet of the booming world of Internet advertising. Businesses using the latest in online advertising technology offered by Google, Yahoo and major competitors are also increasingly finding their ads placed alongside politically extreme and derogatory content. That's because the ad networks offered by Google, Yahoo and others can display ads on vast numbers of third-party websites based on people's search and browsing histories. Although the strategy gives advertisers an unprecedented ability to reach customers who fit a narrow profile, it dramatically curtails their ability to control where their advertisements appear. "No one has any idea where their ads are going," Ellis said. In some cases, he added, ad networks "are monetizing hate." In a sign of growing frustration, AT&T, Verizon and other leading companies this week pulled their business from Google's AdSense network in response to news reports that ads had appeared with propaganda from the Islamic State and violent groups. But the issue is broader. A Washington Post examination of dozens of sites with politically extreme and derogatory content found that many were customers of leading ad networks, which share a portion of revenue gleaned from advertisers with the site's operators. The Post's examination found that the networks had displayed ads for Allstate, IBM, DirectTV and dozens of other household brand names on websites with content containing racial and ethnic slurs, Holocaust denial and disparaging comments about African Americans, Jews, women and gay people. Some of these sites, the Post found, featured hateful and derogatory content throughout. In others, it was confined to comment sections, where users went far beyond the language used by the sites' writers, whose expressed views fell closer to the political mainstream. Google's AdSense, for example, last month ran ads for several firms alongside comments using a slur for African-Americans, saying "hang them all." Other Google-displayed ads, for Macy's and the genetics company 23andMe, appeared on the website My Posting Career, which describes itself as a "white privilege zone," next to a notice saying the site would offer a referral bonus for each member related to Adolf Hitler. "No business wants to be associated with sites like that," said Andy Kill, spokesman for genetic testing company 23andMe. "If you're trusting an ad algorithm to do this, this is what can happen," he said. "It's frustrating." My Posting Career did not reply to an email seeking comment. The problem has emerged as Web advertising strategies have evolved. Advertisers sometimes choose to place their ads on particular sites - or avoid sites they dislike - but a growing share of advertising budgets go to what the industry calls "programmatic" buys. These ads are aimed at people whose demographic or consumer profile is receptive to a marketing message, no matter where they browse on the Internet. Algorithms decide where to place ads, based on people's prior Web usage, across vastly different types of sites. The technology companies behind ad networks have slowly begun to address the issue but warn that it won't be easy to solve. They say their algorithms struggle to distinguish between content that is truly offensive and language that is not offensive in context. For example, it can be hard for computers to determine the difference between the use of a racial slur on a white-supremacy site and a website about history. The tech companies have also long been reluctant to put themselves in the position of an arbiter of speech - given the subjectivity involved and the legal risk of making decisions about what content deserves to be read or not. It's a situation that tech giants are increasingly encountering in related spheres, too, with the proliferation of false and highly politicized news sites spreading misinformation on social networks. On Monday, following inquiries from The Post and requests from advertisers who also had been contacted by The Post, Google apologized to advertisers. It announced it would be conducting an "extensive review" of ad policies with the goal of taking a tougher stance on "hateful, offensive, and derogatory content." Google said such comments violate its hate-speech policies but would not say whether it had taken action against the sites. The company said it reviews thousands of sites each day for violations and booted more than 100,000 publishers - including many single-author publishers - from its AdSense network in 2016. Yahoo, which blocked one site that was the subject of a query by The Post, said it condemns racist or other hateful speech, adding, "Of the billions of ads served on a daily basis, there are rare instances when automated ad platforms serve ads in places they shouldn't." (The Washington Post sometimes uses such networks to place ads touting its offerings, such as subscriptions, and also generates revenue featuring ads sold through advertising networks.) Many of the companies contacted for this story - including IBM, bareMinerals, Macy's, Everquote and Allstate - expressed surprise and dismay that their ads appeared near derogatory content. Several said they had requested that networks blacklist those pages, which is easy to do for individual sites but not for entire categories of sites. Automated filters typically miss certain kinds of derogatory speech, and tech companies traditionally have not hired the massive number of people necessary to carefully monitor content on billions of Web pages. Some advertisers also expressed frustration that ad networks had failed to keep marketing messages from appearing alongside reader comments that might upset customers - even on sites that themselves do not promote extremist content. Google's AdSense, for example, displayed an ad for cosmetics company bareMinerals in the comments section of Weaselzippers.us, an aggregator of conservative news. A user comment on the site used a derogatory word for gay men and said they should be "lying in a pool of blood." When The Post emailed an image of the Web page to bareMinerals spokeswoman Joanne Chiu Sulit, she said, "I was shocked that we were on that site." An email to Weaselzippers.us operators was not returned. - - - The issue of ad placements has become charged in an era of rising political polarization. The number of right-wing hate sites, as well as sites that traffic in sensationalist news and hoaxes, has doubled over the past year, according to ad auditing firm DoubleVerify. With so many new sites, it's difficult for advertisers to avoid having their ads appear in unwelcome places. "It's whack-a-mole," said Wayne Gattinella, chief executive of DoubleVerify. "You can flag keywords. You can use algorithmic decision-making to minimize it, but there is no way to filter the word choice in real time." Advertisers generally have little choice but to depend on ad networks. The major ones have policies prohibiting advertising on sites featuring discriminatory or hateful speech, but The Post found dozens of apparent violations. Many of the sites where The Post found violations are considered hate sites by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an advocacy group that tracks hate speech. "[Ad networks] have rules in place, but they don't enforce them," said Jillian York, an advocate with the Electronic Freedom Foundation, which runs Online Censorship, a program pushing technology companies to clarify why they remove content. Last month, an ad for insurance company Allstate appeared on Alternative-Right.BlogSpot.com, whose comments section praised "Hitler and his National Socialists as a visionary." Allstate said it has tried to avoid such sites through filters. "Allstate does not knowingly advertise on media that provokes hate or includes threatening, discriminatory or offensive language," spokeswoman Laura Strykowski said. Everquote and DirectTV ads appeared on Spencer's site, RadixJournal.com, alongside comments decrying the Catholic Church for advocating racial mixing and deluging white, Christian countries with "savages of the worst kind." DirectTV declined to comment. Everquote said that although it uses ad networks, "We specifically require that these advertising networks refrain from placing our ads on any sites containing and/or relating to, among other things, violence, sex, racism, sexism, pornography, illegal or potentially illegal subject matter, negative publicity or any other highly explosive subject matter." Ads for Macy's, Amazon.com, and even Planned Parenthood, appeared on the racially inflammatory website My Posting Career. Ads to shop on Amazon.com appeared on a site with an article headlined "Yes, I am a Nazi," and a comments sections peppered with profanity and racial slurs. Amazon, which also runs an ad network, declined to comment. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post.) - - - Silicon Valley companies long have resisted calls to more aggressively police content on their platforms, saying a free and open Internet is the underpinning of the Web itself. With the exception of child pornography, Congress largely has agreed with the Silicon Valley viewpoint, leaving tech companies substantial legal leeway to monitor - or not - the content that appears on the sites and platforms that they operate. But advertisers are demanding changes. "[Tech companies] are struggling to adjust to a reality where the same tools that enabled them to connect the world are now being used to drive it apart," entrepreneur and venture capitalist Noah Lichtenstein said. "This is the crisis of our time: How do you balance the desire to have the Web be open and connected with a rising tide of institutionalized hate and the protection of those who are being attacked?" It's not clear how effective the push to deprive such sites of advertising will be. Spencer said targeting Radix Journal and similar sites is unfair to advertisers because they have so little control over where their ads appear. And if the goal is to deprive extreme sites of money, he predicted the effort would have little effect because the revenue from Web ads is so small, totaling at most a few thousand dollars a year. "If I were kicked off of all of these things, it would have no effect on my life whatsoever," Spencer said. Emails to contact information listed for Alternative-Right.blogspot.com received no reply. Breitbart News also did not return emails seeking comment about the advertising boycott directed against the site. Disqus, a Silicon Valley start-up that manages comments sections for 4 million sites, including those for Breitbart News, Radix Journal and Occidental Dissent, sells advertising alongside the comments. It has been trying to work through the issues raised by inflammatory content, said chief executive Daniel Ha, adding that the company has been flooded with complaints about hate speech from users, advertisers and employees. "User-generated content has always been extremely chaotic, and that's part of what makes the Internet so amazing - you can share very unpopular ideas," Ha said. "I think, however, that we've seen in the last year that there's a bigger responsibility for how that affects society." The company's terms and conditions prohibit instances of "extreme discrimination" on its comment boards, and a team of 10 reviewers makes the judgment calls. He said the line between "targeted harassment that feels violent" vs. someone making an off-color joke isn't always clear. In a blog post last month, the company announced a new tool that allows users to flag offensive comments. But the software is still largely untested. Ha said he had blocked three of the extremist sites after being contacted by The Post. One of them, the neo-Confederate site Occidental Dissent, used the development to make a public call for more donations, earning what site founder Brad Griffin said was about $1,000 - several times more than the advertisements had produced in recent months. "It worked out nice for me," Griffin said. --- Authors Information: Craig Timberg is a national technology reporter for The Post.

See Offers Business Posted March 24 Updated March 24 increase font size Maine internet providers blast Senate vote to strip customers’ privacy protection Sen. Susan Collins voted with fellow Republicans to repeal rules preventing broadband providers from selling consumers' personal data. By Colin WoodardStaff Writer Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-791-6317 Share Comment Read Article The heads of two Maine-based internet service providers blasted an ongoing congressional effort to repeal privacy protections for their customers Friday, saying it is wrongheaded and an invasion of privacy. Sen. Susan Collins joined her Republican colleagues Thursday in voting to overturn landmark privacy protections for broadband internet customers, making it easier for internet service providers to collect, sell and share detailed information about individuals’ web browsing, app usage, personal movements and internet search terms without their consent. Fletcher Kittredge, CEO and founder of GWI, seen in 2013, says, "If you're monitoring someone's web connection, you know what they think, who they associate with and every intimate detail about them," so service providers should have to get subscribers' consent before they collect, sell and share the information. File photo/Gabe Souza Susan Corbett, owner of Machias-based internet service provider Axiom Technologies, says, "We believe customers have a right to know if a company is selling or using their data." Contributed photo/Topher Cox Related Headlines Senate votes to block start of new protections for consumers’ internet data Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → The vote broke along party lines, with 52 Republicans voting in favor of repealing the protections. Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, voted against it. Fletcher Kittredge, founder and CEO of Biddeford Internet Corp., which does business as GWI, said the vote was “absolutely appalling” and a threat to everyone who uses the internet. “This is very, very bad,” he said. “Your ISP can look at your traffic and discover the most intimate details of your life, and selling that information will ultimately be more valuable than selling the internet connection, which is something libertarians and civil libertarians ought to worry about, especially as the government and hackers will ultimately have access to it.” The House, which also is controlled by Republicans, is expected to take up the measure early next week. The privacy protections, which were to go into effect later this year, would require that internet providers obtain permission from subscribers before sharing or selling data on their users’ browsing, internet use, geo-location history and other information. Currently, broadband providers can collect all of that information unless a user tells them not to collect it. The adoption of the rules in October by the Federal Communications Commission was bitterly opposed by major internet providers like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon Communications, which argued they would result in higher costs for consumers because they would reduce the opportunity to profit from the sale of precision-targeted advertising. But Kittredge and the head of a Machias-based internet provider, Susan Corbett of Axiom, disagree with their national competitors, saying the measures are a clear threat to their customers. They note that internet providers – unlike web services like Google or Facebook – have the ability to collect the full picture of everything you do, from the video feed of your smart television to what disease you just looked up on the internet. “As an internet service provider we have access to individual’s data, where and how they surf the web, the sites they frequent and other important information most customers would be uncomfortable sharing,” Corbett said in an email. “We believe customers have a right to know if a company is selling or using their data in a way that invades their privacy and should be given a choice to decide for themselves.” Kittredge said the situation will get worse with the continued expansion of the “internet of things,” where cars, household appliances, home security cameras, baby monitors, and other devices become connected to the internet. “If you’re monitoring someone’s web connection, you know what they think, who they associate with and every intimate detail about them,” he said. “When you add access to video and audio feeds of what is going on in the house, they will know more about you than you know about yourself.” He said history suggests all that data, if collected by your internet service provider, will be available to the government and hackers, and for sale. “I’m sure my competitors are seeing dollar signs, but in the long run I think it’s a really bad idea because it reduces the value of an internet connection when you can’t trust your ISP.” He said his company would collect and sell such information “over my dead body,” but it puts GWI at a competitive disadvantage against its competitors. He also said he found it “deeply upsetting” that Collins voted for the measure. “As a Republican who is very close to becoming a former Republican, this goes against every principle and precept I thought the party had.” Collins spokeswoman Annie Clark defended Collins’ vote in a statement to the Portland Press Herald, saying that the Obama administration’s “new so-called ‘privacy’ rule” had “created an inconsistent, confusing standard.” “This new rule put extensive restrictions on internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast, while leaving much less strict standards in place for edge providers like Google and Facebook,” Clark said. “This inconsistency created confusion for consumers, competitive disadvantages for internet service providers, and limited broadband innovation without ensuring privacy for internet users. Therefore, Senator Collins voted to eliminate this misguided rule and looks forward to internet privacy rules that apply consistently to all providers.” But Kittredge says that argument doesn’t hold water, for two reasons: First, he said, you can avoid using Facebook or Google, but everyone has to have an internet provider. Second, internet providers like his company collect everything, whereas web service providers like Google and Facebook have only a partial picture of an individual’s online activity. “An ISP sees everything and can put it all together and draw inferences,” he said. “If you’re worried about inconsistency then the thing to do is apply the same rules to Google and Facebook, not say, ‘Geez, someone else is robbing you, so our remedy is to allow everyone to rob you.” King’s spokesman issued a statement on the senator’s vote that echoed many of the same points. “Broadband providers can see nearly everything that someone does online, from what sites they access to where they are physically located when they do it, which is why Senator King believes that they must be required to obtain a person’s consent before sharing that data with third-parties,” spokesman Scott Ogden said in an email. He said King understands the concerns of those looking for consistent standards, but noted that repealing the rule does not accomplish it, since the Federal Trade Commission, the agency that regulates web services like Google, has no jurisdiction over internet providers. “The result will be that broadband subscribers are left with no privacy or data security protections at all, and he thinks that’s a mistake that will compromise the personal information of millions of Americans,” Ogden said. The cable industry’s trade association applauded the repeal, describing it as a “step toward reversing the FCC’s misguided approach” and “restoring a consistent approach to online privacy that consumers want and deserve.” The Republican sponsor of the bill and President Trump’s new FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, have both said that the rules are onerous, and that it is unfair that internet providers would face these regulations when web companies like Google or Facebook do not. “It’s unnecessary, confusing, and adds another innovation-stifling regulation,” bill sponsor Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, said when he introduced the measure last fall. Civil liberties groups have opposed the effort to repeal the privacy rules. “We’re disappointed that the Senate – including Senator Collins – voted against protecting the basic privacy of Mainers and all constituents in favor of protecting corporate profit,” said Oamshri Amarasingham, advocacy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine. “We believe we should have to consent to sharing sensitive information with the rest of the world when we use the internet. We hope that the House will stop this from moving forward.” Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, D-1st District, said she will oppose repealing the regulations when the bill comes before the House. “It is unconscionable that the House and Senate leadership have chosen to make repealing broadband consumer privacy rights a top legislative priority in Congress when there is so much to be done to bring broadband access to Americans,” Pingree said via email. “I do not support this invasive resolution and strongly believe that internet service providers should not be given a blank check to collect data on their customers just to help companies boost their advertising.” A spokesman for Maine’s other House member, Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin, said he was undecided. “The congressman will closely review the legislation if it is brought up in the House,” Brendan Conley said via email. “He wants to ensure that the internet remains a level playing field where consumers are protected consistently across the internet and gaps in consumer protection are not created.” Colin Woodard can be contacted at 791-6317 or at: [email protected] Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.

By: Associated Press | San Francisco | Published: March 25, 2017 5:13 AM An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google’s ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. (Reuters) An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google’s ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks yesterday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos. It’s not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising.

As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube â€” an effort that could spur complaints about censorship.

Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

Image: Getty Per the Journal's testing, ads for companies like Coca-Cola and Microsoft showed up on five racist and antisemitic YouTube videos, despite Google's recent promise to overhaul its advertising system. The Journal story didn't describe any of the objectionable videos in detail, but the reporter, Jack Nicas, tweeted some examples, including a Crest toothpaste ad running before a video titled "A 6000 Year History Of The Jew World Order". According to the Journal, Walmart, PepsiCo and Dish Network will pull all ads from Google, including YouTube, except those present on targeted search results. FX Networks said it would pull all of its Google ads. Starbucks will pull just YouTube ads, and a spokesperson sent Gizmodo the following statement about the debacle: We were shocked to learn about our brand being depicted in an inappropriate way. It does not align with our vision and values as a company. Our content should not have appeared before the video referenced or any videos like it. It has since been removed. We are currently in discussions with Google/YouTube to determine the best way to prevent this moving forward and have pulled our ads until we are confident that measures will be in place to adhere to our brand guidelines. In a statement, a PepsiCo spokesperson echoed those sentiments: We are deeply concerned and terribly disappointed that some of our brand ads have appeared alongside videos that promote hate and are offensive. PepsiCo has taken immediate steps to remove all advertising from non-search platforms until Google can absolutely ensure that this will not happen again. PepsiCo has a long history of embracing diversity and inclusion, and content like this violates our core values. Earlier this week, Google announced sweeping changes intended to ensure the "brand safety" of its advertisers, including allowing advertisers to exclude certain sites or channels across all of their campaigns at once. The day after the changes were announced, however, several companies, including AT&T and Johnson & Johnson, said they were going to pull their ads from the internet giant. The Journal report quoted an unnamed executive at one of the companies who expressed disappointment with Google's response. The company "had assured us over the past few days that our brands were safe from this type of content," but now "it's clear they couldn't give assurance," the executive said. Asked about the Journal report, a Google spokesperson told Gizmodo: We don't comment on individual customers but as announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear. We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers' brands. The events of this week leave plenty of difficult questions for Google. As Nicas pointed out, we're now at the point "where a reporter spending few hours on YouTube can spark big brands to pull spending on Google". Google frequently points out that 400 hours of content is uploaded to YouTube every minute, and, as Alphabet chairman and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt admitted this week, the company "can't guarantee" that these ads won't ever run alongside offensive content. While it's unlikely these ads only started appearing on awful videos in the last couple of weeks, the recent media coverage makes the position untenable for brands. They simply can't take that risk if it threatens their profits — because, like Google, these companies are really only concerned about their bottom line — at least not while people are paying attention to the issue. As more and more brands pull out, the pressure will likely build for others to do the same. [Wall Street Journal] WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments brettanthony @brettanthony Mar 26, 2017, 9:48am the company "can't guarantee" that these ads won't ever run alongside offensive content I can understand, from a technical point of view, that would be difficult, but certainly not once the site actually starts trending, and therefore Google must be aware of it. I certainly dont want tested scientifically proven facts, obliterated by fake, agenda based, web sites sprouted as "the truth", sitting at the top of Googles site ranking lists, and it seems money may stop it...but not logic and reason... go figure.

Twitter Facebook Follow us: Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Paid Search Content Marketing Social Media Tools Advertise When Google Exact Match Isn’t Exact Match… and What It Means in Practice Paid Search March 24, 2017 Paid Search Andrew LolkMarch 24, 2017 555SHARES 1.3KREADS 555SHARES 1.3KREADS Andrew Lolk 555SHARES 1.3KREADS ADVERTISEMENT On what should have been a quiet Friday afternoon, folks on Twitter suddenly started shifting from the traditional TGIF updates to sharing a link from Google with an update to how Exact Match works. Over two years ago, Google said “Goodbye” to true exact match with their introduction of close variants. The change meant that minor variations would be able to match your exact match keywords. The common examples were singular/plural and misspellings (iPod –> iPods). On March 17, Google took this one step further by including three new instances where your exact match keyword will not really be an “exact” match keyword: Adding/ignoring function words Reordering function words Reordering the keyword itself Reordering the Keyword and the Importance of Function Words The change essentially means that your exact match keywords will be eligible to show up under these three new situations:    Examples: Google’s own explanation follows: Image Credit: Google Image Credit: Google This is significant as many of us have different variations of our keywords that potentially convert at different levels depending on the specific function word or the word order. Changes Will Only Apply When the Meaning of the Keyword Doesn’t Change According to Google, they would only expand an exact match keyword to close variations when the close variation has the same meaning as the original keyword. Changing a keyword from Flights to Chicago from Miami to Flights to Miami from Chicago will significantly change the meaning and should therefore not be expanded. However, changing a keyword from running shoes by Nike to running shoes from Nike doesn’t change the intent of the person making the search. It’s worth noting that Google should not trigger a search when they cover close variations with new meanings. I think we should prepare ourselves to review search terms more strictly in the near future (especially if you have a large account). Stay in Control: Add All Variations of Your Exact Match Keyword I’m sure most of us do this already (at least if there’s significant search volume for the search query), but now it’s more important than ever to include all variations of a keyword if you want to remain in full control. Google will defer to the exact match keyword if it exists. This means that if you have the exact match variation of a keyword added to your account, then Google will use this to match with a search query. Only if a variation doesn’t exist within the account will Google resort to expanding an exact match keyword using the conditions listed in this article. Google explains it officially here: With this expansion of close variants, you’ll no longer have to build and maintain lists of reworded and reordered exact match keywords to get the coverage you want. If you already use reworded or reordered keyword variations, AdWords will still prefer to use those keywords identical to search queries. Phrase match keywords aren’t included in this update. Work With Your Important Exact Match Keywords in Their Own Ad Groups One of the things that I’ve enjoyed is to work with exact match keywords in separate ad groups or even campaigns. Creating these “single keywords campaigns” helps to get the data right in front of you when it comes to the most important keywords. I will typically create a campaign for the keyword if they’re very important (e.g. high volume of conversions or traffic), and if it’s a less important keyword I’ll just create its own ad group. These campaigns often generate a large amount of traffic and conversions. It’ll give you more control and the complexity increases only slightly because you have ~3 ad groups per campaign. The benefit of working with your exact match keywords in their own ad groups is that you’ll be able to better analyze if there are issues. Especially if you have a large account, you will often experience that issues with individual keywords can be hard to track unless you routinely review keyword or ad group level data across your entire account. For a high-volume account, this will definitely not happen on a daily basis, which is why I often recommend breaking these keywords out so they become more visible. Note that a single-keyword campaign doesn’t mean you literally only have one keyword in the campaign. I’ll normally have several keyword variations split up into different ad groups per match type: [sofa bed] [sofa beds] [bed sofa] “sofa bed” “sofa beds” +sofa +bed +sofa +beds Recommended Action: Review Historical Data A step I recommend anyone to take now is to go back and review your historical information. Take your most important keywords and review whether there are any differences historically when it comes to some of the keyword variations that’s listed above. If You Don’t Find a Conversion Difference If there aren’t any real differences in the way the different variations convert then I recommend you add the variations as exact match keywords to the relevant ad groups. You can also just ignore the variations and use the new close variants match so your ads continue to show on Google for the different variations as the new functionality is intended. It’s not my recommendation to do as a standard, though. In my opinion, having the ability to control your bid for the different variations is important to maintaining profitability. If You Find a Conversion Difference If you find a meaningful conversion difference in the way the different variations are converting, I recommend doing two things: Add the keyword variation as an exact match keyword to your keyword list and apply a bid according to its performance. If the difference is significant enough that you don’t want your ads to show for the search query, make sure you add it as a negative keyword. What the Community Is Saying I pinged some of the people in PPC that were vocal about the change over the weekend and they had the following to say: Aaron Levy, Director of Client Strategy at Elite SEM: I don’t think this’ll be a huge change for anyone particularly savvy in search. Most of us already group exact terms together by intent to match to the appropriate copy; in that case, semantic matches should have little to no effect. I don’t anticipate major changes where word order matters either – Google’s smarter than that and so are we. Those who it will affect are those conservative SMB’s who’d been running the accounts by themselves. Those folks who set up an exact match only account and let it run will see new volume trickle in that they hadn’t targeted before. I’m sure it’ll be of varying quality, but it’ll boost volume with volume that should be positive. As long as advertisers are on top of any potential pitfalls like word order, the change should be neutral to positive and get us to focus more on audience + context. Kirk Williams, Owner at ZATO Marketing: I have mixed emotions about the new exact changes at AdWords. On one hand, I genuinely do understand why AdWords is implementing the changes to Exact keywords. Without data in front of me, I don’t think it’s a stretch to guess that the majority of advertisers who employ exact match keywords, don’t do so in a way that accounts for all possible close variants.  This means they are not showing up for terms that could genuinely help them, and Google is looking for a way to account for this. Not only this, but my understanding is that the AdWords system has grown in its ability to identify and gauge intent as well. Thus, not only will all possible high-intent keywords now show in an AdWords account for an exact match term, but the likelihood of those terms being high quality is a lot better than if this change had been rolled out a few years ago.  Both of these factors come into play for me, in thinking that this is far from the worst decision Google as made. On the other hand, I am unhappy with this move. For starters, I already have a system in my accounts where I utilize both Broad Match Modified to pick up the close variant terms that my Exact Match terms don’t match to. As I see top Exact terms rise to the surface in my Search Terms reports, I can then add them into the account as exact matches. This new system runs the risk of muddying my actual exact match terms in order to provide a solution I already had answered in my accounts. Another (and stronger) caution to note regarding this change, is what Brad Geddes pointed out in his recent article on the change. That is, that we understand the difference between Semantic (intent of the queries match) and Syntactic (actual query words themselves match) Matching. In this regard, I would argue that AdWords too easily conflates Semantic and Syntactic with this change, and that practical bidding is not as simple as this change makes it out to be. What I mean by that, is that we have all seen those words that for all intents and purposes have the exact same intent, and yet they convert drastically different. Perhaps it the the difference in CPA between [buy widget], [buy a widget], and [buy widgets]. While there should be no reason these words convert differently (and now according to Google, there is no difference), many of us have seen proof in our accounts as to how one converts drastically different than another. Not all accounts and keywords are affected in this way, but they are affected enough to cause one to wonder why the need to conflate the Semantic and Syntactic matching in the new “Enhanced Exact” match (as many on #PPCChat are calling it). Especially when there are already plenty of other match types to cover the variants, if one so chooses to utilize them. Frederick Vallaeys, CEO, Optmyzr: AdWords was built to work for a wide variety of advertisers, from PPC novices who just want more leads to long-time account managers who want to control every last detail about their campaigns. I think this change is intended to help the first group but unfortunately may also create more work in the form of search terms management for the second group. At Optmyzr we’ll update our tools to address the new definition of ‘exact match.’ For example, we’ll add the capability to manage queries coming from this new definition of ‘exact match’ to our Rule Engine and we’ll update our n-gram tool, the Search Terms Word Cloud, to identify new filler words that correlate with worse than typical KPIs. However don’t expect a script to undo this Google change automatically because that would mean giving up on potential new conversions. For Google to make this change means that there are some good queries that advertisers seem to be missing out on so our job as tool creators is to help advertisers quickly and easily capture that additional potential while limiting potential wasted spend. Conclusion It seems like all in all, the community is starting to embrace some of these imposed changes to the AdWords platform that are happening. The close match variation implementation had a lot more “yelling” if you will when it was first updated back in 2014. As David Rodnitzky of 3Q Digital said on LinkedIn the other day: Keywords are dying little by little. Death by a thousand cuts! Sometimes I wish Google would just rip off the band-aid, but I’m sure they know better than I do and are easing us all into this new way of working with Google AdWords. You can say it worked well with Enhanced Campaigns.

Surprisingly, the software behind the lens dates back to when Alphabet’s X division was working on Google Glass. Nintendo Switch Gcam was first revealed last year when X revamped their site to list graduates of the “moonshot factory.” At the time, there were very few details besides: Gcam improved mobile photography using techniques from computational photography. The project started in 2011 as the team was trying to fit an image sensor into Glass that would “be on par with cellphone cameras.” Design constraints of the wearable meant that the physical sensor would have to be relatively small with reduced low-light and dynamic range performance in addition to already limited compute and battery power. To compensate, X began working on the Gcam project to augment the hardware with “smart software choices.” The resulting solution involved a method called image fusion that “takes a rapid sequence of shots and then fuses them to create a single, higher quality image.” It debuted on Glass in 2013 to “render dimly-lit scenes in greater detail, and mixed lighting scenes with greater clarity.” Gcam’s next iteration debuted on the Nexus 5 and 6 as HDR+, with Lens Blur also originating from the group’s work. With the Pixel, the Gcam HDR+ technology launched as the default camera mode. Gcam has since graduated into Google Research, with the team working on Android, YouTube, Google Photos, and the Jump 360 VR rig. Moving forward, the technology might improve by using machine learning “to come up with a better white balance” or make better decisions on blur and lighting to improve an image’s background.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) San Francisco • An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can't lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube's ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google's partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet's net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody's Investor Service predicted the backlash won't last long because Google is "laser-focused" on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet's stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Kirby: All in favor of voting yes on every Mormon sustaining?

The Android version specifically will no longer allow the feature beginning May 22, 2017. This news was shared over on a Reddit thread since a member posted an email update he received from Google. Carrier texting has been a helpful and efficient feature but some changes must be made. This isn’t an early step to deactivation though. In fact, Google Hangouts is still being improved with group chat messaging and video meetings. But then again Google is shutting down Hangouts API and existing apps only until April 25. Google sent out a message to Hangouts users saying SMS is moving out of Hangouts. Google Voice numbers will still be available. Only SMS sent and received will be removed. This means you will soon no longer read messages sent through Hangouts if there is no internet connection. You may need to search for a new SMS messaging app if you want to continue such messages to be sent. This way, you can view all messages in one app. If you always use Hangouts for sending instant messages and SMS, always check if messages get through from now on. Honestly, we’re not sure how this change will be better because we know some people might get confused. To be safe, just send an SMS from your device’s default messaging feature. Google has sent the following reminders. If you haven’t received an email yet, read on: For SMS users using Google Voice on Hangouts on Android Google Voice users who also send carrier SMS messages will need to choose another default messaging app. Their Google Voice messages will be unaffected and will still be available in Google Hangouts. For Google Voice users on Hangouts on Android Google Voice users who do not use carrier SMS text messaging will not be affected and no notification will be shown. For non-SMS users on Hangouts on Android No notification will be shown to users who do not have Hangouts enabled as the default SMS messenger app on their device. Still confused? Contact G Suite support directly for more information.

Back in 2005, before WhatsApp, Messenger, and Snapchat were things, Google launched Google Talk. This was an instant messaging service designed to compete with AIM, ICQ, and MSN Messenger. Thanks to being integrated into Gmail, Google Talk became massively popular. But now it’s being killed off once and for all. From Google Talk to Hangouts Google has announced that it’s fully transitioning Google Talk users over to Hangouts. Over the next few weeks Google Talk users will be invited to switch to Hangouts. However, after June 26 this will no longer be optional, with Talk users automatically redirected to Hangouts. While third-party XMPP clients will “continue to work with Hangouts for 1-on-1 chats […] XMPP federation with third-party service providers” will stop functioning. The Google Talk Android app, which was pulled from the Google Play Store in 2013, will also stop functioning. To be fair to Google, the company has been trying to get people to start using Hangouts in favor of Talk since 2013. Unfortunately, if you offer people a choice they will generally stick with what they know. Now, having split Hangouts into Chat and Meet Google Splits Hangouts Into 'Chat' and 'Meet' Google Splits Hangouts Into 'Chat' and 'Meet' Google is splitting Hangouts into two separate apps, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet. No one seems to know why, but it's happening nonetheless. Read More , Google is trying to force people to move on.

No, really. Read More . And then there’s all the aforementioned alternatives. Despite all of this, Google Talk users will be sorry to see it go.

Since they scrapped gtalk I basically have just been using 3rd party to accomplish the same things I needed it to do. Thankfully they wont be cutting the 1 on 1 chat which is 99% of what I use it for so I guess I will be fine... for now. With AOL about to kill aim this week and now this news I almost feel like I have to give up IM. I loved Allo and if there was anything I would use as a replacement it would be that but only if they ever release a desktop client! I would use it on the phone as well but majority of my day would revolve around back and forth conversations at my job which is not fun jumping between 2 devices. Reply likefunbutnot March 25, 2017 at 2:54 pm I use Google Talk/XMPP daily, since it works with a number of third party applications and those don't require me to keep its heavyweight web client or battery-killing mobile app open constantly. XMPP is still something that exists, but I can't think of another major player implementing it. I don't like needing multiple messaging services, to the point that I won't even do SMS messaging. I don't know what I'll do if I lose access to Google Chat. Probably just force all messaging to Email, since that's the only truly universal option. Reply Reader March 25, 2017 at 6:56 am I would like to thank Google for giving me plenty of warning and time for me to transition from Google Talk to Skype and Facebook Messenger for messaging purposes. Of course, it still would have been much nicer if they did the sensible thing and kept their chat platform... Reply Dave Parrack 1444 articles Dave Parrack is a technology journalist from the UK.

Published on March 24, 2017. Credit: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg Most Popular Another wave of marketers has suspended advertising on YouTube or in some cases other Google properties in what's shaping up as an unprecedented revolt against the world's largest digital media player over ads placed with objectionable content. General Motors, Walmart, Pepsico and FX Networks on Friday joined brand marketers that include Johnson & Johnson, Verizon and AT&T, which earlier in the week said they've halted YouTube advertising over brand-safety issues. The Association of National Advertisers also issued a statement Friday supporting "several ANA members" that "have suspended their advertising on Google websites, including YouTube, after some ads were placed near objectionable content including hate speech and terrorist-oriented websites" "Their concerns for their brands' wellbeing is rational, appropriate and warranted," said the statement, which was attributed to ANA CEO Bob Liodice "All agency and media partners should recognize that -- above all other objectives -- protecting the brand should stand head and shoulders above everything else," the statement continued. The first priority for brands as they choose digital ad platforms, it said, is "to do no harm." In its own, much more terse statement, GM it is "suspending all targeted ads on YouTube until Google can adhere to our brand standards." FX Networks said it's suspending advertising on all Google properties after an ad ran on questionable content. And Walmart put out a strongly worded statement to the same effect. "The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values," the company said. "We have asked Google to rectify this situation immediately. Until resolved, we have initiated the process to remove all ads from Google's non-search platforms." A spokeswoman later softened things by adding: "We have a longstanding relationship with Google, and we are confident they will resolve this issue as quickly as possible." Pepsico said in a statement that it was "deeply concerned and terribly disappointed that some of our brand ads have appeared alongside videos that promote hate and are offensive." "PepsiCo has taken immediate steps to remove all advertising from non-search platforms until Google can absolutely ensure that this will not happen again," it said. Despite the snowballing advertiser defections, equity markets aren't punishing Google much over the issue, which suggests investors don't expect major lasting damage. The stock of parent company Alphabet fell around 4% on the week, but less than 0.4% on Friday amid the lastest wave of suspensions. A Google spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment regarding the latest advertiser pullback, but earlier in the week said the company had begun "an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear."

Business News Home » The Associated Press » Business News » More big brands pull… More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott By MICHAEL LIEDTKE and The Associated Press March 24, 2017 6:15 pm 3 min read Share SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening, a sign that big-spending companies doubt Google’s ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google’s automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don’t appear alongside unsavory videos.

It’s not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. Advertisement Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company’s confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube — an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won’t return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. “The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,” Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. If Google can’t lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube’s ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet’s net revenue by about 2 percent this year. Moody’s Investor Service predicted the backlash won’t last long because Google is “laser-focused” on cleaning things up on YouTube. Alphabet’s stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday. ___ AP Technology Writer Mae Anderson in New York contributed to this story.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it John Ellis, president of Optics For Hire, was dismayed to discover that ads for his engineering company were helping fund right-wing websites including one owned by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer. (Josh Reynolds/For The Washington Post) By Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg By Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg March 24 Follow @lizzadwoskin Follow @craigtimberg Follow The Post’s tech blog, The Switch, where technology and policy connect. As the owner of a small business in liberal Massachusetts, John Ellis was a natural sympathizer of the nationwide call for advertisers to boycott Breitbart News, with its hard-edge conservative politics and close ties to President Trump. But it made Ellis wonder about other, more extreme right-wing sites: Who is placing ads on them? A few clicks around the Internet revealed a troubling answer: He was. On a website owned by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer, Ellis saw an ad for his engineering company, Optics for Hire, pop up on the screen — even though he had never knowingly bought the ad. What Ellis had stumbled on was a little-known facet of the booming world of Internet advertising. Businesses using the latest in online advertising technology offered by Google, Yahoo and major competitors are also increasingly finding their ads placed alongside politically extreme and derogatory content. That’s because the ad networks offered by Google, Yahoo and others can display ads on vast numbers of third-party websites based on people’s search and browsing histories. Although the strategy gives advertisers an unprecedented ability to reach customers who fit a narrow profile, it dramatically curtails their ability to control where their advertisements appear. “No one has any idea where their ads are going,” said Ellis. In some cases, he added, ad networks “are monetizing hate.” In a sign of growing frustration, AT&T, Verizon and other leading companies this week pulled their business from Google’s AdSense network in response to news reports that ads had appeared with propaganda from the Islamic State and violent groups. But the issue is broader. A Washington Post examination of dozens of sites with politically extreme and derogatory content found that many were customers of leading ad networks, which share a portion of revenue gleaned from advertisers with the site’s operators. The Post’s examination found that the networks had displayed ads for Allstate, IBM, DirectTV and dozens of other household brand names on websites with content containing racial and ethnic slurs, Holocaust denial and disparaging comments about African Americans, Jews, women and gay people. Some of these sites, the Post found, featured hateful and derogatory content throughout. In others, it was confined to comment sections, where users went far beyond the language used by the sites’ writers, whose expressed views fell closer to the political mainstream. Google’s AdSense, for example, last month ran ads for several companies alongside comments using a slur for African Americans, saying “hang them all.” Other Google-displayed ads, for Macy’s and the genetics company 23andMe, appeared on the website My Posting Career, which describes itself as a “white privilege zone,” next to a notice saying the site would offer a referral bonus for each member related to Adolf Hitler. “No business wants to be associated with sites like that,” said Andy Kill, spokesman for genetic testing company 23andMe. “If you’re trusting an ad algorithm to do this, this is what can happen,” he said. “It’s frustrating.” My Posting Career did not reply to an email seeking comment. The problem has emerged as Web advertising strategies have evolved. Advertisers sometimes choose to place their ads on particular sites — or avoid sites they dislike — but a growing share of advertising budgets go to what the industry calls “programmatic” buys. These ads are aimed at people whose demographic or consumer profile is receptive to a marketing message, no matter where they browse on the Internet. Algorithms decide where to place ads, based on people’s prior Web usage, across vastly different types of sites. The technology companies behind ad networks have slowly begun to address the issue, but warn it won’t be easy to solve. They say their algorithms struggle to distinguish between content that is truly offensive and language that is not offensive in context. For example, it can be hard for computers to determine the difference between the use of a racial slur on a white-supremacy site and a website about history. The tech companies have also long been reluctant to put themselves in the position of an arbiter of speech — given the subjectivity involved and the legal risk of making decisions about what content deserves to be read or not. It’s a situation that tech giants are increasingly encountering in related spheres, too, with the proliferation of false and highly politicized news sites spreading misinformation on social networks. On Monday, following inquiries from The Post and requests from advertisers who also had been contacted by The Post, Google apologized to advertisers. It announced it would be conducting an “extensive review” of ad policies with the goal of taking a tougher stance on “hateful, offensive, and derogatory content.” Google said such comments violate its hate-speech policies but would not say whether it had taken action against the sites. The company said it reviews thousands of sites each day for violations and booted more than 100,000 publishers — including many single-author publishers — from its AdSense network in 2016. Yahoo, which blocked one site that was the subject of a query by The Post, said it condemns racist or other hateful speech, adding, “Of the billions of ads served on a daily basis, there are rare instances when automated ad platforms serve ads in places they shouldn’t.” (The Washington Post sometimes uses such networks to place ads touting its offerings, such as subscriptions, and also generates revenue featuring ads sold through advertising networks.) Many of the companies contacted for this story — including IBM, bareMinerals, Macy’s, Everquote and Allstate — expressed surprise and dismay that their ads appeared near derogatory content. Several said they had requested that networks blacklist those pages, which is easy to do for individual sites but not for entire categories of sites. Automated filters typically miss certain kinds of derogatory speech, and tech companies traditionally have not hired the massive number of people necessary to carefully monitor content on billions of Web pages. Some advertisers also expressed frustration that ad networks had failed to keep marketing messages from appearing alongside reader comments that might upset customers — even on sites that themselves do not promote extremist content. Google’s AdSense, for example, displayed an ad for cosmetics company bareMinerals in the comments section of Weaselzippers.us, an aggregator of conservative news. A user comment on the site used a derogatory word for gay men and said they should be “lying in a pool of blood.” When The Post emailed an image of the Web page to bareMinerals spokeswoman Joanne Chiu Sulit, she said, “I was shocked that we were on that site.” An email to the operators of Weaselzippers.us was not returned. ‘It’s whack-a-mole’ The issue of ad placements has become charged in an era of rising political polarization. The number of right-wing hate sites, as well as sites that traffic in sensationalist news and hoaxes, has doubled over the past year, according to ad auditing firm DoubleVerify. With so many new sites, it’s difficult for advertisers to avoid having their ads appear in unwelcome places. “It’s whack-a-mole,” said Wayne Gattinella, chief executive of DoubleVerify. “You can flag keywords. You can use algorithmic decision-making to minimize it, but there is no way to filter the word choice in real time.” Advertisers generally have little choice but to depend on ad networks. The major ones have policies prohibiting advertising on sites featuring discriminatory or hateful speech, but The Post found dozens of apparent violations. Many of the sites where The Post found violations are considered hate sites by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an advocacy group that tracks hate speech. “[Ad networks] have rules in place but they don’t enforce them,” said Jillian York, an advocate with the Electronic Freedom Foundation, which runs Online Censorship, a program pushing technology companies to clarify why they remove content. Last month, an ad for insurance company Allstate appeared on Alternative-Right.BlogSpot.com, whose comments section praised “Hitler and his National Socialists as a visionary.” Allstate said it has tried to avoid such sites through filters. “Allstate does not knowingly advertise on media that provokes hate or includes threatening, discriminatory or offensive language,” spokeswoman Laura Strykowski said. Everquote and DirectTV ads appeared on Spencer’s site, RadixJournal.com, alongside comments decrying the Catholic Church for advocating racial mixing and deluging white, Christian countries with “savages of the worst kind.” DirectTV declined to comment. Everquote said that although it uses ad networks, “We specifically require that these advertising networks refrain from placing our ads on any sites containing and/or relating to, among other things, violence, sex, racism, sexism, pornography, illegal or potentially illegal subject matter, negative publicity or any other highly explosive subject matter.” Ads for Macy’s, Amazon.com, and even Planned Parenthood, appeared on the racially inflammatory website My Posting Career. Ads to shop on Amazon.com appeared on a site with an article headlined “Yes, I am a Nazi,” and a comments sections peppered with profanity and racial slurs. Amazon, which also runs an ad network, declined to comment. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post). ‘Crisis of our time’ Silicon Valley companies long have resisted calls to more aggressively police content on their platforms, saying a free and open Internet is the underpinning of the Web itself. With the exception of child pornography, Congress largely has agreed with the Silicon Valley viewpoint, leaving tech companies substantial legal leeway to monitor — or not — the content that appears on the sites and platforms that they operate. But advertisers are demanding changes. “[Tech companies] are struggling to adjust to a reality where the same tools that enabled them to connect the world are now being used to drive it apart,” entrepreneur and venture capitalist Noah Lichtenstein said. “This is the crisis of our time: How do you balance the desire to have the Web be open and connected with a rising tide of institutionalized hate and the protection of those who are being attacked?” It’s not clear how effective the push to deprive such sites of advertising will be. Spencer said targeting Radix Journal and similar sites is unfair to advertisers because they have so little control over where their ads appear. And if the goal is to deprive extreme sites of money, he predicted the effort would have little effect because the revenue from Web ads is so small, totaling at most a few thousand dollars a year. “If I were kicked off of all of these things, it would have no effect on my life whatsoever,” Spencer said. Emails to contact information listed for Alternative-Right.blogspot.com received no reply. Breitbart News also did not return emails seeking comment about the advertising boycott directed against the site. Disqus, a Silicon Valley start-up that manages comments sections for 4 million sites, including those for Breitbart News, Radix Journal and Occidental Dissent, sells advertising alongside the comments. It has been trying to work through the issues raised by inflammatory content, said chief executive Daniel Ha, adding that the company has been flooded with complaints about hate speech from users, advertisers and employees. “User-generated content has always been extremely chaotic, and that’s part of what makes the Internet so amazing — you can share very unpopular ideas,” Ha said. “I think, however, that we’ve seen in the last year that there’s a bigger responsibility for how that affects society.” The company’s terms and conditions prohibit instances of “extreme discrimination” on its comment boards, and a team of 10 reviewers makes the judgment calls. He said the line between “targeted harassment that feels violent” vs. someone making an off-color joke isn’t always clear. In a blog post last month, the company announced a new tool that allows users to flag offensive comments. But the software is still largely untested. Ha said he had blocked three of the extremist sites after being contacted by The Post. One of them, the neo-Confederate site Occidental Dissent, used the development to make a public call for more donations, earning what site founder Brad Griffin said was about $1,000 — several times more than the advertisements had produced in recent months. “It worked out nice for me,” Griffin said. business technology true Please provide a valid email address.

YouTube accounted for $5.6bn, or nearly 8%, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Whether the recent events are a mere blip on the radar for Google or a harbinger of bigger problems to come may depend on whether the company can quickly improve its technical tools to give advertisers more control over where their ads appear. YouTube has begun reviewing its advertising policies and will take steps to give advertisers more control, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a blogpost this week. Google also plans to hire more people for its review team and refine its artificial intelligence – a key step, since much of the ad-serving is handled by automation. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, acknowledged in a Fox News interview that ads appearing next to videos promoting hate speech or advocating violence had slipped through the digital cracks in Google’s elaborate ad-serving systems. 'I can’t trust YouTube any more': creators speak out in Google advertising row Read more “We match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match,” Schmidt said. “We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time and so I think we’re going to be OK.” But Google’s public statements have done little to assuage advertisers’ fears, said David Cohen, president, North America, for the media buying firm Magna Global. Even before the most recent revelations about YouTube, control over online ad placement had become a hot-button topic for advertisers. Social networks and news aggregators came under fire during and after the US presidential election for spreading fake news reports, and advertisers have also sought to avoid having their brands appear beside content that they categorize as hate speech. “Between non-human traffic and fraud, fake news and hate speech, brands are more concerned than ever,” said Marc Goldberg, CEO of Trust Metrics, a New York-based company that addresses ad fraud.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo By Bloomberg News Mar 24, 2017 at 4:08 pm | Print View Major advertisers across Europe and Asia are still appearing alongside extremist YouTube videos days after technology giant Google said it was taking steps to protect its clients from inadvertently supporting hate. An anti-Semitic clip claiming the existence of a “Jewish World Order” was featured alongside advertisements in Germany from insurer AXA, oil company Total in France, Range Rover vehicles in South Africa, footwear retailer Skopunkten and website Tradera in Sweden, Bloomberg searches of YouTube from each country found on Thursday. The video was also paired with brands in Asia — Castrol lubricants in India and Cow & Gate infant formula in Hong Kong. A separate sermon by preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril, who according to U.S. prosecutors once took credit for a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia, can be viewed alongside advertisements from Nissan in Sweden and wireless carrier MTN Group in South Africa. Meanwhile, the Islamophobic English Defence League gathers support from advertisers Total, Netflix, IBM and watchmaker Tag Heuer International in France. The controversy over ad placement, now in its second week, is expanding across the globe at a pace Alphabet’s Google has struggled to match in its response. On Thursday, as Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt said Google could “get pretty close” to guaranteeing companies’ ads won’t be placed near hateful material, advertisers throughout Europe were confronting more than a dozen new examples and scrambling to protect their brands. “We didn’t know that our ads were played in this context,” Axa spokeswoman Anja Kroll said in an email. “We have immediately arranged for an update of the filters and stopped the delivery” of ads with these videos because “diversity, tolerance and openness are values that are of key importance for us and that we practice daily.” While Axa hasn’t pulled its ads from YouTube, the German unit is using “blacklist” filters to prevent its ads from appearing next to extremist, racist or other undesired content, Kroll said. In this case, she said, the filters apparently failed. Like what you're reading?

For more info, search Google or visit Mayo Clinic at http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tuberculosis/home/ovc-20188556 DUPAGE COUNTY—The DuPage County Health Department is joining other health departments in Illinois to support the proclamation by Governor Bruce Rauner to observe World TB (tuberculosis) Day on March 24, 2017. The goal is to raise awareness that TB is still present and that it can be fatal. The success achieved in controlling the spread of Tuberculosis (TB) in Illinois is directly attributable to the efforts of TB controllers at local health departments working toward the goal of TB elimination. However, there is still much work to be done. In 2016, Illinois reported 340 TB cases, only a slight decrease from 343 reported cases in 2015. TB is a contagious and potentially life-threatening disease that is transmitted from person-to-person through the air when a person with active TB coughs or sneezes. People with TB are most likely to spread the germs to people they spend time with every day, such as family members or coworkers. Test for TB You can be tested for TB at the health department or at your doctor’s office. In recognizing the goal of the TB Prevention and Control Program is TB elimination, the DuPage County Health Department offers a TB Clinic to residents of the county. Clinic and testing services are offered by appointment only, no walk-ins accepted. Call (630) 682-7400 to make an appointment.

It ranks Google (GOOG, GOOGL) above Apple (AAPL), puts AT&T (T) atop telecommunications firms and even says some modestly nice things about firms in China and Russia. But before you rush to the comments to denounce the 2017 Ranking Digital Rights Corporate Accountability Index, realize this report grades transparency, not just conduct — and that it’s not too complimentary about the effort any of the 22 firms surveyed put into defending your freedom of speech and privacy. “We have two companies that got a D and everybody else got an F,” said Ranking Digital Rights director Rebecca MacKinnon at a Thursday-morning event in Washington introducing the Washington-based non-profit’s report. Microsoft, Google and everybody else Those two corporations are Google and Microsoft (MSFT), which earned passing averages — 65 and 62 out of 100, respectively — across the report’s three categories: governance, freedom of expression and privacy. The first judges a company’s institutional commitment to protecting human rights, as seen in things like having senior-level oversight, assessing the risks to them posed by products and providing customers with responsive complaint mechanisms. The second rates such free-speech defenses as clear terms of service, a documented process for dealing with requests to remove customers’ content, transparency about content removal and policies that don’t require you to use your real name. The third covers customers’ control of their data, transparency about both corporate usage of that data and outside demands for it, responses to security vulnerabilities and data breaches and encryption of your data to protect it from snooping. Both Google and Microsoft ingest massive amounts of customer information, but both also document what they collect, how they use it, under what conditions a government can get it and how often that happens. After those two, Yahoo (YHOO), Yahoo Finance’s parent company, and Facebook (FB) earned scores of 58 and 53, respectively. Everybody else fell below 50. AT&T and Twitter (TWTR) each got a 48, while Apple got a score of 35. Samsung earned a dismal 26. Opacity will hold a company back Apple, a company that takes great pride in comparing its treatment of its customers’ data with Google’s, did badly because of one word: opacity. Ranking Digital Rights (funded by the MacArthur, Ford, Open Society and Mozilla foundations, plus the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor) criticized Apple’s failure to document its policies about freedom of expression. When you look at the company’s often-inscrutable control of the iOS App Store and its history of rejecting apps because of their content, that’s a fair critique. As MacKinnon observed Thursday, “There’s no transparency about how it polices its App Store.” The report also found fault with the Cupertino, Calif.-based company’s lack of disclosure about its data-usage and security policies and procedures — even while noting the “consensus in the technical community that its products are among the most secure on the market.” Added MacKinnon, “It’s not clear why they don’t disclose more.” Samsung got punished for being even less open about its policies, including a failure to post a “transparency report,” which serves as a regular account of government demands for user data that has become common at most large U.S. tech firms. USA! USA! The most striking part of this report may be how badly tech and telecom companies outside of the U.S. performed. The Korean mobile-internet firm Kakao earned a 50 for its clear data-use policies, the British telecom firm Vodafone got a 48 largely on the strength of its governance score—and nobody else did better than 33. That includes such European firms as France’s Orange (32) and Spain’s Telefónica (33) that operate under much stricter privacy laws than their U.S. counterparts. Once again, a lack of transparency held them back. “Even if they’re complying with European data protection regulations, they’re not telling their users very much,” MacKinnon said. The report covers internet companies operating in China (Baidu and Tencent, 13 and 22) and Russia (Yandex and Mail.ru, 28 and 22), but the worst scores fell to two state-owned telecom firms in the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates’ Etisalat, got an 8 and Qatar’s Ooredoo notched a 5 for disclosing next to nothing about their policies protecting customers’ rights. Read More Now what? Will this report get those laggards to do better? Maybe not. But there’s room to hope that non-cellar-dwelling companies will strive to do better. “In response to our evaluation in 2015 several companies improved their transparency reporting,” MacKinnon wrote in an e-mail. She added that while no companies in 2015’s survey disclosed data about content removed on terms-of-service grounds, three now do. “Based on conversations with companies we have reason to believe that our ranking was among several prompts for them to do this,” she said. And at Thursday’s event, she noted that Twitter’s latest transparency report now features information about “TOS” removals. This kind of public shaming and scolding may not be much, but given the Trump administration’s campaign to curb government regulations, it may also be all we have in the United States.

Name: Subject: Message: Google reportedly working on a social app for group photo editing Newsby Brian Reigh4 days ago 7 633 40 According to TechCrunch, Google is working on a new social app for group photo editing, which might be unveiled this May at Google I/O. See also: Are you one of the 10 million who have installed Google Allo? December 15, 2016 Google is certainly a very big and (almost) omnipresent company, but there’s one area where it hasn’t found the magic formula yet: social media. Neither Hangouts nor Google+ gained much traction, and even the company’s latest messaging and video-chatting apps – Allo and Duo – don’t seem to be too much of a threat for rival apps like Facebook Messenger or Skype. Well, rumor has it the search giant is developing yet another social app that will let small groups of friends edit and organize photos together. Reports indicate that this app will essentially be Google’s answer to Path, a once-popular app that lets you capture and share your favorite moments from photos to songs. The biggest advantage over any other existing apps, however, would obviously be Google’s advanced yet easy-to-use editing tools. TechCrunch has reached out to Google for further comments, and while the search giant has acknowledged the existence of such an app, it simply labeled it as an experiment. TechCrunch has reached out to Google for further comments, and while the search giant has acknowledged the existence of such an app, it simply labeled it as an experiment. According to its sources, Google may introduce this app in May at Google I/O just like the unveiling of Allo and Duo at last year’s event. Apparently, instead of being yet another messaging app, the yet-to-be-announced app will be a place where group members can organize, edit, and tag photos that have been shared. I imagine it’d be something that has elements from apps like Path, Google Photos, and Snapchat. Whether Google’s re-attempt at social media will be a successful one remains to be seen until the company officially unveils this mysterious app – until then, we will be sure to keep you updated!

Brands which have pulled their advertising so far include AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and others. Google recently made a statement saying it would do more to keep ads away from controversial content, but that was not enough to satisfy advertisers’ concerns. Verizon has pulled all ads. AT&T has pulled all ads except for search ads, and Johnson & Johnson has pulled all YouTube advertising. Despite the ads being removed at this point, the companies will continue to work together with Google to resolve the situation. GSK, the world’s sixth-largest pharmaceutical company, also found ads for its products appearing next to extremist content. However, Google’s acknowledgement of the issue and recent statements that it will do more to protect advertisers has encouraged the company to stay on board. While Google has policies in place over where ads are eligible to appear, some ads do still end up appearing next to content that violates Google’s advertising guidelines. In addition to taking a tougher stance on extremist, Google says it will hand more control over to advertisers themselves. This will give them the ability to decide where their ads appear. Time will tell if these measures will be enough to quell advertisers’ concerns and restore faith that they can safely run ads on Google’s network, without fear of them appearing next to objectionable content.

Google’s quick follow-up could perhaps be attributed to the fact that several major US brands have started pulling their ads from Google’s advertising network. Whatever the case may be, Google has already started implementing improvements to its ad policies, ramping up its enforcement of those policies, and providing new controls for advertisers. Improving Ad Policies Effective immediately, Google will start cracking down on hateful, offensive, and derogatory content. ”This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. This change will enable us to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites.” In addition, Google’s stricter ad policies will ensure ads only show up against content from publishers in the YouTube Partner Program. The company will also review its community guidelines and perhaps reconsider which types of content are allowed on the YouTube platform, not just which type of content are allowed to display ads. Google assures that it will still be adamantly removing ads which manage to show up against controversial content. Increased Control for Advertisers In the coming days and months, Google will be introducing the following new tools for advertisers to help them gain better control over where their ads appear: Safer default for brands: Google will change its default settings so ads do not show on content which advertisers may find potentially objectionable. Simplified management of exclusions: Google will make it easier for advertisers to exclude specific sites and channels from all of their AdWords for Video and Google Display Network campaigns. Fine-tuned controls: Google will introduce new controls which make it easier for advertisers to exclude higher risk content. Improving Transparency With the expansion of video-level reporting to all advertisers, Google will be effectively offering more transparency to advertisers with respect to where their ads are running. Increasing Resources Google will be improving its ability to review questionable content by hiring “significant numbers” of people, as well as developing new tools built on AI and machine learning. With these increased resources, should brands find their ads appearing against controversial content, Google says the issue will be resolved in less than a few hours.

GChat launched in 2005 and served as an easy communication method between Gmail users. Google Hangouts launched in 2013 and started replacing GChat, while users still had the option of using GChat. Read: Half Of Google Android Devices Didn't Get A Security Update In 2016 After June 26, GChat will fully transition to Hangouts, Google said. The Google Talk Android app will also stop working, which means users should install Hangouts instead. “With the introduction of Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat, which add further improvements in meetings and team collaboration, it is now time to say goodbye to Google Talk,” the company said. In case you preferred GChat, there will be a “Dense Roster setting” in Hangouts that is similar to Google Talk. Google will also remove SMS support for Hangouts starting May 22. Google is telling users to switch to Android Messages. Google explained the move in the post saying: “We want to provide a consistent and easy-to-use SMS experience for Android users, right out of the box. So we’re focused on making Android Messages the primary place to access SMS and are working with carriers and device manufacturers to include Android Messages natively in Android devices. Over time, we’re working with partners to upgrade SMS to RCS —the next standard in carrier messaging that will bring features like read receipts, group chat, hi-res photo sharing and more.” Read: Gmail App Update: How To Send, Receive Money On Android Devices Google also said it will retire several Gmail labs starting April 24. Labs which will be retired are: Authentication Icon, Google Voice Player, Picasa previews, Pictures in chat, Quick Links, Quote Selected Text, Smartlabels, and Yelp previews. Google will also retire certain Google+ functionalities on Gmail, including the ability to email Google+ profiles and the use of Google+ Circles, also starting April 24.

One in four San Antonio households lack Internet access according to the Census Bureau. “We invest in making sure folks on the other side of the digital divide have the tools and resources to become broadband adopters,” says San Antonio Google Fiber Community Impact Manager Clarissa Ramon.  She says despite San Antonio not having Google Fiber yet, the city is included in the report for several efforts including 5,000 hours of digital literacy training, and its Google fellows.  “San Antonio has two amazing digital inclusion fellows one of them is placed at the San Antonio Housing Authority, one is placed at the public library.” The fellows bolster digital literacy and inclusion efforts.

On Thursday, Google announced that it will partner with Howard University in Washington, D.C., to give African-American students the opportunity to spend the summer at Google's headquarters. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP/File | Caption Loading... Ellen Powell Staff | @ellenrpowell March 24, 2017 —Though black students account for nine percent of graduates at the top 25 computer science programs, many of them never make it to Silicon Valley, the home of tech giants from Facebook to Apple. Can Google’s new pipeline program help change that? On Thursday, the internet search giant announced that it had partnered with Howard University, a historically black university (HBCU) based in Washington, D.C., to bring computer science students from Howard to Google’s Mountain View, Calif., campus. The program, dubbed “Howard University West,” will offer 25-30 juniors and seniors a 12-week summer immersion into Silicon Valley culture, with for-credit classes provided by Howard faculty and Google engineers. If all goes well, Google hopes to offer the program to students at other HBCUs across the country. Coming on the heels of successful programs like Google in Residence, which sends Google engineers to teach on college campuses for a semester, Howard University West is Google’s latest effort to expose students from different cultures and backgrounds to the possibilities of a career in tech. The ultimate goal: tap into the tech talent cultivated by HBCUs in order to enhance diversity at Google and across Silicon Valley. “Research indicates that diversity leads teams to be more creative, more innovative, and better at complex problem solving – some of the very things a company like Google cares about most,” Joelle Emerson, founder and chief executive officer of Paradigm, a strategy firm that helps companies become more diverse and inclusive, tells The Christian Science Monitor in an email.  Diversity is increasingly being recognized as key to a company’s business success, so tapping into diverse talent bases may be a strategic move on the part of companies like Google. Studies suggest that teams of very different individuals think more creatively, not only because they bring unique life experiences to bear on problems, but also because they are primed to anticipate alternative viewpoints and put in effort to reach consensus. Andrea Hoffman, founder and CEO of Culture Shift Labs, which offers strategic growth advice to a range of firms, says diversity also “helps win the war for talent.” Would Google hire you? 10 test questions to find out “With over 2 million technology and manufacturing jobs going unfilled today, it’s crucial that we get a diverse cross-section of people into the pipeline,” she tells the Monitor in an email. Nevertheless, Silicon Valley diversity remains limited, with African-Americans representing just 2.2 percent of the tech workforce, according to data from the 2015 American Community Survey. Many big tech firms are failing to recognize the talent that already exists, says Julian Turley, who works in recruitment and programs at CODE2040, an organization that helps top black and Latino/a tech talent access opportunities. “It’s not a pipeline problem,” he explains in a phone interview with the Monitor. “The talent is there.” That’s borne out by tech statistics from other metropolitan areas, which show African-Americans making up 17.1 percent of the tech workforce in Washington, D.C., 20.6 percent in Atlanta, and 7.3 percent in New York. Anecdotally, Mr. Turley finds that some firms expect students to approach coding problems in a specific way, and therefore may not even recruit from schools outside the top 25. That can leave computer science graduates from underrepresented groups looking for work or concentrated in smaller tech companies.  Even his friends from top 25 schools have struggled to break into Silicon Valley, he says: Many work at financial institutions or consulting companies instead. Forging links with Howard University, and expanding to other HBCUs – which collectively account for one-third of computer science graduates – may help Google recognize talent and access a more diverse pool of students. “I think this is a great opportunity for Google and other companies to develop partnerships,” Turley says. But recruitment is only half of the equation. Retention has traditionally been a problem with regard to underrepresented groups in Silicon Valley, explains Maya Beasley, associate professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut and author of “Opting Out: Losing the Potential of America’s Young Black Elite.” “I think there is a push out of Silicon Valley in the sense that the small number and proportion of African Americans and people of color more broadly signal a lack of interest in having these groups in the workforce there,” she writes in an email to the Monitor. What prospective employees want to see, Professor Beasley adds, is that companies are actively fixing the problem. Howard University West may be one sign of Google’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. Being involved in the program may also help students picture what it would be like to work in Silicon Valley, according to Ms. Emerson. “Tech is a fairly homogeneous industry along racial and ethnic lines, and as a result, students from underrepresented groups may have a harder time envisioning themselves belonging in this industry,” she explains. “By creating an HBCU on the Google campus, Google and Howard can change that. Students will now be able to see themselves working in tech and being a part of this community.” In designing the program, Google may be able to emulate “highly effective” internship programs elsewhere in Silicon Valley that “provide students with additional skills … and provide real networking opportunities with companies,” suggests Beasley.

(AAP) Previous Next Show Grid Previous Next Hide Grid Image 1/ Video Audio Google has apologised for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavoury videos on YouTube after an ad boycott by big firms. Source: AAP 25 Mar 2017 - 11:14 AM  UPDATED 25 Mar 2017 - 11:14 AM Tweet An advertising boycott of YouTube is broadening in a sign that big companies doubt Google's ability to prevent marketing campaigns from appearing alongside repugnant videos. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores and Starbucks on Friday confirmed that they have also suspended their advertising on YouTube after the Wall Street Journal found Google's automated programs placed their brands on five videos containing racist content. AT&T, Verizon, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. The defections are continuing even after Google apologised for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavoury videos. If Google can't lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.

The PM’s spokesman said internet search and social media firms “must do more” to stop extremist material being posted. Mr May’s warning comes amid a growing backlash against the world’s biggest digital firms which make billions while al­­­l­­­­owing would-be-at­tackers easy access to terror instruction man­­uals and hate videos. A simple Google search shows these are still readily available des­­pite mounting public fury. The PM’s spokesman warned: “The fight against ter­­rorism and hate speech has to be a joint one.

It’s clear social media companies can and must do more.” Earlier this month MPs on the Home Affairs Committee vented their fury on officials from Google, Facebook and Twitter over their failure to take quicker action against users who post extremist material. Downing street insisted it had made its position abundantly clear to internet firms. The No10 spokesman added: “Social media companies have a responsibility when it comes to making sure this material is not disseminated. MPs have already vented their fury at Google (Photo: PA) “We have been clear repeatedly that we think they can and must do more and we are always talking with them on how to achieve that. The ball’s in their court. Let’s see how they respond.” But senior politicians said the firms have had enough warnings and it was time the Government considered new laws. Damian Collins, who heads the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said bosses should face a new offence of failing to act to remove terrorist videos and manuals from their sites. He was backed by former terror tsar Lord Alex Carlile who said: “We need to reinforce the attack on internet radicalisation. If a new law is necessary to compel internet service pro­­viders to co-operate with these efforts, it must be made.” Internet firms say they do all they can but the sheer volume of material means a perfect policing is impossible. But the scale of Government anger was made clear on Thursday when Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson used an appearance at an anti-ISIS conference in the US to lay into internet firms. Terrorist Khalid Masood (Photo: PA) He said: “We are going to have to engage not just militarily in Syria and Iraq but also win in their hearts and minds and to stop the stuff on the internet that corrupts and pollutes so many people. “This is something the internet companies and social media companies need to think about. “They need to do more to take that stuff off their media – the incitements, the information about how to become a terrorist, the radicalising sermons and messages. “That needs to come down.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On ISIS Google Theresa May Terrorism Terror attacks Politics Facebook Twitter London terror attack News all Most Read Most Recent SnakesBody of man swallowed whole by monster 7m-long python is cut from its stomach by horrified villagers WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT.

The bet paid off. YouTube is now one of the pillars of Google’s advertising business and the most valuable video platform on the Internet. In recent years, advertisers flocked to YouTube to reach younger people who have started to shun broadcast television. But the technology underpinning YouTube’s advertising business has come under intense scrutiny, with AT&T, Johnson & Johnson and other large marketers announcing this week that they would pull their ads from the service. Their reason: The automated system in which ads are bought and placed online has too often resulted in brands appearing next to offensive material such as hate speech. On Thursday, Lyft became the latest example, removing its ads after they appeared next to videos from a racist skinhead group. “This is beyond offensive,” a Lyft spokesman, Scott Coriell, said. “As soon as we learned of it, we pulled our advertising on YouTube.” The move strikes at the core of YouTube’s appeal. Unlike television, with specific programming during which brands choose to run their advertising, YouTube mirrors the Internet’s sprawl, specializing in niche content that may not appeal to a mainstream audience but attracts engaged viewers. This provides YouTube with an enormous audience watching 1 billion hours of videos a day, perfect for new ad technology that minutely slices and dices an audience so that companies can reach specific viewers. That technology, known as programmatic advertising, allows advertisers to lay out the general parameters of what kind of person they want to reach — say, a young man under 25 — and trust that their ad will find that person, no matter where he might be on the Internet. This approach plays to the strengths of tech giants like Google and Facebook, allowing advertisers to use automation and data to cheaply and efficiently reach their own audiences, funneling money through a complicated system of agencies and third-party networks. But more than 400 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute, and while Google has noted that it prevents ads from running near inappropriate material “in the vast majority of cases,” it has proved unable to totally police that amount of content in real time. And that has advertisers increasingly concerned. “The simple truth is that the same tech that allows the posting of a recipe, the joyous video of a child or the exposure of an excessive act from law enforcement allows the creation, posting or sharing of the video of a murder,” Rob Norman, chief digital officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP, wrote this week in Campaign, a trade publication. Marketers have seen programmatic advertising as a groundbreaking development in media — a technologically efficient way to tap into the expanse of the Internet so that, for example, Pampers can reach a new mom on a local blog or an instructional video about how to deal with a newborn’s baby acne. This has opened up the whole of the Internet to brands, which typically opt to remove their ads after they have appeared on unsavory sites, rather than restrict the ads to a list of preapproved locations. That sheer scale, coupled with its reliance on algorithms rather than humans to filter out the objectionable content after it appears, has been Google’s main defense. More than 2 million websites are a part of its display advertising network — the equivalent of one for every resident of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. “What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match. We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time, and so I think we’re going to be OK,” Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said Thursday on Fox Business Network. While brands have expressed concern about showing up next to unsavory photos and videos uploaded to digital platforms by users — like pornography on Snapchat — the situation with YouTube is particularly jarring. YouTube splits advertising revenue with its users, meaning advertisers risk directly funding creators of hateful, misogynistic or terrorism-related content. There’s a lot at stake for YouTube and Alphabet. Search advertising is not growing as fast as it once did, and television ad budgets are still larger than total spending on digital advertising. YouTube and Facebook have made no secret of their desire for television advertising funds. Internet ad revenue in the United States, which is growing quickly, reached about $60 billion in 2015 while television accounted for about $66 billion, according to a study from IAB and PriceWaterhouseCoopers. James Dix, a senior media analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimates that YouTube accounted for about $13 billion, roughly 20 percent of all advertising revenue on Google’s Internet properties in 2016. Alphabet does not disclose YouTube revenue. “If this company is going to look for new growth at scale, it has to pull money from television,” Dix said. “Period.” Daisuke Wakabayashi and Sapna Maheshwari are New York Times writers.

Google’s Spokesman, Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, made the announcement in Lagos on Friday. He said that the search, which ended on March 23, also featured TTT’s eviction and N1 million rejection as well as the demise of Allwell Orji. Kola-Ogunlade said: “The short-listed names of applicants for the Federal Civil Service had been released. “The commission has released the lists of short-listed candidates according to states for applications into the federal ministries. “The lists apply to applications received by Federal Civil Service Commission submitted during the 2016 recruitment. “The list was released online and the successful candidates would have been scheduled for their interviews.” The Google manager said the former BB Naija housemate, Thin Tall Tony, forfeited a cash compensation of N1 million before he was evicted from the Big Brother Naija House on March 19. He said that in a dairy session with Biggie, Tony was offered the money to quit the house but he turned it down, later he got the lowest vote and was evicted. Kola-Ogunlade noted that Dr. Allwell Orji’s gory incident also got people’s attention online. He said: “It is claimed that Orji had previously attempted suicide in the past but this time it was a sad experience. “The medical doctor ended his life by jumping off the Third Mainland Bridge. Later in the week, reports surfaced that the body of the doctor has been found.” Kola-Ogunlade said that the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board had opened its official website to prospective candidates of the 2017 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination to commence their registration. According to him, the examination body, which introduced some new changes in the registration process, also released a set of instructions for prospective candidates. Kola-Ogunlade said that the bomb scare at the Plateau State National Youth Service Corps Orientation Camp sent people searching online. He said: “NYSC has denied stories making the rounds that there was a bomb scare in Jos, Plateau State. “There have been speculations on social media over the past few days that a suspect was arrested with explosives, near Zang Commercial College in Bukuru, Jos.” The spokesman also brought up the unending controversy of Senator Dino Melaye, saying: “Harvard denies Melaye.” Kola-Ogunlade said: “Harvard University in Boston, United States, has refuted a claim by Senator Dino Melaye that he was at any time educated at the Ivy League school. “The registrar’s office immediately dismissed the claim as soon as an official cross-checked it.” Kola-Ogunlade said further that in the entertainment industry, the musician with the big cassava, Tekno Miles, was out again with another hot tune. According to him, the Made Men Music Group Cassava manufacturer returns with a double bang, dropping another fire tune in “Yawa”, accompanied with crisp visuals. He said that this was another strong sounding tune that was produced by Masterkraft. Google Trends, launched in May, 2006, allows one to see how popular search terms and their demography have been over time on the search engine.

The internet search giant says its SDN-based platform enables telecom networks adapt to new services and traffic patterns efficiently. The company has already tied up with Bharti Airtel and South Korea’s SK Telecom. “We are very open to talking about our capabilities on both client and application sides and cloud technologies to carriers across the spectrum,” Gulzar Azad, country head for connectivity at Google India, told ET. “We believe there will be more engagements as we move forward in India as well.” Google’s SDN-based platform comes at a time when telecom networks are dealing with a huge upsurge in data consumption. According to Azad, more industry players need to contribute for network infrastructure and optimisation to ensure efficient running of applications and client devices, besides ensuring existence of public WiFi. Meanwhile, Google is on track to equip another 400 railway stations in India with high-speed WiFi network. With the help of RailTel and Indian Railways, it is currently providing WiFi services at 115 stations. The company recently won its first city Google Station WiFi deal from Pune Smart City Development Corporation, a special purpose vehicle for the smart city mission.

Ministers are considering a new law which would mean Google – which owns YouTube - and other social media sites like Facebook and Twitter can be prosecuted if they allow such videos to be disseminated. Theresa May, the Prime Minister, made clear her displeasure at internet companies that publish extremist content on Friday, saying “the ball is in their court” over taking action. Google publicly apologised this week after the growing scandal over extremist videos on YouTube led to a series of companies pulling their adverts from the internet giant. Google, which owns the video sharing website YouTube, and other social media sites have an agreement to take down extremist content within 24 hours when they are alerted to it. But ministers are worried that this still allows the videos to be viewed thousands of times before they are taken down. A woman looks at Facebook However ministers in the Home Office are now looking at a new law to force the websites to take down content immediately or face court action. Officials are trying to work out how the law can be enforced in the UK given that many films that can be seen in the UK are hosted on foreign websites. One source said: “We want to see them take on their responsibility. The problem with the law is in itself we can do what we can but these are global companies.” The Home Office’s talks with the internet companies are being led by Baroness Shields, who as Joanna Shields was a former Facebook executive. Theresa May Credit:  Jack Taylor/017 Getty Images The news came as Mrs May’s spokesman said that “social media companies can and must do more”. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The fight against terrorism and hate speech has to be a joint one. The government and security services are doing everything they can and it is clear that social media companies can and must do more. "Social media companies have a responsibility when it comes to making sure this material is not disseminated and we have been clear repeatedly that we think that they can and must do more. We are always talking with them on how to achieve that “The ball is now in their court. We will see how they respond.” Currently websites are deemed not to have liability for content as long as they take remove it swiftly when given notice. A recent survey in Germany found that Google took down 90 per cent of extremist sites within 24 hours of being notified. Google sources stressed the company had a good record at taking down extremist content, adding that 98 per cent of flagged videos are reviewed within 24 hours. One said: “We move content swiftly when it is drawn to our attention.” Google's website Credit: Yui Mok/Yui Mok Earlier this week MPs suggested that Google risked breaking anti-terrorism laws by allegedly failing to remove illegal recruitment videos posted by banned far-Right group National Action from YouTube. Robert Buckland, the Solicitor-General, said that Google could be breaking the law if it is found to have been "reckless" in allowing the material to remain online. Under the Terrorism Act 2006 it is an offence to disseminate terrorist material either "intentionally" or "recklessly". Google was also accused of “profiting from hatred” following concerns that adverts were appearing alongside extremist material on its YouTube platform.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals General  ⋮  Industry  ⋮  Mobile [UPDATE: Google Responds] Names Of Brands Who Stopped Advertising With Google After Ad Placement On Extremist Sites By Zara Ali Mar 21, 2017 17Shares Share Tweet Submit Google advertising seems to be receiving a lot of flak over its ad placement of household brands on extremism promoting websites. Brands like Marks & Spencer, McDonald’s UK, and Lloyds are namely the few brands who have stopped advertising their products on Google-owned sites. A report from Sky News states that the brands have done it out of concern for their brand safety. The tech giant has apparently fallen short on the safety procedure for ad placements that ensures that the brand name is not placed against extremist or hate-inducing content. Due to the problem with Google’s ad placing policy, many of the well-known brands have pulled their ads. Related Google’s Guetzli Open Source JPEG Encoder Compresses Images by 35 Percent Here are the names of the brands who have stopped advertising with Google after spotting their ad on hateful websites – Marks & Spencer, HSBC, RBS, Lloyds, Havas UK clients – the BBC, O2, Domino’s, the Royal Mail and others, The Guardian, The UK government, McDonald’s UK, L’Oreal, and Audi. Along with these brands, Vodafone, Sky, and Barclays might also follow in stride. A report by the Times uncovered the issue with Google’s advertising tool that placed UK government and brand ads on extremist YouTube videos and websites. After the report went viral, UK’s major media group – Havas, suspended the advertisements of its clients such as O2, the Royal Mail, the BBC, and Domino’s from Google websites. With these advertisements showing up on hate sites, these brands were indirectly and unknowingly contributing to extremism enticing agencies. On Friday, in a blog post titled – ‘Improving our brand safety controls’, Google’s UK managing director Ronan Harris said: We’ve heard from our advertisers and agencies loud and clear that we can provide simpler, more robust ways to stop their ads from showing against controversial content. While we have a wide variety of tools to give advertisers and agencies control over where their ads appear, such as topic exclusions and site category exclusions, we can do a better job of addressing the small number of inappropriately monetized videos and content. Related Google Wins ‘Best Company To Work For’ Title In Fortune 100 Ranking, Apple Fails To Feature Advertisement We’ve begun a thorough review of our ads policies and brand controls, and we will be making changes in the coming weeks to give brands more control over where their ads appear across YouTube and the Google Display Network. Reports also state that Google will also be holding a meeting with its clients over this matter. It would be interesting to see if the aforementioned brands reinstate their advertisements on Google websites. UPDATE: The tech giant finally broke its silence on the issue and published a fresh blog post explaining its new methodology for ad-placement. It will now be giving more control to advertisers along with ability to banish extremist sites and video channels from the campaign. The new default setting for ads will keep objectionable content away from the premises. In its blog post, Google wrote:   Recently, we had a number of cases where brands’ ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologize. We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us […] We’ve already begun ramping up changes around three areas: our ad policies, our enforcement of these policies and new controls for advertisers.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google Maps For Android Gets ‘Parking Reminder’ Feature In The Beta Version By Zara Ali Mar 20, 2017 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Google has been updating its services with a lot of new elements lately. In the latest move, Google has added a new feature to Google Maps that reminds users where they parked the car. The feature seems to be pretty handy for multi-level parkings as many a times users tend to forget the parking floor or the bay. The tech giant is presently testing the feature in the beta version of Google Maps for Android. The new option appears on the beta version in the form of a blue mark that you can tap to set the parking reminder. As soon as you tap on the blue mark, a new window opens that has options to add notes and click photos to remember your car parking spot. Not only this, but the new tab also lets you enter the parking duration and also set a timer if you don’t want to cross the parking time limit. Related Google Maps Becomes Social With Launch Of User-Created Shareable ‘Lists’ Feature As helpful as it seems, but there is one major shortcoming that might degrade this new feature to redundancy. None of the services within the feature are automatic, which basically means that you have to manually add every detail to make it useful. Usually, at the time of parking, most of the drivers are in a hurry just to park the car and enter the venue. It would be unlikely of them to wait for another five minutes to enter parking details. Advertisement Related Google Maps To Be Used For Measuring Mangrove Destruction In Mumbai What’s surprising is the fact that Google Maps already has automated parking location cards that users can fetch via Now on Tap and Google Assistant that shows the last location of your car in the form of a pin on the map. It is not clear why Google is planning to bring out a standalone feature for parking without any automated functionality within it. It is worth mentioning that Apple Maps already has the parking reminder feature, and unlike Google Maps, it has an automated reminder. Apple included the feature last year and it also has options to add extra details like pictures and side notes. For now, the feature that Google is testing stays on the beta version and it is not yet known whether Google will it roll it out universally. Although there are fair chances that the tech giant would soon extend the new feature to both Android and iOS versions of Google Maps.

After the Journal discovered their ads on videos containing racist and anti-Semitic content, PepsiCo, Walmart and Dish Network told the newspaper they would suspend all Google advertising except targeted search ads. Starbucks and General Motors pledged to pull all ads from YouTube, while FX Networks said it would suspend all Google advertising altogether. Other companies found to have ads on these types of videos said they were monitoring the situation. A Google spokeswoman did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment. A Times of London investigation on March 17, which found major British brands advertisements present on videos such as one from a preacher who talked about homosexuals burning, sparked an exodus of several of the country’s major advertisers from the platform. That movement has since traveled across the pond, as Verizon and AT&T suspended their ads Wednesday. Also Read: AT&T, Verizon Suspend YouTube Ads Over Placement Next to Hate-Speech Videos The brands mentioned aren’t directly advertising with these types of messengers, but their ads are placed on their channels through programmatic advertising, which is an auction-type format that purports to enable companies to efficiently place advertisements based on the browsing histories of likely target customers. But the discovery of their content on these videos — and YouTube’s apparent inability to prevent it at this point — is unwelcome news for a company that’s positioned itself to take TV ad dollars as younger viewers increasingly watch online video, and is about to launch its own live TV service with plans to sell ads on that platform as well. In a Tuesday post on YouTube’s blog, Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler apologized for ads that appeared next to videos containing hateful content and outlined next steps. “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values,” Schindler wrote in the post. “So starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. This change will enable us to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites.” Google parent Alphabet’s stock is down nearly 5 percent over the past five days.

With this new design (via XDA), Google expands on that by also showing any screenshots or videos associated with the app’s listing. It’s a minor touch, but one that makes downloading a new app a lot quicker and easier. So far, this doesn’t seem to be showing for all users, but out of the options Google has been testing recently, I’d say this is my favorite in terms of looks and functionality. So far this is only showing up on a single device for me, and is also showing up on the Android O preview for my colleague Abner Li.

However, the company is also working on a first party social app that lets small groups edit pictures together with the help of computer vision. Nintendo Switch TechCrunch describes the app as “Path meets Snapchat-style filters and edits meets Google’s imaging smarts.” Specifically, Google is lifting the focus on smaller-scale sharing from 2010’s Path. This app will allow users to create groups for sharing images, with users being able to edit collaboratively on a picture at the same time. In addition to the manual application of filters, the service will use computer vision to provide suggestions. The AI will also tag and organize photos for easier searching in the future. Announced last May, Google continues to regularly iterate and add new features to Allo and Duo. However, the year-old Spaces group app is already scheduled for shut down in April. In fairness, it was born out of the same team running Google+. Meanwhile, it seems more fitting that this upcoming app will come out of the Google Photos team. That division’s core product is quite succesful, while the PhotoScan app is quite clever and useful. TechCrunch notes that the company is distinctly not trying to make another messaging app. Google has confirmed its existence as an “experiment.” I/O 2017 has been thrown around as a possible launch, though there is currently no set release date.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | March 24, 2017 -- 19:37 GMT (12:37 PDT) | Topic: Collaboration Google on Friday announced further updates to Hangouts that are geared for an enterprise audience. After gradually replacing Google Talk with Hangouts, Google is officially getting rid of Talk. Additionally, the company is removing SMS from Hangouts. Earlier this month, Google announced that it's splitting Hangouts into two distinct products: Meet takes on Hangouts' video-conferencing features, while Chats is a dedicated messaging app for teams. "We've been working hard to streamline the classic Hangouts product for enterprise users," Google reiterated in a blog post Friday. Carrier SMS functionality will be removed from the classic Hangouts app for Android on May 22. The change doesn't impact Google Voice users who use Hangouts for their Google Voice SMS, or Project Fi users who wish to use Hangouts as their SMS app. In lieu of Hangouts, Google is pointing users to Android Messages for SMS. They're also working with carriers and device manufacturers to include Android Messages natively in Android devices. Over the longer term, they're working with partners to upgrade SMS to RCS. Meanwhile, Google will finally say goodbye to Google Talk on June 26, when users will automatically be transitioned to Hangouts. The legacy Google Talk Android app, which was replaced in the Play Store in 2013, will also stop functioning.

In an email reportedly sent to GSuite admins, Google announced plans to remove SMS text messaging from Hangouts on Android. The message, posted to Reddit, notes that the change will go into effect on May 22, at which point users will no longer be able to send and receive SMS text messages through the app. Google will begin showing in-app messages about the change on March 27 to prepare affected users for the transition. If you've set Hangouts as the default messaging app on your phone, you'll be prompted to choose another. If you don't have any other messaging apps installed on your handset, you'll be directed to the Play store, where you can download one (like Google's own Allo app). Related The 5 Best Android SMS Replacements The 5 Best Android SMS Replacements "Choosing a new messaging app will not impact existing SMS messages," Google reportedly wrote in the note. "All messages will be accessible in the new messaging app." Note that this change will not apply to Google Voice numbers, only SMS text messages sent and received from carrier phone numbers. Google said the change is part of its recent effort to revamp Hangouts. The company earlier this month gave Hangouts a business-focused update, splitting the service in two: Meet and Chat. Meet is designed to "make joining meetings effortless so that people can be as productive as they are when they're face-to-face," Director of Product Management for Hangouts Scott Johnston wrote in a blog post at the time. The Slack-like Chat service is an "intelligent communication app for teams that takes direct messaging in Hangouts and evolves it to reflect the way modern teams talk business."

The Wall Street Journal reports that YouTube videos centered around racist, homophobic, and anti-Semitic views are still scooping up ads from brands like Coca-Cola, Amazon.com, and Microsoft. This is even after reports last week exposed the issue and led to mass advertising boycotts in the UK and now the US, prompting Google to promise companies it would solve the issue and implement better tools and moderation practices. Advertisers continue to pull back from Google Following The Wall Street Journal’s findings, PepsiCo, Walmart, Dish, Starbucks, and GM all pulled their advertising, joining a growing list of dozens of companies in Europe and the US since The Times of London first shined a spotlight on the problem. A majority of these companies are pulling advertising from YouTube and sites that use Google’s ad exchange technology. That means not only is Google’s video arm taking a hit, but its broader network of web advertising is suffering, too, as companies are under the assumption that Google is incapable of policing neither YouTube videos nor third-party websites with its current blend of user flagging, human moderation, and algorithmic detection. That leaves only targeted search advertising intact, which is when a company pays money to bid for placement of an ad on Google’s search results page when a user types in a certain combination of keywords. Even still, some companies like FX Networks have begun pulling all advertising from Google, including search ads, until it resolves the issues at hand, The Wall Street Journal reports. READ MORE: There’s no easy fix for Google’s YouTube problem This has become a rather precarious problem for YouTube and Google’s larger advertising operation, both of which rely on what’s called programmatic advertising that uses algorithms and not humans to dictate placement. For years, YouTube has championed itself as the destination for any and all video on the internet, with loose restrictions around graphic and offensive content and creators espousing views many traditional broadcasters would classify as hate speech. This has allowed YouTube to balloon in popularity. Even when it does veer into hosting illegal content, like copyrighted material or terrorist propaganda, the site is shielded by federal law from being legally held responsible. The end result is that YouTube enjoys 400 hours of video uploaded every minute and 1 billion hours of video consumed every day, with around $11 billion in revenue last year. Yet a growing chunk of that video is the type of content advertisers want nothing to do with. And due to the current political climate, it’s become increasingly popular for content creators to make a living off hateful content that panders to bigots and fringe political groups like the alt-right. YouTube is now in the position of being structurally incapable of policing its platform and perhaps culturally hesitant even to do so with more heavy-handed moderation methods. Google is promising a fix as soon as Sunday Even more pressing is the possibility that YouTube’s business simply cannot operate at its current scale with the human moderation required to ensure no ad is placed on an objectionable video. Google is willing to try, if only to stem the exodus of advertisers. “We’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear,” Google said in a statement given to The Verge on Wednesday. “We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.” That statement followed a more direct plea to advertisers earlier this week in which Google promised it would be giving brands more direct control over and insight into where ads were placed on YouTube and Google-partnered third-party sites. The company also promised new tools like artificial intelligence-powered filtering that would detect offensive language and other contents within a video and flag it. Bloomberg reports that Google plans on implementing these new tools and changes as soon as this Sunday, according to an internal company memo. Yet it’s unclear just how effective Google’s new tools will be, and what it might take to bring advertisers back.

Aside from the various messaging apps from Android phone makers, it also has its own problems, with numerous overlapping apps that all have similar functions: Allo, Android Messages, Hangouts, Duo, Google Voice, and Google Talk. Now, Google is taking some much-needed steps to consolidate its efforts. On June 26, Google will finally be closing Google Talk for good. The instant messaging service affectionately known as Gchat is one of Google’s oldest messaging apps, having been in existence since 2005. Way back in 2013, Google began encouraging Talk users to switch to Hangouts, and on June 26 the transition will be complete and its doors will be closed for good. On that day, any straggling Talk users will be automatically transitioned to Hangouts for good, where they can continue chatting with their friends. (And for anyone who was hanging on just for the interface, Google notes that the Dense Roster setting in Hangouts will provide a similar experience.) Also part of the change will be the removal of SMS support from Hangouts. That change will happen on May 22, at which point Google will force all users to Android Messages for their texting needs. This doesn’t come as a surprise, since Google announced a business-minded revamp for Hangouts a couple weeks back and also recently announced Android Messages, a new push and name for its previous SMS app, Messenger. While we’re sure to hear more about this new strategy at Google I/O, it looks like Android Messages is the new app to rule them all: “We’re focused on making Android Messages the primary place to access SMS and are working with carriers and device manufacturers to include Android Messages natively in Android devices. Over time, we’re working with partners to upgrade SMS to RCS—the next standard in carrier messaging that will bring features like read receipts, group chat, hi-res photo sharing and more.” Talking points: Any time Google makes a change to one of its messaging apps is usually cause for concern, but this is a good thing. Google Talk hasn’t received any official support for years, and Hangouts can now be what it’s supposed to be: a modern replacement for Gchat. Losing SMS support in Hangouts isn’t a huge deal either, since Google seems committed to making Android Messages the default texting client that we actually want to use. But that’ll take two things: merging it with Allo so we can enjoy stickers and Google Assistant, and developing a proper backup system so we don’t lose all our conversations when we switch phones.

In the UK, more than 250 organizations including the British government, Toyota and McDonald’s have stopped advertising on YouTube, according to The Times, whose investigation triggered the global boycott.  The ad boycott could cost Google hundreds of millions of dollars. When asked if Google can ensure that ads won't be placed with offensive content, co-founder Eric Schmidt said: "We can't guarantee it but we can get pretty close."

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS Google Assistant can now tell you when your groceries expire Khari Johnson@kharijohnson March 24, 2017 12:57 PM Tags: Actions on Google, Google, Google Assistant, Google Home, top-stories Roughly 15 new services have been added to Google Assistant this week, including actions for IMDB movie ratings and others that tell you when the food in your fridge will expire and play you Jaden Smith quotes. Actions are like voice-only apps for Google Assistant, akin to skills for Alexa and Cortana. Among the most noteworthy new actions is Chefling. You can already ask Google Assistant to add grocery items to a Google Keep shopping list, but Chefling does a few specific things for grocery shopping and keeping track of what’s in your kitchen. By sharing your grocery list with Chefling, the Google Home action or app can tell you when food in your fridge is likely to expire or suggest recipes based on ingredients in your kitchen. With the app, ingredients for recipes you import or can be added to your shopping list. An iOS integration allows your shopping list to roll up into app widgets. Recipes can be imported into the app or taken from the community. As an Alexa skill, Chefling has been referred to as one of the best skills to add to an Echo. Other actions for foodies include Wine Guide, Beer Guide, and Food Network. The Jaden Smith quotes action was made by Matthew Gillen, a 16-year-old who finds Smith’s words motivational. The son of actor Will Smith, 18-year-old singer and actor Jaden Smith has had a reputation for saying spacey, reflective things for years. This action says things like “If a bookstore never runs out of a certain book, does that mean that nobody reads it or everybody reads it?” and “We need to stop teaching the youth about the past and encourage them to change the future.” Gillen is also maker of Computer Builder, an action that walks through some of the basics of making a computer. The Bugle Notes action is for people who want to attend the U.S. Military Academy, aka West Point. First-year cadets are expected to learn a special set of knowledge that includes The Soldier’s Creed or the number of lightbulbs in Cullum Hall. Bugle Notes shares bits of this knowledge. Following an announcement last week by iRobot that its Roomba will get an Alexa skill, robot vacuum maker Neato launched its action to start, stop, or pause cleaning. Movie Maestro gives you IMDB movie ratings. Red Pebble tells you facts about weather on Mars, while Team Nina talks about congenital heart disease. The Racing Results action shares horse race results in the United Kingdom, United States, France, and Ireland. Since the launch of the Actions on Google platform late last year, nearly 140 actions have been made by third-party developers, tinkerers, and businesses. Other noteworthy actions made available since launch are as far-ranging as WebMD for learning about illnesses and checking your symptoms and a dog doctor, slang dictionary, and city services.

YouTube now has a sound effect captioning system that can automatically identify music, sound, and laughter in videos. It's a small but significant addition to the accessibility features of the internet's go-to video streaming site, a Google subsidiary. YouTube has offered automatic captions for dialogue tracks based on Google's voice recognition since 2009. But captioning sound effects is a much harder task, according to Google engineers, and one that's only feasible with the advancements in machine learning that have taken place over the past couple of years. The problem is not so much a computer's ability to detect and classify things (products like Google Photos already have detection capabilities for images, for instance), but instead the lack of a significant database of sound effects to use when training the neural network that would identify them. "While labeled ambient sound information is difficult to come by, we were able to generate a large enough dataset for training using weakly labeled data," Google engineer Sourish Chaudhuri wrote in a blog post. The team decided to focus on music, sound, and laughter first since they add meaningful context to a video's dialogue for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Related How to Download YouTube Videos How to Download YouTube Videos After processing thousands of hours of videos, YouTube now has a trained artificial intelligence algorithm for sound effects, which you can check out in videos like this clip from America's Got Talent (click the CC button to activate captions). The work is not yet done, however, according to Google engineer Noah Wang. "Future challenges might include adding other common sound classes like ringing, barking and knocking, which present particular problems—for example, with ringing we need to be able to decipher if this is an alarm clock, a door or a phone," he wrote.

Google finally published a post on their G Suite blog detailing other changes they’ll be making to Hangouts and Gmail in an attempt to streamline the services for admins and users. Killing off SMS support in Hangouts is just the first step. Google also revealed that Google Talk will officially be put to rest — for those that refused transitioning over to Hangouts — on June 26th. Those who were still using Google Talk in Gmail will officially be transitioned over to Hangouts whether they like it or not (providing there are no “contractual commitments”). Google recommends those who prefer the look of Google Talk to try out Hangouts’ “Dense Roster” setting to get a similar experience. For Android users, the old Google Talk app — which was replaced by Hangouts back in 2013 — will also stop functioning on June 26th and while 3rd party XMPP clients will still work on Hangouts for 1-on-1 chats, XMPP federation with third-party services will not. Anyone still hanging onto their old Google Talk Android app will need to finally update it to Hangouts (who these people are, I have no clue). There was also some talk about a few Gmail Labs that are also retiring (Authentication Icon, Google Voice Player, Picasa previews, Pictures in chat, Quick Links, Quote Selected Text, Smartlabels, and Yelp previews). Google+ functionality in Gmail also being reduced, and you’ll no longer see the ability to email Google+ profiles or use Google+ Circles “no earlier than April 24, 2017.” For more on the changes, check out Google’s blog post below.

"I thought that YouTube was like TV. But it isn’t," he said at Google’s annual advertising show. "YouTube talks back. It’s interactive. And YouTube is everywhere."   Kyncl’s message resonated with advertisers. Gross ad revenue at YouTube soared from roughly $4 billion in 2013 to $11 billion last year, brokerage firm Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. estimates. At the same event in 2016, Chief Executive Officer Susan Wojcicki boasted about taking ad dollars from traditional TV networks. Yet now the same traits Kyncl said made YouTube better than TV have plunged the video service into crisis. Some of the world’s largest advertisers, from Verizon Communications Inc. to Johnson & Johnson, stopped spending on YouTube because of concern their ads could appear next to offensive videos. More big companies pulled back on Friday, including PepsiCo Inc., Starbucks Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. This week, $26 billion was knocked off parent company Alphabet Inc.’s market value. "I’ve always been suspect of advertising on YouTube. There’s not really great content in there," said Rob Griffin, chief innovation officer at marketing agency Almighty. "This will dent their long-term prospect of making YouTube an alternative to TV." While the shift to online video viewing favors YouTube, it is scrambling to reassure companies and ad agencies they’ve made the right decision to spend money on the site, and convince them YouTube will protect their ads from offensive material in the future.  Google attempted to curb the controversy Monday, pledging publicly to roll out new controls for marketers. In a memo sent to partners later in the week, Google described more detailed changes, including a new video verification process, long sought by advertisers, and a staff hotline dedicated to brand safety. Another feature Google promised will use machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to flag suspect videos. The new approach would now yank ads if offensive language appeared on a T-shirt in a video, for instance, something that didn’t happen before, according to the memo. Google aims to implement most of the changes by Sunday, according to the memo, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday. Even if the company meets that deadline, it may struggle to solve the issue. While TV companies have almost total control over what appears on a given channel, creating a safe space for brands, YouTube opens itself up to anyone who wants to post a video. Advertisers often buy ads across the whole site, or large groups of popular videos, instead of buying ads for a specific channel. The company has safeguards to block offensive content, but the volume of video being uploaded is too great to identify every infringing video. YouTube warned as much in its memo. Forthcoming changes "should give [advertisers] confidence that their ads will not appear against inappropriate content," the memo read, "albeit with the volume of content involved this can never be 100% guaranteed." The company noted that four of the forty-eight videos highlighted by news outlets over the past month would, even under the new policies, not automatically disable ads. YouTube decided the four remaining videos, which had religious and political content, did not violate its policies. But it said new tools will help advertisers choose whether their ads run alongside such content. "What they have done clearly is not enough," said Paul Verna, an analyst with EMarketer. "They must sit down with advertisers and literally show them how they are changing these algorithms." The duration and magnitude of the uproar surprised most media partners and some agency executives given that YouTube has never been able to guarantee against ads appearing next to inflammatory videos. Yet brands are acutely sensitive at a moment of political upheaval in the U.S., and Europe. They’re opportunistic too. Advertisers are now urging Google to let outside companies track issues like safe content, measurement and fraudulent ads on YouTube, according to David Cohen, North American president for Magna Global. Google mostly handles this in-house currently. With traditional TV, Nielsen Holdings Plc surveys households’ TV viewing habits and extrapolates this to tell advertisers and TV networks how many people watched shows. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up In its memo to advertisers this week, Google said it will offer detailed reporting at the level of specific videos and YouTube channels. That includes "Google Preferred," a premium service that lets advertisers pair their ads with top-performing videos. One industry executive said this is an important change giving more advertisers more insight into where their ads run. The person didn’t want to be identified talking about a private memo. Google also said in the memo that YouTube customers will able to hire "vendors to verify the safety" of ad placements. Advertisers think they have more leverage now because they are negotiating new deals with Google ahead of an annual ad industry sales process known as Upfronts, which usually happen in late May. One of the biggest concerns among YouTube executives right now is how the video site will be perceived and treated at this year’s event, according to a person familiar with their thinking. Advertisers have long bemoaned the lack of information they get from YouTube and are seizing an opportunity to extract a bit more, said James Cakmak, an analyst with Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. "It’s a power struggle. If you see an opening against Google, you take it," he added. However, it’s a struggle that YouTube may ultimately win, because the power in digital advertising ultimately rests with who controls the most viewers. And people are watching more online and less on traditional TV. "The stakes have never been higher in the competition between legacy TV players and digital," Magna’s Cohen said. "But linear television is an eroding asset." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Jigsaw, a research arm of Google parent company Alphabet Inc., says that free and fair elections depend on access to information. . To ensure such access, Jigsaw says, sites for news, human rights and election monitoring need to be protected from cyberattacks. Jigsaw’s suite of tools, called Protect Your Election, is mostly a repackaging of existing tools: Project Shield will help websites guard against denial-of-service attacks, in which hackers flood sites with so much traffic that legitimate visitors can’t get through. Users of Project Shield will be tapping technology and servers that Google already uses to protect its own sites from such attacks. Password Alert is software that people can add to Chrome browsers to warn them when they try to enter their Google password on another site, often a sign of a phishing attempt. 2-Step Verification helps beef up security beyond passwords by requiring a second access code, such as a text sent to a verified cellphone. Though Jigsaw directs users to turn this on for Google accounts, most major rivals offer similar protections, too. “This is as much an occasion to have a conversation about digital security as it is putting all the tools in one place,” Jigsaw spokesman Dan Keyserling said. While the tools can be useful to a variety of groups and individuals, Jigsaw says it is focusing on elections because cyberattacks often increase against news organizations and election information sites around election time. In particular, Jigsaw wants to help sites deploy the tools ahead of the French presidential elections, which begin April 23. The tools are free, though Project Shield is limited to news organizations, individual journalists, human-rights groups and election-monitoring organizations. It’s not known whether the tools might have prevented some of the high-profile attacks in the past, including the theft of emails from Democratic Party computers during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The tools do not directly address such break-ins, but they could help guard against password stealing, a common precursor to break-ins.

Google's Ripping Text Messages Out of Hangouts, But You Have Options The search giant wants Hangouts to become a Slack-like chat app for teams, and is consequently stripping out features intended for everyday people. Google threw the Android user base for a loop on Thursday when it announced in an email sent to GSuite administrators that starting on May 22, the Hangouts app would no longer be supporting carrier SMS. The app will still allow Google Voice users to send and receive SMS messages, but in the long run, this appears to be a direct follow-up to the reveal earlier in the month that Hangouts is going to pivot towards being a Slack competitor. The writing had seemingly been on the wall for a while, though: This move comes 14 months after Google started encouraging Hangouts users to switch to Android Messages for SMS and eight months after Hangouts removed its support for merged SMS and Hangouts chats with the same person. In light of this news, what's a Hangouts devotee to do? Well, you have a few obvious options (not even counting the one that you may have from your OEM): As noted, there's Google's Android Messages (formerly Google Messenger). It has the most similar design language to Hangouts, although it does make the curious choice to theme a given thread based on the dominant color in the contact's avatar. In spite of that key difference, though, if you like the look of Hangouts, you won't really get any closer than this. Facebook's Messenger is an app you probably have already, and you can seamlessly integrate SMS into it. Like the current iteration of Hangouts, it doesn't merge threads between the same contact via both protocols, but for most people, this may actually be the best option. Why? It's probably on your phone already, and you can just drag it to your dock where you probably have Hangouts now and move Hangouts to the spot on your home screen occupied by Messenger. Signal Private Messenger is best known for its own encrypted messaging service, but you can also use it for SMS. Like Messenger, it may benefit from the "already on your phone" factor. Chomp SMS is notable for having the same default color scheme as Hangouts with the same basic design as well... but it's also heavily customizable. If the design of the app is what really matters to you, Chomp SMS is perfect.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search What Is Google On.Here, and How Do I Set It Up? Google Wi-Fi is similar to other mesh Wi-Fi systems, but one big feature separates it from the pack: Google On.Here. What Is On.Here? In the simplest of terms, On.Here is a web interface that you can access in order to control smarthome devices without needing an app or even signing up for an account. Anyone who is connected to your Google Wi-Fi network (even guests) can type “On.Here” into their web browser of choice (either on a phone, tablet, or computer) and instantly control smarthome devices. Unfortunately, only Philips Hue lights are supported right now, and the features aren’t incredible or anything, but it’s at least a quick and easy way for others in the house to control the lights. Hopefully other devices will be added by Google soon. How to Set Up On.Here Before we start, make sure that you’re connected to your Google Wi-Fi network and that your Philips Hue Bridge is connected to a Google Wi-Fi unit via ethernet. To set this up, you won’t actually do it from the Google Wi-Fi app, but from the web browser. So open up your web browser of choice and go to On.Here. Once there, you’ll get to a screen that will allow you to pair your Philips Hue Bridge. Tap on “Pair” in the lower-right corner. Next, press the big round button on the top of the Hue Bridge, as instructed. Give it a few moments and eventually the Hue Bridge will successfully pair with your Google Wi-Fi network. Hit “Done” in the bottom-right corner of the screen. You’ll then be taken to the main On.Here screen, where you’ll see all of your Philips Hue lights listed. Scroll down and tap on a light that you want to control. A new screen will pop up that lets you turn the light on and off by tapping on the round button in the center. You can also tap, hold, and drag on the outer ring to adjust the light’s brightness. Unfortunately, if you set up different rooms from within the Philips Hue app, they won’t appear in On.Here—Hue lights will only show up as individual bulbs, but you can tap on “All Lights” at the top to control all of the Hue lights at once. As we mentioned, it’s not that feature-packed right now, and only Philips Hue is supported at the moment. Hopefully, On.Here continues to grow and more smarthome devices are supported in the near future.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Add Your Google Calendar to the Calendar on macOS Google Calendar was the first truly great web-based calendar, and is the default calendar of millions of people to this day. But if you’re a Mac user, you probably don’t want to manage your calendar in a web browser, using an ugly user interface, like some kind of digital peasant. RELATED ARTICLE How to Add Your Gmail, Contacts, and Google Calendar to Your iPhone or iPad No, if you’re a Mac user, you want to use the beautiful calendar that comes with macOS, so you can get native Mac notifications for appointments and other integrations. As it turns out, you can easily add your Google Calendar to macOS’ Calendar app, so it will sync almost instantly. If you’ve already set up Google Calendar to sync with your iPhone, you should absolutely set it up to sync with your Mac too, so all of your appointments show up everywhere. First, open System Preferences, and head to “Internet Accounts.” There’s a chance your Google account is already here; check the accounts in the left panel and see. If not, click “Google” to add a new Google account. A pop-up will allow you to sign into your Google account, just like you would in your browser. Google’s two-factor authentication is supported, which is essential. Once your signed in, you’ll be asked which services you want to connect to your Google account. In my case, I only want the Calendar enabled, but feel free to check or uncheck other things if you’d like. Now, let’s head to the Calendar application! You should see your new account in the sidebar, and if you head to Calendar > Preferences in the menu bar, you can configure how often your new account refreshes. There’s a chance things aren’t quite working at this point, so here are a few troubleshooting tips: If your account shows up but your calendars do not, I recommend restarting your Mac. I’m sure there’s a more targeted way to solve the issue, but restarting is what worked for me. If you’ve added sports schedules, weather, and TV listings to your Google Calendar, or need to see calendars other users have shared with you, make sure you head to the Delegations tab. That’s where you can enable those calendar. If some of your calendars aren’t showing up in the Delegations tab, head to https://calendar.google.com/calendar/syncselect in your browser and enable all the calendars you want to use. You should now see your Google Calendar in your Mac’s Calendar app. Test it by adding some appointments and seeing if they sync. Then, enjoy!

Droid Life Menu Skip to content Home Topics Accessories Apps Beginners’ Guide Contests Deals News Polls Reviews Root Videos Podcast Deals Contact Search Post navigation Previous StoryGoogle Releases More Details on the Death of SMS in Hangouts Next StoryThe Droid Life Show: Episode 137 – Android O! by Tim-o-tato on Mar 24, 2017 @timotato News Home Share this Story Google Activates Server-Side Change to Somehow Address Pixel’s Bluetooth Issues According to a post on the Google Product Forums, a fix on Google’s servers has been issued, one that will hopefully address the variety of Bluetooth-related issues reported by many, many Pixel device owners.  If you haven’t heard of this select issue, be you a Pixel owner or not, just know that many owners have reported the Bluetooth function on their Pixel device will randomly disable itself at any given time. There has been no set pattern as to why it automatically disables, it just does. The problem has been baffling forum members for a solid month at this point. This fix is aimed at addressing this particular issue. Now, if you are going to ask how a server-side change is going to fix your Pixel’s Bluetooth issue, don’t ask me, and apparently, don’t ask the Google employees on the forum. According to Paul, who is a Googler, “I’m not an engineer so I’m not fluent on the technical details.” All we know is that this server-side change is supposed to correct the issues. Given this is a server-side change, Pixel and Pixel XL owners don’t need to download or change anything. However, a few Pixel owners already stated that they see no changes (Bluetooth still broken), but that a data wipe of the Google Play Services app from the Settings menu may essentially reset the connectivity and fix the problems. Provided we have had no issues on our Pixel phones, we can’t test this to confirm its accuracy. Pixel owners who have experienced Bluetooth issues, let us know if you see any improvements! Via: Google Post navigation Previous StoryGoogle Releases More Details on the Death of SMS in Hangouts Next StoryThe Droid Life Show: Episode 137 – Android O! Chris My Pixel XL has had 3 issues, all from the moment I took it out of the box, and all widely reported: -The screen flickers constantly when the phone remains plugged in after being fully charged -It would intermittently die with 30%+ battery life remaining and not turn on again until connected to a charger (my Nexus 6P doing this is why I bought a new phone in the first place!) -The Bluetooth issue mentioned in this article (the radio turning off randomly) All three of them have been fixed by the second 7.1.2 beta that just came out a bit ago. However, none of them were fixed by this month’s security update. For people unwilling to subscribe to the beta program, these are all still ongoing issues that have been happening for *months*. It’s totally unacceptable for the price Google is charging for these devices. SHunter replace your XL Chris I don’t need to, like I said, all of the problems were fixed by the second 7.1.2 beta. I was surprised that the former two issues were software and not hardware, but none of them have recurred since the update. It’s just inexcusable to take this long. I need my phone to be reliable and wasn’t overly inclined to join the beta program, but so far this beta has been far, far better than the “stable” release. Brian Wolters This was one of the reasons I left a Pixel early on and settled for the Moto Z-Force Droid. Bluetooth was just so inconsistent and in fact it would hard crash so bad it would lock up my Uconnect system in my Jeep. Jeff “BIG RED” It’s the very reason I’m ditching the pixel XL for a GS8+. Doesn’t play nice with my Jeeps uconnect either. panks103 I think this bluetooth problem is just not with pixel devices. I have moto x style and since a month or so I too have the bluetooth disconnection problem. The connection to the bluetooth snaps suddenly and it works again only after a device restart. Google if you are listening please fix this, other users might also be facing this issue. jon Looks like Google is spying on your Bluetooth connections Manthas Have not encountered this issue since the March security update, but prior to that the Bluetooth disable bug was rampant on my Pixel XL. trixnkix637 I’ve had 2 Pixel XLs and never once had a bluetooth problem. I don’t think this is as widespread as users would have us believe. Miguel Teran i had the disconnecting problem, but now it seems to be fixed. Now what i still have problems is songs skipping when i play music on my car from my phone . Gekko My Nexus 6P shuts down at ~20% battery level. I’ve read this is a Pixel problem too. MicroNix Are you sure about that? Ask anyone here and there’s not even BT issues with Pixels 🙂 Gekko I did more research and saw a potential fix – Battery Optimization – Reset All Apps. Manthas This does not actually work to fix the issue Gekko 1. Are you referring to early battery shutdown on 6P? 2. Do you know of a fix for this? Tirionfive https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/5klw6y/problems_with_your_battery_including_random/?st=j0s6bqhi&sh=b87faf4c Gekko thanks! Jeff “BIG RED” I want to say that my Bluetooth hasn’t randomly turned off. But it has. I notice it constantly when trying to get inside with my kevo lock, or in my Jeep or other random times. So yeah it’s an issue. Pixel XL is a great phones besides the few issues it has. Dakoziol I was gonna suggest that you stop using your wireless charger, but then I remembered that the 6p doesn’t support those. :/ I had the issue on my Nexus 6, and it was fixed when I stopped using my QI charger. Maybe try a different charger anyway? coldcc I swear they are messing with it. It was working for me no skipping or chopping with my headset. I was like yay they fixed it. 30 mins later music stops playing Bluetooth was on so I turned off headset and turn back on . Music playing and now back to chopping and skipping on music with background noise. So it was fixed now it’s back to normal m how the hell does Google control Bluetooth on their end. #bigbrotheriswatching S.Ober Have not had any issues with my Pixel or Pixel XL since I got them on launch. Tim Massing ✔ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I side loaded 10.5.48 (440) on my parents, brother and myself last night. Since then haven’t seen the problem. Keith Kozma It’s not just Pixels. Bluetooth has been a god-damned mess in Android since pretty much the freaking beginning. It’s sad really. If I don’t turn Bluetooth off on my N6, it will eat my battery sitting on the desk doing nothing in a little over 7 hours. I’m growing really freaking tired of it too. MicroNix Have had zero problems with BT on Samsung and LG devices. Brandon Sobotta Same here MKader17 Either that or Bluetooth is such a mess. I’ve never have Bluetooth work 100% properly on any device (all Android, mostly Moto). At the the moment, as a seemingly random occurrence, my BT will connect but there is no audio transferred to the Bluetooth device. The only fix is to restart the device. master94 I’ve noticed that too. Moto build quality seems to be worse than others in the Bluetooth market. Never had the issue with OnePlus or Samsung panks103 I have noticed this same problem with my moto x style too… and exactly as you have said a device restart is required to fix the issue. Steven I am thinking this is a Jedi Mind Trick. *Waves Hand* Your bluetooth issues are fixed. Kevna Can’t you just check the Bluetooth control history to see what is turning off Bluetooth RDPaPa-G The best part about this, is that it appears as if the guy who put in the “fix” did so then bolted for vacation immediately after. “Welp, I’m all done here. Your problem now, Paul!” Good_Ole_Pinocchio Sounds like some pie in the sky Bullsht to me…. Google. MoveAlong My N6P (with Pure Nexus ROM) was exhibiting this random on/off behavior, especially disabling itself after a reboot. For the past few days, things have been stable. I guess this is why. Thanks Google.? tnt Google is secretly running a proxy server (to provide better, more catered ads) where all bluetooth data is flowing before it leaves the device. They simply had to tweak that proxy server to help fix the issue. /s (or is it? 😉 ) 4given_p8ntblr I’m having this issue too, and I wasn’t sure what it was. I just knew my Pebble Time would disconnect for no reason. Here’s to hoping this will get fixed pronto. coldcc I’ll check later but my issue was the random bluetooth shut off then when I’m listening to my music with my bluetooth headset and noise goes off or wind or whatever makes the music skip and chop like a cd is scratching. I hope it’s not the CIA messing with it lol j/k but yea hate the bluetooth bug. roflcopter pilot ive only had mine a week but i use bt headphones daily and always have a moto360 connected. have not seen this issue. wade_county I was under the impression these Pixels weren’t going to be beta products. Wasn’t that the excuse Google gave after so many years of making Nexuses? roflcopter pilot the pixel is amazing. hdw and software. RDPaPa-G Except Bluetooth… Brian Walker Every device is going to have some bugs, no matter how well put together it is. The Doctor Not at this caliber. niuguy I’m not saying the bluetooth issues are ok, but show me one high end device that is issue free. truename I dunno. My LG v10 before and v20 now have no Bluetooth issues at all. Rock solid. I do not turn it off/on either. Just works. Car head unit, BT headsets etc. I am not sure why the Pixel should be held to a lower standard, ESPECIALLY since it’s a more expensive phone. Brian Walker I’m not holding it to a lower standard at all, I’m just saying sometimes things aren’t perfect. Remember the iPhone 4 and antennagate? Even with that HUGE problem, it was still one of the best phones of that year. The Doctor It’s amazing until it falls into a puddle. trevorsalienarms You and I have very different definitions of “amazing”. Charles I’m still affected, both on my Pixel and Nexus 5x, very annoying that you don’t know when it’ll decide to drop, and especially with my Android Wear watch losing connection… macewank Misleading headline. This doesn’t fix “issues”, it fixes the issue that was causing BT to sporadically turn off at random times. bose301s Not just a Pixel issue, N6P has had the same issue. Ryan still nothing for the bluetooth volume issue that has been around since dec of 2015 and still has an issue with pixels as well. Hayden7200 What issue is that? roflcopter pilot i dont have any bt issues. volume or disconnects. PoisonApple31 Please remind us of what issue that is – I do not recall. Ryan They tied absolute volume to media volume in an attempt to make it so bluetooth devices with volume controls didnt do it independently. (as in the volume control on your headphones only controlled them, not the volume on the phone) Issue being things that dont have a volume control on them (or things that werent designed to change phone volume) the phone basically loses its mind on bluetooth volume and sets the output to max, blowing out the source and sounding like youre listening through a series of tin cans. And you cant control the volume on the phone anymore. The workaround was to allow you to disable the stetting through developer options but the idiots didnt give the permissions to settings to do that so you can flip the switch and it just unswitches, never saves the setting. That kind of stupidity (along with not properly testing handling of absolute volume) makes me lose faith in Google. With the Nexus you could deal with a little stupidity because it was kind of a discounted beta but now they are asking you to pay $600+ to be a beta tester. Ryan Gullett *reads article. *Gets into yoga https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8270947a30ff2eb387c0d5e920b9e8d342c69f27e3da1295658430f7dd53f3da.png bose301s Now I’m thinking I should turn off my ad blocker… brkshr DLs ads are not that intrusive, resource wise or visually.

This week, the mysterious “Google Posts” feature has made another return to the SERP, this time with GIFs and videos – could it be here to stay? Plus, why marketers aren’t investing in the hottest new technologies as much as you might think; and Google announces a new type of search product with “shortcuts in search”, which could mean big changes for SEO and paid search. Google Posts return – with GIFs and videos Google launched its “Posts” initiative during the US presidential election last year to relatively little fanfare. Dubbed an “experimental new podium”, Google Posts has since come and gone from the SERP several times, each with as little explanation as the first.

Clark Boyd took a look at the new incarnation of Google Posts this week and considered what Google could be seeking to accomplish with the feature. Google’s ‘Beauty and the Beast’ ad could be the future of paid voice search Google sparked a small firestorm last week when reports surfaced that its intelligent assistant device Google Home had delivered what appeared to be an unsolicited advertisement to unsuspecting owners: a plug for the new ‘Beauty and the Beast’ live-action film. Al Roberts took a look at the reactions to what Google denies was an ad, and considered whether this could potentially be the future of “voice PPC”. Google announces “shortcuts in search” – can it get users on board? Google announced this week the launch of “shortcuts in search“, a new means of discovering quick answers to information via a set of tappable shortcuts within its Android app. But will this initiative take off, what will it mean for SEO, and how will Google manage to integrate paid ads into this new search experience? Clark Boyd examined the new feature on Search Engine Watch and considered how it could impact search rankings, what paid placements might look like, and whether Google can get users on board.

Four collaboration tools to bring your marketing efforts to a new level Despite the hype, most marketers not investing in hot new technologies Fear of missing out, or FOMO, apparently isn’t a concern for marketers when it comes to new marketing technologies. According to a survey conducted as part of OnBrand Magazine’s State of Branding Report 2017, marketers are well aware of the new technologies that are expected to be important to their brands in coming years, but the majority aren’t rushing to invest in them before they’re fully-baked. Of the more than 550 marketing executives and brand managers OnBrand Magazine surveyed, 65% have no plans to invest in new technologies like 360-degree video, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), chatbots and beacons in 2017. So why aren’t marketers interested in these new technologies just yet? Al Roberts looked into the reasons why marketers are holding back from investing in newer innovations at the moment – and what it is they’re spending their money on instead. Google to wind down Site Search by the end of 2017 Search Engine Land reported this week on the news that Google is due to sunset its Site Search product by the end of 2017. Google Site Search, as it says on the tin, is an internal site search product which is powered by Google’s search technology, and is charged by monthly query volume. Site owners who have been using Site Search up until now will be encouraged to move onto either Google’s ad-powered Custom Search product, or its new Cloud Search. Google told Search Engine Land in a statement: We are winding down the Google Site Search product over the next year, but will provide customer and technical support through the duration of license agreements. For GSS users whose contract expires between April 1st and June 30th, 2017, we are providing a free 3-month extension with additional query volume to allow more time for them to implement the necessary changes to their site.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today outlined a number of changes to its various messaging services, including a dramatic shift for Hangouts. Starting May 22, Google Hangouts will no longer support SMS for text messaging between phones. Hangouts will continue to work as a messaging client, it just cannot be used to send SMS messages. Earlier this year Google said it plans to refocus Hangouts on enterprise communications. Google is now pushing the Android Messages app as its primary SMS client. The company is working with carriers to add RCS to the Android Messages, and Google expects to see the app become the default SMS tool on Android phones over time. RCS in Android Messages will support features like read receipts, group chat, hi-res photo sharing, and more. Google plans to notify Hangouts users about the change in the coming weeks and will recommend they download Android Messages. The shift to Android Messages will not impact Hangouts users' message history. More importantly, Google says Google Voice and Project Fi customers will continue to be able to use Hangouts for SMS for the foreseeable future. In other Google messaging news, Google said it plans to get rid of Google Talk within Gmail and replace it with Google Hangouts. It began doing this several years ago, but will finalize the transition in June. The legacy Google Talk Android app, which was replaced in 2013, will cease working when the transition takes place. All Google Talk users should expect to use Google Hangouts moving forward. Google is also retiring a number of Gmail Labs, including Authentication Icon, Google Voice Player, Picasa previews, Pictures in chat, Quick Links, Quote Selected Text, Smartlabels, and Yelp previews. Last, Google is removing some Google+ functionality from Gmail, specifically the ability to email Google+ profiles and the use of Google+ Circles. These changes will take place after April 24. more info at Google » Related Google news Android news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

A point is better than nothing but not great for Wales, plus Bale will be suspended for their next game against group leaders Serbia, who they’re now four points behind. And of course for Ireland, they have to deal with a horrible injury to Seamus Coleman, sustained after that reckless foul by Taylor. Sorry to report that the initial impressions suggest we’re talking Eduardo, Ramsey, Henrik Larsson territory. Would not recommend watching it. Gareth Bale and David Meyler after the match.

The ball then loops up in the air, and Hennessey almost makes a mess of things with a shambolic attempt at a punch. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.35pm EDT 17:35 90 mins + 1: Strong few seconds for McGeady - he concedes a goal-kick with a needlessly elaborate bit of skill in the Wales box, then half-barges into the referee in protest, earning himself a booking. Not the smartest thing he’ll ever do. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.34pm EDT 17:34 90 mins: Christie chucks a long throw into the box, hoping to create a little chaos, but nothing comes of it.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.32pm EDT 17:32 88 mins: Wales win a corner on the left after an iffy header back by Christie. Ramsey curls it in, finds the head of Bale but he’s twisting and heavily marked, and can only send it wide. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.30pm EDT 17:30 86 mins: McGeady tries to conjure something for Ireland, jinking in from the left and shooting with his right foot, but the effort goes comfortably over in the end.

Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters Updated at 5.49pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.29pm EDT 17:29 85 mins: Bale goes inches away from giving Wales the lead!

Updated at 5.32pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.28pm EDT 17:28 83 mins: Bale a very lucky puppy to still be on the pitch - he goes for a ball with McClean, but he puts his boot into his opponent’s chest while doing so. Already on a yellow, he could quite easily have been given another there.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.22pm EDT 17:22 76 mins: A few nominations for the least-likely tunes for football chants: “The most unlikely tune for a footy chant is probably Guantanamera, the Sandpipers’ hit based on Cuba’s most popular folk song. Not only is Cuba not really big on football, but it’s about a woman from Guantánamo, rather than One Liam Brady or whoever (two Andy Gorhams)!” - Justin Kavanagh “I see Niall Mullen is bored - aren’t we all - so my take for the most unlikely song melody for a football chant has to be the Bonzos’ I’m Bored, although the lyrics are quite apt” - Michael Cosgrove. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.18pm EDT 17:18 74 mins: McClean goes close, and everyone thought it was in! The ball falls to McClean in the area - he shoots with his left but scuffs it a bit, and it rebound back to him. He then shoots with his right, and that one is deflected just, just, just wide of the post.

Wales make a change too, as Jazz Richards comes on for Joe Ledley. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.15pm EDT 17:15 70 mins: This looks really bad. The TV cameras mercifully aren’t zooming in on Coleman’s leg, but the Irish players reacted in that way players only do when it’s a really, really serious injury. Coleman gets some oxygen, and is actually loaded onto a stretcher reasonably quickly. Straight red for Wales’ Neil Taylor.

Taylor sent off Well, immediately after that possible red, an actual red. Taylor absolutely steams into a challenge on Coleman, going in high, late and recklessly, and it’s an immediate sending off. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.12pm EDT 17:12 68 mins: Gunter gets down the right, puts in a low cross which Bale slides towards. O’Shea gets there first, but Bale’s raised studs connect with O’Shea’s shin. He’s booked, meaning he’s suspended for the game against Serbia. Bad news for Wales. John O’Shea is fouled by Gareth Bale. Photograph: Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile/Getty Images Updated at 5.17pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.10pm EDT 17:10 66 mins: Walters heads a cross away, straight onto Taylor’s head, and the ball nearly loops over Randolph. That might have been fitting for this game. Meanwhile Niall Mullen is trying to distract us from the long lonely path to the infinite: “Of course “Those Were The Days” is the tune Ireland fans use for “Come on you boys in green”. What is the most unlikely song to have provided the melody for a football chant? Go West? Volare? Sloop John B? Yes I’m bored.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.07pm EDT 17:07 64 mins: A scrappy passage in the Ireland area leads to the ball falling for Vokes in the area, and he stabs at a shot, but it goes wide. Not really improving, this. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.05pm EDT 17:05 62 mins: ....no. McClean hits the...well, shot, I guess, straight into the wall. The ball eventually breaks to Long on the edge of the box, but his shot goes well wide. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.05pm EDT 17:05 61 mins: Now then. Allen has a little nibble at his clubmate Walters and trips him on the right corner of the area. Can they do anything from this...? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.04pm EDT 17:04 60 mins: A corner for Ireland, and the ball rebounds off...someone, and dribbles wide. This is a bad game of football, as Dermot O’Reilly will tell you: “This is one of the worst Irish performances I have seen in a long time, and I’ve seen a few. Bring on the young lad Horgan.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.03pm EDT 17:03 58 mins: Bale cuts in from the right and skims over a cross...but it’s too strong and drifts out.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.01pm EDT 17:01 56 mins: Blood drawn. Ramsey and Whelan go for the ball in the middle, but the latter put his foot up to thigh-height and the latter his head down to thigh-height. The result, a boot to the noggin, claret from Whelan’s forehead and a yellow card for Ramsey. Ireland’s Glenn Whelan is down injured. Photograph: Donall Farmer/Inpho/REX/Shutterstock Updated at 5.16pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.59pm EDT 16:59 55 mins: Bale crosses from the right, but that’s far too close to the keeper. Were those sparks of interest in the opening minutes just a tease? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.56pm EDT 16:56 51 mins: As the trumpeter in the crowd strikes up a rendition of ‘Those Were The Days’, Taylor gets down the right, cuts back on his left foot and finds Taylor in the box, but his header is weak and ill-directed. Meanwhile, the trumpeter only just makes it til the end of the song. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.54pm EDT 16:54 49 mins: Bale’s warming up. He shifts the ball to his left, then lets fly from a slightly odd angle and it zips just wide of the post, Randolph nowhere near that one. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.53pm EDT 16:53 48 mins: Wales get a free-kick for a handball by McClean, about 25 yards out on the right: or, as we’re obliged to call it, Gareth Bale Territory. Bale steps up, hits one of those knuckleball free-kicks which wobbles around in the air like nobody’s business, but is straight enough for Randolph to gather, at the second attempt. Gareth Bale’s free-kick curls over the wall but is straight at Randolph.

Cracking match between them a month ago, with tension, excitement, flashes of skill leading to the scoring and absolutely full-on commitment. Oh and well-behaved fans and respect for the ref etc, but that is a given.” I’d invite you to consult with the residents of Twickenham about the fans point.

No chance of a penalty. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.26pm EDT 16:26 39 mins: Amazed it took 39 minutes for someone to write this email. Good evening, Richard Reed: “Always love the Welsh National Anthem, but thats the only thing rugby has on football? What about a modicum of respect for referees? What about the lack of trying to cheat the referee and throwing yourself on the ground to get the other player sent off? What about tv replays? Football has a lot of catching up to do...that said, if Bale trips over his feet anywhere near the penalty area I’ll be screaming for a penalty.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.25pm EDT 16:25 38 mins: Potentially great chance for Wales, as Ramey wins the ball from Hendrick then spreads it inside to Bale, but unusually he takes a dreadful first touch, and the ball squirts away, attack over. Seamus Coleman clears the ball away from Gareth Bale. Photograph: Seb Daly/Sportsfile/Getty Images Updated at 4.43pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.24pm EDT 16:24 36 mins: Ramsey has been holding his throat, oddly. Not sure what happened but he had a few words to say to the referee. Presumably the ref didn’t chop him in the thorax...although you never know. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.23pm EDT 16:23 35 mins: Suddenly there’s a bit of noise in the crowd at Lansdowne Road as the home crowd rise to get themselves going a little. The game could do with it, most definitely. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.22pm EDT 16:22 34 mins: On the respect thing, Alex Brown has the following to say: “I know it’s sacrilege to comment on this, but last November I stood through seven two minute silences for Remembrance Day / Sunday / weekend before / weekend after. Five at football and rugby matches. Every sporting organisation now regards this as essential. It simply isn’t. Just play football.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1 of 2 Newest Newer Older Oldest Topics World Cup 2018 qualifiers World Cup Republic of Ireland Wales Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports selected soccer selected tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports selected soccer selected MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer selected live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Soccer › World Cup 2018 qualifiers back to top football soccer NFL tennis MLB MLS Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Twitter Facebook To punish Symantec, Google may distrust a third of the web's SSL certificates After the latest incident of improper certificate issuance, Google says that it has lost confidence in the world's largest certificate authority Lucian Constantin (IDG News Service) 25 March, 2017 04:32 - - - - print email Comments Google is considering a harsh punishment for repeated incidents in which Symantec or its certificate resellers improperly issued SSL certificates. A proposed plan is to force the company to replace all of its customers’ certificates and to stop recognizing the extended validation (EV) status of those that have it. According to a Netcraft survey from 2015, Symantec is responsible for about one in every three SSL certificates used on the web, making it the largest commercial certificate issuer in the world. As a result of acquisitions over the years the company now controls the root certificates of several formerly standalone certificate authorities including VeriSign, GeoTrust, Thawte and RapidSSL. SSL/TLS certificates are used to encrypt the connections between browsers and HTTPS-enabled websites and also to verify that users are actually visiting the websites they intended to and not spoofed versions. These certificates are issued by organizations known as certificate authorities that are trusted by default in browsers and operating systems. The process of issuing and managing certificates is governed by rules created by the CA/Browser Forum, an organization whose members include browser vendors and certificate authorities. When those rules are violated, browser and OS vendors can revoke trust in the offending certificates and sanction the responsible certificate authorities, going as far as kicking them out of their root certificate stores. Google says that an investigation into a recent incident indicates that Symantec has not upheld security practices expected of certificate authorities, such as validating domain control, auditing logs for evidence of unauthorized issuance, and minimizing the ability for the issuance of fraudulent certificates. If Google's plan is put into practice, millions of existing Symantec certificates will become untrusted over the next 12 months in Google Chrome. This will be a gradual process where every new Chrome release will distrust a new batch of certificates starting with Chrome 59, which will revoke trust in certificates that have a validity period of over 33 months. This will put enormous pressure on Symantec, as the company will have to contact all customers, validate their identity and the ownership of their domains all over again, and replace their existing certificates with new ones, most likely at no cost. Some companies will likely have problems replacing their certificates on such short notice, as they might be used in payment terminals and other hard-to-reach embedded devices. In addition to that, Symantec might have to refund customers who paid for EV certificates that will no longer be recognized as such in Chrome, since their value would be significantly reduced. The ban on Symantec EV certificates will last for at least one year. All replacement certificates issued by Symantec to customers will need to have a validity period of nine months or less in order to be trusted in Chrome. This is likely to cause further problems for some large companies, which won't be able to easily replace their certificates every nine months. It's safe to say that Google's sanctions might have a significant impact on Symantec's SSL business, as the company is likely to lose customers who won't be willing to put up with these restrictions and will take their business to a different certificate authority (CA). Browser vendors have punished CAs before for improperly issuing certificates -- or "misissuing" them, in industry parlance -- but never on this scale and with an impact so large on the ecosystem. Some people have always wondered if browser vendors can really take drastic sanctions against the world's largest CAs, or whether those authorities are simply too big to fail. The reason for this unprecedented punishment seems to be repeated incidents of misissued certificates at Symantec that have come to light over the past few years, some of which the company failed to identify on its own despite internal and external audits. The latest case was uncovered this year and involved 127 certificates issued with bogus information or without proper domain ownership verification by a Symantec partner that operated as a registration authority (RA). According to Google, that investigation calls into question the validity of at least 30,000 certificates issued by Symantec partners over a period spanning several years. However, Symantec disputes that number. "Symantec allowed at least four parties access to their infrastructure in a way to cause certificate issuance, did not sufficiently oversee these capabilities as required and expected, and when presented with evidence of these organizations’ failure to abide to the appropriate standard of care, failed to disclose such information in a timely manner or to identify the significance of the issues reported to them," Google's Ryan Sleevi said in a post on the Chrome development mailing list. This and past incidents have led Google to "no longer have confidence in the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec over the past several years," Sleevi said. Symantec strongly objected to Google's plan and criticized its publication. It also described Google's remarks about the company's past misissuances as "exaggerated and misleading." "This action was unexpected, and we believe the blog post was irresponsible," the company said in a blog post Friday. "We hope it was not calculated to create uncertainty and doubt within the Internet community about our SSL/TLS certificates." The claim about the 30,000 certficates is not true and the 127 certificates that have been confirmed as misissued did not result in any consumer harm, Symantec said, adding that the relationship with the partner responsible for the incident has been terminated and that its entire RA program has been discontinued. "While all major CAs have experienced SSL/TLS certificate mis-issuance events, Google has singled out the Symantec Certificate Authority in its proposal even though the mis-issuance event identified in Google’s blog post involved several CAs," Symantec said. The company will work to minimize any potential disruption caused by Google's proposal if it goes forward, but is open to discussing the matter with Google and finding a mutually agreed-on solution. Meanwhile, Mozilla, which manages its own root certificate program, is also considering sanctions for Symantec and might have to align them with Google's. "Now that Google have announced their action, it is unavoidable to note that it can be preferable for two root stores considering action against a CA to take broadly parallel approaches, so that the CA is not doubly penalised for the same actions," Mozilla's Gervase Markham wrote on the organization's security policy mailing list. However, Markham noted that Google's plan is "at the strong end" of the options he was considering and that calibrating the level of response, which has to take into account previous precedents and sanctions against other CAs, is a difficult process. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Downloading all your apps from the Google Play store -- where software is vetted – is perhaps the best advice. But that doesn’t mean Google Play is perfect. Security researchers do find new Android malware lurking on Google’s official app store. That’s because hackers are coming up with sneaky ways to infiltrate the platform, despite the vetting processes that protect it. "Eventually, every wall can be breached," said Daniel Padon, a researcher at mobile security provider Check Point. To be sure, most Android users will probably never encounter malware on the Google Play store. Last year, the amount of malicious software that reached the platform amounted to only 0.16 percent of all apps, according to a new report from Google. That's contributed to relatively tiny malware infection rates across the 1.4 billion Android devices in use today. But when a bad app does slip in to the Play store, it can spread. Check Point has been among the security firms on the watch for new android malware. Earlier this year, it uncovered over 20 apps on the Google Play store that contained malicious coding designed to generate fraudulent ad revenue for its creators. The infected software was downloaded several million times. Months before, Check Point found another malware strain that was embedded in dozens of different apps on the store. The malware was designed to enslave devices in a botnet and appeared to infect between 500,000 and 2 million devices. Trend Micro Android malware called DressCode spread through dozens of apps on Google Play last year. So how does the malware get in? Every app that goes through Google Play is first scanned for any harmful behavior, which includes checking the coding and running it in a virtual environment. But even so, malicious processes can be tricky to detect, Padon said. For instance, hackers will incorporate a "dropper" into a seemingly benign app. The dropper will act as a time-bomb, staying silent but downloading additional malware at a later time. In other cases, hackers have been found hiding malicious coding by using encryption, surrounding it with meaningless commands, or designing the harmful processes to remain inactive when run on a virtual machine. Padon said the internet giant could be doing more to vet apps. The problem, he claims, is that Google relies too much on automated testing to root out the problem. "It might be the strongest behavioral analysis engine on the planet," Padon said. But testing each app on a real, human-operated device is still the best way to detect malware, he said. Google didn’t comment on this story. However, it’s latest Android security report, published this week, does say: "no review process is perfect." Each month, the Play store will add 40,000 or more apps, according to AppBrain. Managing that business while keeping the software malware-free is no easy task. Automated testing is the best bet to scan all those apps in a time-efficient way. Nevertheless, the security of Android has often been compared to Apple’s iOS, and the result hasn’t always been favorable. Unlike iOS, which is under the control of Apple, the Android operating system is fragmented across numerous handset vendors, some of which struggle to keep the software securely patched. That’s made Android, and the Google Play store, worthwhile targets for hackers. "Since most users expect the apps in Google Play to be clean, they’re left vulnerable, making it easy for the malware to infect a massive number of users at once," said Rowland Yu, a researcher with security firm Sophos. In the past two years, there have been more than two dozen malware strains found slipping into the Google Play store, according to his research. To try and popularize the malware, hackers will make them look like games, utility apps like energy savers, or drum up fake reviews for them. Fortunately, when Google detects any malware, it will quickly pull the apps from the store, and sometimes ban the developers involved, Yu said. But he doesn’t see an end to this cat and mouse game. Like Padon, Yu points to machine testing. "Google heavily relies on machines to test and review the safety and security of apps," he said. "Only a small number of suspicious apps are actually handed over for human review." Google Install rates for potentially harmful applications and unwanted software on Android devices are higher when users download from third-party app stores, according to Google. However, even as malware occasionally slips by, Google is making progress at detecting it faster once it's downloaded, in part with a feature in Android devices called "Verify Apps." It will scan the software over a phone to make sure the apps are behaving safely. If they aren't, the security feature can have the offending apps removed. "Verify Apps conducted 750 million daily checks in 2016," Google’s security researchers said in a blog post. This helped the company reduce malicious app installation last year. Andrew Blaich, a security researcher at mobile security firm Lookout, said the malware situation on Google Play isn’t the pandemic that can be found on some third-party Android app stores, which often do less vetting. "The safest assurance you have to minimize your chance of malware on your Android device is to use the official Google Play store," he said. Security researchers also advise users to always look at the user reviews for an app. Bad reviews can be a sign that the app is malicious in some way. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

It’s one of the most popular games on Android and iOS, with good reason. It’s extremely fun and very addicting. However, occasionally users run into problems. Like changing their name, transferring a village or switching to a new device. We get asked a lot of questions about Clash. From transferring the game from an iPhone to an Android tablet, switching phones, connection problems, lost villages and more. There are countless problems that can easily be fixed, or otherwise solved with the help of Clash of Clans support. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Typically users don’t run into actual in-game problems. Instead, most of the questions being asked in forums are about minor things. However, there are still occasional bugs or problems you could face. The first stop for users is the official Clash of Clans support forum. Then continue on for more details and help with some potential Clash of Clans problems. With millions and millions of players on both Android and iOS, this game has its share of problems. The biggest concern for most comes from a lost village. With that said we’ll start with always backing up your Clash of Clans account or village. This can be done with Game Center, or Google+ on both platforms. Among other ways. Additionally, in January of 2017 the developers announced they are ending support for any device running iOS 5 or older. This doesn’t apply to most players, but if it does, learn more details here. Update your device or transfer your village before it’s too late. How to Backup Clash of Clans First things first, gamers should always tie Clash of Clans to either Game Center on iPhone and iPad, or use Google+ and Google Games on Android. This is a crucial step that ties the game to your Apple ID or Gmail. Perfect in case of loss, theft, damage to a device, or other situations. Start by opening Clash of Clans and hitting the settings button, which are three gear-shaped icons in a box near the bottom right. This is the main settings menu. In the middle and bottom is the important stuff. From transferring the game to another device, connecting to Facebook, or tying your game to Google or Apple’s Game Center. Click the bottom middle option and connect to Google Play, or the bottom for Game Center. This ensures you’ll always be able to recover your game. I’ve connected to Google+ with my gmail account. No matter what Android device I have, I can download Clash of Clans, connect to Google, and it will automatically transfer my entire village in seconds. I have the same village on more than one phone, and two different Android tablets. Read: Clash of Clans Update Problems Frustrate Gamers The same goes for Game Center. Simply connect to game center at the bottom of this settings screen, which will instantly connect Clash to that iOS device. With Android users can simply transfer the entire village with Google+, but iOS requires Game Center and using a link code. The bottom left is where you’ll need to click to connect to Game Center This is the first step all users should take, to ensure they’ll never lose a village. If this isn’t done, Supercell might be able to recover a village if you know the email account, name, clan name and other information, but it could take days or weeks to be recovered. How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Whether it’s on Android or iOS, the process of transferring the game is rather easy. With iOS and Game Center you’ll need a device linking code. However, you’ll need both devices side by side to enter the code, or write it down. It’s crucial that you follow the first step mentioned above, and sign into Game Center or Google+ on your current device first before trying to transfer the game. Better safe than sorry. Read: How to Fix Clash of Clans Device Not Compatible Error  With Android, transferring your Clash of Clans village to a new device (phone or tablet) couldn’t be easier thanks to Google Play Games, and Google+. Download Clash of Clans on your new smartphone or tablet, go through the tutorial, then follow the steps from the video below. Simply connect and sign into Google+ inside the game and it transfers the data over. The process is slightly different with iOS, and users will need to use Game Center and the “link a device” code button shown at the end of the video, or in the screenshot below. Tap this to get started. With iPhone or iPad you’ll need the old device and the new one, which can be a problem if a device is lost or stolen. If so, contact Supercell for further assistance. On iOS hit settings > Link a device > and tap “this is the OLD DEVICE“. Clash will generate a code for you. Leave this on the screen, write it down, or take a screenshot. Do not lose it. Download Clash of Clans on your new iPhone or iPad, follow the same steps as above, but click “this is the NEW DEVICE” and enter the code. Sign into Game Center, and Clash will transfer to your new iOS device. It’s worth mentioning that if you download Clash on a new device and buy gems, or progress past Town Hall level 4, you can’t transfer your old game data. Meaning you’ll have to uninstall and reinstall the game, then try the transfer. So don’t play at all, and just follow the steps above to transfer an old village. If you try to transfer a village but your Gmail is tied to the wrong one, make a new Google account and re-connect it. Head to settings > accounts > add account > Google and make a new Google account. Then open Clash, and sync your current game to a new Google account. Then try again on your new device, and it should load the right village. Find a Lost Village If you have lost your Clash of Clans account or village by losing a phone, getting it stolen, broke, uninstalling the game or doing a factory data reset and did not have it backed up, only the support team can help you. Start the game, hit settings, and press “Help & Support” to get started. Users can also proceed by contacting Clash of Clans support here. Head to Help & Support, and tap the “Start a conversation” button on the top right. This will connect you with Supercell support, and they can try and track down and find your lost account. Having a unique name makes this easier. The following information will be needed to find a lost village: Name of the lost village Name of the clan the lost village is a part of (to help track it down) Town Hall level of your lost village Last date & time played Player level in village (if available) Provide all the details you possibly can, do not delete the pre-populated information on the lost village page, and Supercell may be able to find and restore your village. If you lost the village on iOS for any reason and didn’t have it backed up to Game center, the same steps as above will be required. Depending on the uniqueness of the name, clan name, and available information Supercell support should be able to find and restore your village. If the Clan name is “Clash of Clans” or something generic, where thousands of others used the same, it may be more difficult. Always have a unique player and clan name. Fix for “Link Error 102” Sometimes users may run into an odd “link error 102” while trying to play or transfer Clash of Clans using the device link code. In order for the link to work often-times both devices need to be connected to the same internet connection. Meaning connect both the old and new device to the same WiFi connection at home, or a public WiFi hotspot like at Starbucks. If one device is a smartphone, and you don’t have WiFi, tether the internet connection in and connect your tablet or the other device to the original, so they’re on the same network, and retry the link code. If this still fails, try another wireless network. Connect both devices to a friends wireless network, a public library, Starbucks, or AT&T WiFi spots around many cities. If this still fails, use the in-game support tab mentioned above and answer all of Supercell’s questions, and a support member may be able to resolve the issue. How to Change Your Name Changing your name in Clash of Clans was nearly impossible until an update to the game back in April of 2015. In April Clash of Clans received an update with tons of new features, as well as the option to change your in-game name once. This can only be done for Town Hall level 5 and above. Read: How to Change Your Name in Clash of Clans While on the regular home area looking at your base, tap the 3-gears shaped button near the bottom right of the screen. Then tap “Settings” and select the “Change Name” button. A box will pop-up instructing the user to change their name, but you will be warned this can only be done once. And one time only. Now that Clash of Clans has this as an option, you can only do it once. So choose wisely. Simply enter the new name you’d like to enjoy during gameplay, and select continue. You’ll be prompted to write it again confirming it’s what you want, then a third confirmation page will make you write CONFIRM in all caps. This is to ensure this is the name you want to use, and users will once again be reminded this is their one and only name change. If for whatever reason you’d like to change it again, you probably can’t, but emailing support with a valid reason the staff may grant users a second chance. This won’t be as easy, but it is possible. Gem Purchase Didn’t Come Through While most in-game purchases for things like gems goes extremely smooth, occasionally Android and iOS users will have problems. Sometimes the Android, Apple, or Supercell servers may respond slowly, return an error, or fail. If this is the case users are recommended to wait a few minutes, check their email to see if it went through. If the purchase was accepted, wait a few minutes and the purchase should show up. Try closing the game and restarting it. And the gems should arrive. Gem hacks typically don’t work, and those with a jailbroken iPhone can sometimes cause other issues. If a purchase isn’t received within 24 hours, contact the Google Play Store or iTunes for a refund. Supercell cannot verify a purchase if it doesn’t clear, so users need to request a refund through the app store. Click here for more details. On Android the process is easier, and if you received an email that you bought gems, the same in-game support tab should usually resolve the issue. Gems Disappeared Gems don’t just disappear in Clash of Clans. The only way for them to be gone, is if they’re used. Meaning buying a shield, a builders hut, boosting, spending gems on gold, elixir or dark elixir, or speeding up building or troop upgrades. If gems are used accidentally by friends, family members, or children, too bad. Supercell cannot or will not refund gems that are accidentally used. However, if a purchase or connection problem caused lost gems, try the step mentioned above, or contact support. Can’t Find A Clan in Search Searching for a Clan in Clash of Clans can be challenging, simply because there are millions of players. Open the game, and hit the blue “i” button by your name near the top left. Then select “search clans“. If you can’t find the clan in search it’s because the name wasn’t original, and too many others used the same name. Make sure you know the clan name, badge design and colors. Even the Clan War level can help you find the right one. How to Play on Android and iPhone Yes, you can play the same Clash of Clans village on both platforms. Playing Clash of Clans on your iPhone, but also want to play it at home on your Samsung Galaxy Tab or Nexus 7? Here’s how: To play the same village on two different devices that aren’t both Android or iPhone, uses the same steps as above. Use the link code instructions above and transfer your iPhone Clash of Clans village to a new device, which can be an Android device. Your village will still be accessible on both devices. Again, always sync to Game Center or Google+ to save progress. Other Clash of Clans Problems Overall there aren’t too many issues in Clash of Clans. It’s one of the most popular, stable, and best games on Android or iOS. While most of the issues users face have been detailed above, if you have any other issues head to the Clash of Clans support forum. If the game isn’t loading try rebooting your phone. If updates are failing try closing the game, closing apps like the App Store or Google Play, re-opening, and trying again. Typically these are all connection issues, not related to Clash itself. Slow load times, searching in matchmaking and other things are often based on connection, base layout, and other variables. If you have any other problems hit the link above and ask someone on the official forums, try the in-game support system, or drop us a comment below. 75 Responses 12/04/2015 Salinajhone Reply 15 my best friend’s step-sister makes $62 every hour on the laptop .

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. By Lucian Constantin Romania Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 24, 2017 10:32 AM PT Credit: Peter Sayer More like this Chrome bug triggered website errors with Symantec SSL certificates Facebook helps companies detect rogue SSL certificates for domains GoDaddy revokes nearly 9,000 SSL certificates issued without proper validation Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now Google is considering a harsh punishment for repeated incidents in which Symantec or its certificate resellers improperly issued SSL certificates. A proposed plan is to force the company to replace all of its customers’ certificates and to stop recognizing the extended validation (EV) status of those that have it. According to a Netcraft survey from 2015, Symantec is responsible for about one in every three SSL certificates used on the web, making it the largest commercial certificate issuer in the world. As a result of acquisitions over the years the company now controls the root certificates of several formerly standalone certificate authorities including VeriSign, GeoTrust, Thawte and RapidSSL. SSL/TLS certificates are used to encrypt the connections between browsers and HTTPS-enabled websites and also to verify that users are actually visiting the websites they intended to and not spoofed versions. These certificates are issued by organizations known as certificate authorities that are trusted by default in browsers and operating systems. The process of issuing and managing certificates is governed by rules created by the CA/Browser Forum, an organization whose members include browser vendors and certificate authorities. When those rules are violated, browser and OS vendors can revoke trust in the offending certificates and sanction the responsible certificate authorities, going as far as kicking them out of their root certificate stores. Google says that an investigation into a recent incident indicates that Symantec has not upheld security practices expected of certificate authorities, such as validating domain control,  auditing logs for evidence of unauthorized issuance, and minimizing the ability for the issuance of fraudulent certificates. If Google's plan is put into practice, millions of existing Symantec certificates will become untrusted over the next 12 months in Google Chrome. This will be a gradual process where every new Chrome release will distrust a new batch of certificates starting with Chrome 59,  which will revoke trust in certificates that have a validity period of over 33 months. This will put enormous pressure on Symantec, as the company will have to contact all customers, validate their identity and the ownership of their domains all over again, and replace their existing certificates with new ones, most likely at no cost. Some companies will likely have problems replacing their certificates on such short notice, as they might be used in payment terminals and other hard-to-reach embedded devices. In addition to that, Symantec might have to refund customers who paid for EV certificates that will no longer be recognized as such in Chrome, since their value would be significantly reduced. The ban on Symantec EV certificates will last for at least one year. All replacement certificates issued by Symantec to customers will need to have a validity period of nine months or less in order to be trusted in Chrome. This is likely to cause further problems for some large companies, which won't be able to easily replace their certificates every nine months. It's safe to say that Google's sanctions might have a significant impact on Symantec's SSL business, as the company is likely to lose customers who won't be willing to put up with these restrictions and will take their business to a different certificate authority (CA). Browser vendors have punished CAs before for improperly issuing certificates -- or "misissuing" them, in industry parlance -- but never on this scale and with an impact so large on the ecosystem. Some people have always wondered if browser vendors can really take drastic sanctions against the world's largest CAs, or whether those authorities are simply too big to fail. The reason for this unprecedented punishment seems to be repeated incidents of misissued certificates at Symantec that have come to light over the past few years, some of which the company failed to identify on its own despite internal and external audits. The latest case was uncovered this year and involved 127 certificates issued with bogus information or without proper domain ownership verification by a Symantec partner that operated as a registration authority (RA). According to Google, that investigation calls into question the validity of at least 30,000 certificates issued by Symantec partners over a period spanning several years. However, Symantec disputes that number. "Symantec allowed at least four parties access to their infrastructure in a way to cause certificate issuance, did not sufficiently oversee these capabilities as required and expected, and when presented with evidence of these organizations’ failure to abide to the appropriate standard of care, failed to disclose such information in a timely manner or to identify the significance of the issues reported to them," Google's Ryan Sleevi said in a post on the Chrome development mailing list. This and past incidents have led Google to "no longer have confidence in the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec over the past several years," Sleevi said. Symantec strongly objected to Google's plan and criticized its publication. It also described Google's remarks about the company's past misissuances as "exaggerated and misleading." "This action was unexpected, and we believe the blog post was irresponsible," the company said in a blog post Friday. "We hope it was not calculated to create uncertainty and doubt within the Internet community about our SSL/TLS certificates." The claim about the 30,000 certficates is not true and the 127 certificates that have been confirmed as misissued did not result in any consumer harm, Symantec said, adding that the relationship with the partner responsible for the incident has been terminated and that its entire RA program has been discontinued. "While all major CAs have experienced SSL/TLS certificate mis-issuance events, Google has singled out the Symantec Certificate Authority in its proposal even though the mis-issuance event identified in Google’s blog post involved several CAs," Symantec said. The company will work to minimize any potential disruption caused by Google's proposal if it goes forward, but is open to discussing the matter with Google and finding a mutually agreed-on solution. Meanwhile, Mozilla, which manages its own root certificate program, is also considering sanctions for Symantec and might have to align them with Google's. "Now that Google have announced their action, it is unavoidable to note that it can be preferable for two root stores considering action against a CA to take broadly parallel approaches, so that the CA is not doubly penalised for the same actions," Mozilla's Gervase Markham wrote on the organization's security policy mailing list. However, Markham noted that Google's plan is "at the strong end" of the options he was considering and that calibrating the level of response, which has to take into account previous precedents and sanctions against other CAs, is a difficult process.

Google was found to provide easy access to online terror manuals while Boris Johnson demanded social media platforms crack down on “corrupting and polluting” messages.    These companies are not ignorant of the danger. All three have all increased their response to violent and extremist material on their platforms in recent years – deleting posts, working with law enforcement and generating “counter-narratives”. But there is more they could be doing. First, they could introduce identity verification requirements to deter users from publicly sharing violent and hateful material. Facebook and Twitter don’t demand users’ real names, while Google lets them use services such as Youtube without any account at all. Mandating that consumers create profiles using their actual identity – including real name, address, and email – would be controversial, but would dampen the spread of extremism by making anonymity more difficult. Monthly active users - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp Second, companies could use the tools already at their disposal to not only promote counter-narratives but help them find a specific audience. The US, UK and EU have all recruited filmmakers and students to create anti-extremist material, but this is only valuable if it is seen by the right people at the right time. Online giants could use their sophisticated profiling capabilities to identify users at risk of radicalisation and ensure they see it. Third, artificial intelligence and image recognition software should be used to scan for and track illegal material, reducing the burden on humans who must manually flag and monitor it. This has already begun: Twitter last week began using IBM’s “Watson” AI system to hunt and censor abusive messages, while engineers at Dartmouth College in the US have created tools  to automatically detect child pornography. Twitter has teamed up with IBM to fight abuse on its platform Companies will have to tread a fine line in order to prevent monitoring becoming surveillance and promotion of counter-narratives becoming propaganda. They must guarantee that extra information they collect about their users – such as real identity or propensity to radicalisation – will never be used for other purposes such as advertising. They must pledge to be open and transparent about their methods, laying out clear policies about what constitutes extremist material, explaining how they monitor their sites, and clarifying their relationship with law enforcement. They will protest – with some justification – that it is not their job as “neutral” platforms to determine what is good and ungood. To protect free speech they must reserve these powers for the most dangerous cases, when online abuse could become real violence, As the guardians of the digital world, they are responsible for the communities and behaviour their services foster.

It's time for websites to turn on HTTPS encryption: the benefits are worth the... Beyond Google, rogue digital certificates also targeted Yahoo domains,... Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key Google is considering a harsh punishment for repeated incidents in which Symantec or its certificate resellers improperly issued SSL certificates. A proposed plan is to force the company to replace all of its customers’ certificates and to stop recognizing the extended validation (EV) status of those that have it. According to a Netcraft survey from 2015, Symantec is responsible for about one in every three SSL certificates used on the web, making it the largest commercial certificate issuer in the world. As a result of acquisitions over the years the company now controls the root certificates of several formerly standalone certificate authorities including VeriSign, GeoTrust, Thawte and RapidSSL. SSL/TLS certificates are used to encrypt the connections between browsers and HTTPS-enabled websites and also to verify that users are actually visiting the websites they intended to and not spoofed versions. These certificates are issued by organizations known as certificate authorities that are trusted by default in browsers and operating systems. [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] The process of issuing and managing certificates is governed by rules created by the CA/Browser Forum, an organization whose members include browser vendors and certificate authorities. When those rules are violated, browser and OS vendors can revoke trust in the offending certificates and sanction the responsible certificate authorities, going as far as kicking them out of their root certificate stores. Google says that an investigation into a recent incident indicates that Symantec has not upheld security practices expected of certificate authorities, such as validating domain control,  auditing logs for evidence of unauthorized issuance, and minimizing the ability for the issuance of fraudulent certificates. If Google’s plan is put into practice, millions of existing Symantec certificates will become untrusted over the next 12 months in Google Chrome. This will be a gradual process where every new Chrome release will distrust a new batch of certificates starting with Chrome 59,  which will revoke trust in certificates that have a validity period of over 33 months. This will put enormous pressure on Symantec, as the company will have to contact all customers, validate their identity and the ownership of their domains all over again, and replace their existing certificates with new ones, most likely at no cost. Some companies will likely have problems replacing their certificates on such short notice, as they might be used in payment terminals and other hard-to-reach embedded devices. In addition to that, Symantec might have to refund customers who paid for EV certificates that will no longer be recognized as such in Chrome, since their value would be significantly reduced. The ban on Symantec EV certificates will last for at least one year. All replacement certificates issued by Symantec to customers will need to have a validity period of nine months or less in order to be trusted in Chrome. This is likely to cause further problems for some large companies, which won’t be able to easily replace their certificates every nine months. It’s safe to say that Google’s sanctions might have a significant impact on Symantec’s SSL business, as the company is likely to lose customers who won’t be willing to put up with these restrictions and will take their business to a different certificate authority (CA). Browser vendors have punished CAs before for improperly issuing certificates—or “misissuing” them, in industry parlance—but never on this scale and with an impact so large on the ecosystem. Some people have always wondered if browser vendors can really take drastic sanctions against the world’s largest CAs, or whether those authorities are simply too big to fail. The reason for this unprecedented punishment seems to be repeated incidents of misissued certificates at Symantec that have come to light over the past few years, some of which the company failed to identify on its own despite internal and external audits. The latest case was uncovered this year and involved 127 certificates issued with bogus information or without proper domain ownership verification by a Symantec partner that operated as a registration authority (RA). According to Google, that investigation calls into question the validity of at least 30,000 certificates issued by Symantec partners over a period spanning several years. However, Symantec disputes that number. “Symantec allowed at least four parties access to their infrastructure in a way to cause certificate issuance, did not sufficiently oversee these capabilities as required and expected, and when presented with evidence of these organizations’ failure to abide to the appropriate standard of care, failed to disclose such information in a timely manner or to identify the significance of the issues reported to them,” Google’s Ryan Sleevi said in a post on the Chrome development mailing list. This and past incidents have led Google to “no longer have confidence in the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec over the past several years,” Sleevi said. Symantec strongly objected to Google’s plan and criticized its publication. It also described Google’s remarks about the company’s past misissuances as “exaggerated and misleading.” “This action was unexpected, and we believe the blog post was irresponsible,” the company said in a blog post Friday. “We hope it was not calculated to create uncertainty and doubt within the Internet community about our SSL/TLS certificates.” The claim about the 30,000 certficates is not true and the 127 certificates that have been confirmed as misissued did not result in any consumer harm, Symantec said, adding that the relationship with the partner responsible for the incident has been terminated and that its entire RA program has been discontinued. “While all major CAs have experienced SSL/TLS certificate mis-issuance events, Google has singled out the Symantec Certificate Authority in its proposal even though the mis-issuance event identified in Google’s blog post involved several CAs,” Symantec said. The company will work to minimize any potential disruption caused by Google’s proposal if it goes forward, but is open to discussing the matter with Google and finding a mutually agreed-on solution. Meanwhile, Mozilla, which manages its own root certificate program, is also considering sanctions for Symantec and might have to align them with Google’s. “Now that Google have announced their action, it is unavoidable to note that it can be preferable for two root stores considering action against a CA to take broadly parallel approaches, so that the CA is not doubly penalised for the same actions,” Mozilla’s Gervase Markham wrote on the organization’s security policy mailing list. However, Markham noted that Google’s plan is “at the strong end” of the options he was considering and that calibrating the level of response, which has to take into account previous precedents and sanctions against other CAs, is a difficult process.

A new report claims that Google Hangouts will alert users that they will no longer be able to use the app for texting on March 27. It claims that users will be asked to select a new default messaging app after this. If they don’t have one, they will be taken to the Google Play Store to chose a new messaging app. The change won’t actually stop everyone from using Google Hangouts as a messaging service. Google Voice users will reportedly still be able to use the app for text messaging even after May 22. However, they will get a notification telling them that their carrier number can no longer be used with Hangouts, reports Engadget. Google Hangouts users that are worried about losing their old messages are fretting over nothing. When choosing a new default messaging app, their old text messages will be transferred over from Hangouts to that one. Google has plenty of messaging apps to chose from on the Play Store. The reported decision to remove text messaging from Hangouts likely has to do with Alphabet Inc’s plans for the app. The company has expressed its interest in making the app more focused on productivity. It hopes to set it up as a better tool for business users, Ars Technica notes. A Reddit post claims to have the full email concerning the changes coming to Google Hangouts.

They urge fanatics to deploy large vehicles as 'tools of war' before going on a stabbing rampage – the template for Wednesday's atrocity. Vile manuals were online despite widespread warnings that UK jihadists use them for training £18bn wiped off Google in eight days  More than £18billion has been wiped off Google's value in eight days, amid the furious backlash over its profits from hate. The slump in value came as Britain's biggest advertisers demanded that the technology giant fixes its scandal-hit Youtube platform, or watch as more companies pull their ads.  The damage to Google's reputation has shaken shareholder faith in the technology giant – dragging its valuation down from £471billlion when the scandal reached fever pitch last Friday, to less than £453billion.  Google bosses have offered a number of mealy-mouthed apologies, in an effort to limit the damage. But MPs and advertisers say that it has not gone far enough. They have demanded to know whether Google will refund advertisers whose brands appeared alongside hate videos. And they want assurances from the technology giant that it will start paying staff to actively seek out content, instead of relying on technology and users to flag up problems.  Before the attack took place, Google had already been forced to promise it would take a 'tougher stance' on hateful content after an outcry and boycotts from advertisers over their content appearing alongside extreme material.  More than 260 brands have already joined a boycott of Youtube, since a Times investigation found adverts for blue-chip brands and Government departments alongside hate videos by ISIS preachers and White Supremacists. Not only did Google get paid for these ads. It channelled funds directly into the hands of the extremists.  The Prime Minister's official spokesman said social media companies and search engines must stop the material being posted and act quickly to take it down if it does appear online. He said: 'The fight against terrorism and hate speech has to be a joint one. The Government and security services are doing everything they can. 'It's clear that social media companies can and must do more. 'Social media companies have a responsibility when it comes to making sure this material is not disseminated. 'We have been clear repeatedly that we think they can and must do more and we are always talking with them on how to achieve that. 'The ball is now in their court. Let's see how they respond. 'Clearly, we don't want this material to appear in the first place. Beyond that we want it to be taken down as quickly as possible. 'It's in everyone's interest for this material not to be disseminated at all.' The comments from May's office echo those of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who on Thursday said internet providers and social media companies have 'got to look at the stuff that's going up on their sites, they've got to take steps to invigilate it, to take it down where they can.'   Conspiracy theorists: The vile videos on YouTube have adverts alongside them   Share or comment on this article e-mail 39 shares Most watched News videos Dead man is cut out of the stomach of a seven metre long PYTHON Monkman gets the better of Seagull in University Challenge semi-final Shocking moment a driver is punched through his car window Driver's hilarious attempt to squeeze car through tight gap Maid caught on camera appearing to be POSSESSED by evil spirits Furious cyclist smashes driver's windscreen with his own bike Mother films invasive TSA pat-down of her disabled teenage son Brazen man catches huge COBRA out of hole with his bare hands Dad confronts policewoman who confiscated daffodils from daughters UNC's Luke Maye goes to his 8AM class after beating Kentucky Dramatic moment a car is struck by lightning as it drives down road Shocking carer steals money out of dementia patient's handbag Horrifying moment villagers cut open a giant python and...

The latest disgusting examples show how Google earns sick profits off content that teaches Jihadi terrorists how to commit mass murder using vehicles as weapons. Similarly, Facebook now gives “thumbs up” approval to posts that call for people to “kill white women” while simultaneously banning accounts that post Bible passages. How sick and evil have these tech giants really become? By some accounts, they now pose an imminent threat to not just the sanity — but even the safety — of citizens everywhere. Google makes money off “Jihadi terror manuals” Via the UK Daily Mail: In the hours after the London attack, the Daily Mail found vile Islamic State terror manuals online through simple searches on Google and Twitter. One included a section on using vehicles as weapons. The vile manuals were online despite widespread warnings that UK jihadists use them for training. Fanatics are urged to deploy large vehicles as ‘tools of war’ before going on a stabbing rampage – the template for Wednesday’s atrocity in Westminster. It told jihadists in the West to learn from Palestinian terrorists who ‘have resorted to using cars as tools of war, also knives as weapons which are easily available from DIY stores’. The manual was published a year ago, before the vehicle attacks in Nice, Berlin and London, which have killed 102 people and injured more than 500. Another Islamic State publication was available through Google and Twitter with detailed instructions on how to cause mayhem. In other words, anyone looking to learn how to commit murder and terrorism can go straight to Google to find out how it’s done. And during all searches, Google is making money off the search history data collection of the user as well as any possible ads that might appear, served up by Google Adwords. Facebook gives thumbs up to “white women should be hunted and killed” At the same time Google is profiting off Jjihadi terrorism manuals that promote the mass slaughter of innocents, Facebook is giving a “thumbs up” rating to a post that urges the mass killing of white women. As reported by InfoWars: The way in which Facebook polices content on its network is under scrutiny again after it was revealed that a post in which a user called for white women to be “hunted and killed” was deemed to not be a violation of community standards. “White women should be hunted and killed then we won’t get white babies who think the(y) own the world,” the user posted. When the post was reported by another user for “hate speech,” Facebook responded with the message, “We reviewed the comment you reported for displaying hate speech and found it doesn’t violate our Community Standards.” Meanwhile, posts by Christians that simply state bible passages in discussions about homosexuality are being removed, while pages devoted to showing grisly mock images of President Trump being assassinated are not taken down. Google and Facebook both promote extreme medical violence against children while doing business with criminal pharma companies As you absorb all this, keep in mind that both Google and Facebook also promote extreme medical violence against children by giving priority rankings to medical authorities and websites that push the injection of brain-damaging mercury into the bodies of innocent children. The medical maiming of children via toxic vaccines results in brain damage, autism, seizures, hospitalizations and more. The UK government recently paid out a massive financial settlement to over 60 families whose children were severely brain damaged by the same vaccines propagandizes by Google and Facebook. Similarly, both Google and Facebook give strong preference to pro-pharma content that promotes the financial interests of GlaxoSmithKline, a criminal organization that pleaded guilty to felony crimes for running a nationwide bribery ring. The U.S. Dept. of Justice reached a $3 billion criminal settlement with GSK, in which the company admitted to committing felony crimes. Yet Google and Facebook still happily conduct business with this criminal pharma cartel as well as dozens of other pharmaceutical companies engaged in similar criminal behavior. It is no exaggeration at all to state that Google and Facebook do business with drug cartels. …Even ones that have been found guilty of felony crimes in the United States, by the way. Google and Facebook profit from violence, murder, terrorism and criminal rackets What’s clear from all this is that Google and Facebook are both happy to make money off medical violence, murder, terrorism and violence as long as the revenues keep flowing in. For these internet giants, profits are far more important than anything else, even if it means hundreds of thousands of lives are harmed or even killed due to the information promoted on the Google or Facebook websites. While Google is making money off Jihadi terrorism and the criminal drug cartels, it recently blacklisted the entire Natural News website for 6 days to silence Natural News, invoking a completely fabricated technical excuse that none of over 1,000 SEO analysts could replicate or find on the Natural News website. Facebook is also engaged in the “shadow banning” of conservative or libertarian-leaning websites, quietly censoring their posts or even banning their websites entirely, leaving only the hate-filled rants of socially-obedient Leftists who demand things like the “killing of white women” (which seems perfectly reasonable to Facebook, apparently). It goes beyond saying that Google, Facebook, Twitter and other internet gatekeepers desperately need to be investigated by the Trump administration for collusion with criminal groups, censorship of legitimate free speech, and the deliberate blacklisting of targeted sites for political purposes.

Follow his videos, podcasts, websites and science projects at the links below. Mike Adams serves as the founding editor of NaturalNews.com and the lab science director of an internationally accredited (ISO 17025) analytical laboratory known as CWC Labs. There, he was awarded a Certificate of Excellence for achieving extremely high accuracy in the analysis of toxic elements in unknown water samples using ICP-MS instrumentation. Adams is also highly proficient in running liquid chromatography, ion chromatography and mass spectrometry time-of-flight analytical instrumentation. He has also achieved numerous laboratory breakthroughs in the programming of automated liquid handling robots for sample preparation and external standards prep. The U.S. patent office has awarded Mike Adams patent NO. US 9526751 B2 for the invention of “Cesium Eliminator,” a lifesaving invention that removes up to 95% of radioactive cesium from the human digestive tract. Adams has pledged to donate full patent licensing rights to any state or national government that needs to manufacture the product to save human lives in the aftermath of a nuclear accident, disaster, act of war or act of terrorism. He has also stockpiled 10,000 kg of raw material to manufacture Cesium Eliminator in a Texas warehouse, and plans to donate the finished product to help save lives in Texas when the next nuclear event occurs. No independent scientist in the world has done more research on the removal of radioactive elements from the human digestive tract. Adams is a person of color whose ancestors include Africans and American Indians. He is of Native American heritage, which he credits as inspiring his “Health Ranger” passion for protecting life and nature against the destruction caused by chemicals, heavy metals and other forms of pollution. Adams is the founder and publisher of the open source science journal Natural Science Journal, the author of numerous peer-reviewed science papers published by the journal, and the author of the world’s first book that published ICP-MS heavy metals analysis results for foods, dietary supplements, pet food, spices and fast food. The book is entitled Food Forensics and is published by BenBella Books. In his laboratory research, Adams has made numerous food safety breakthroughs such as revealing rice protein products imported from Asia to be contaminated with toxic heavy metals like lead, cadmium and tungsten. Adams was the first food science researcher to document high levels of tungsten in superfoods. He also discovered over 11 ppm lead in imported mangosteen powder, and led an industry-wide voluntary agreement to limit heavy metals in rice protein products. In addition to his lab work, Adams is also the (non-paid) executive director of the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center (CWC), an organization that redirects 100% of its donations receipts to grant programs that teach children and women how to grow their own food or vastly improve their nutrition. Through the non-profit CWC, Adams also launched Nutrition Rescue, a program that donates essential vitamins to people in need. Click here to see some of the CWC success stories. With a background in science and software technology, Adams is the original founder of the email newsletter technology company known as Arial Software. Using his technical experience combined with his love for natural health, Adams developed and deployed the content management system currently driving NaturalNews.com. He also engineered the high-level statistical algorithms that power SCIENCE.naturalnews.com, a massive research resource featuring over 10 million scientific studies. Adams is well known for his incredibly popular consumer activism video blowing the lid on fake blueberries used throughout the food supply. He has also exposed “strange fibers” found in Chicken McNuggets, fake academic credentials of so-called health “gurus,” dangerous “detox” products imported as battery acid and sold for oral consumption, fake acai berry scams, the California raw milk raids, the vaccine research fraud revealed by industry whistleblowers and many other topics. Adams has also helped defend the rights of home gardeners and protect the medical freedom rights of parents. Adams is widely recognized to have made a remarkable global impact on issues like GMOs, vaccines, nutrition therapies, human consciousness. In addition to his activism, Adams is an accomplished musician who has released over fifteen popular songs covering a variety of activism topics.

Home > Google News > Google Updates > Google Has Now Confirmed The Fred Algorithm Update Google Has Now Confirmed The Fred Algorithm Update Mar 24, 2017 • 8:08 am | (181) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google PageRank & Algorithm Updates Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Update: Gary Illyes from Google now officially confirmed the update on Twitter, more details at the end of this story. Yesterday, during the AMA with Google session at SMX West, Google's Gary Illyes may have confirmed the Fred algorithm update that targeted low value content on March 7th/8th. Gary said in his response to questions about this Fred update that when they discussed the industry chatter on this update, his "search leads" (I guess his bosses) decided not to discuss it with the public. Then Gary said he will say one thing, that the sites impacted by this update should have been because what they are doing are specifically against Google's webmaster guidelines. Gary said the answer to why sites got hit by this is in the existing webmaster guidelines. I did try to get Gary to give us one specific guideline that these sites violated but he wouldn't add anything more about this update. Again, if I had to guess based on reviewing over 100 sites that saw significant drops on March 8th, I'd said most had low value content with the goal of revenue generation only.

 The YouTube ad boycott will have a minimal impact on Google's business Julien Rath Mar. 24, 2017, 1:06 PM 3,898 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai.Getty Images The advertiser boycott Google and YouTube are facing is unlikely to impact near-term revenues, according to two Wall Street analysts. Google dominates search advertising with a share of over 75% of the market in the US and generated more than $24 billion in revenue in 2016. A note from Morgan Stanley explained the part of the business affected by the boycott – YouTube ads and Google's Display Network – make up just 10% of net revenues. That part of Google's business is split across millions of clients, so the boycott is unlikely to harm the company's bottom line, the analysts said. Another note from RBC Capital Markets estimates that, in the unlikely event there is a 10% decrease in YouTube and Google Display Network revenues, it would reduce Google's overall revenues by 1.7%. Similarly a 2% decrease would affect only 0.3% of the company's overall revenues. RBC's note said a continued drop in advertiser interest in YouTube would benefit Facebook and Instagram. Morgan Stanley's note added that a result could be brands moving back to traditional TV advertising or slowing down their shift away from it. Industry executives at Advertising Week Europe said the backlash against Google could be a result of opportunism coming from the established players, such as TV and media buying agencies, in the advertising industry wanting to retain their position. According to eMarketer Google accounts for over 40% of US digital ad revenues. The Mountain View company this week announced tougher ad policies, increased control for marketers, and said it would grow its capacity to review offensive content with a hiring spree to combat the issue. More than 250 brands in the UK and US froze their ads on Google following The Times' investigation into ads appearing alongside offensive content. Get the latest Google stock price here.

Google actually released Hangouts back in 2013 as a more feature-filled chat service to take the place of Talk in the Gmail sidebar, but users have been able to stick with the older, more basic service if they chose. That’s changing on June 26th, when anyone still using Gchat will be forcibly transitioned over to Hangouts. It’s not a major change for most — there will still be chat built into Gmail, contacts will transition over, and Google has been trying to get people to switch over to Hangouts for the last four years, so maybe it’s time for Talk to go. The Google Talk Android app will also stop functioning, as will any third-party apps designed for Talk. (Again, anything using Hangouts — which is essentially the same thing — will still be fine.) Still, it’s sad to see the messaging service go, even if it’s mostly just in name — Gchat was a huge way of communicating on the internet back in in the early 2000s, and harkens back to a simpler time when AIM ruled supreme. Fortunately, Google has at least seven other messaging services that you can use, including Allo, Duo, Hangouts, Android Messages, Voice, and Supersonic Fun Voice Messenger, so you’ve got plenty of other options to use going forward. (One could also wonder why Google is switching people over to Hangouts when Allo exists, but that’s a thought exercise left for another time.) Google also confirmed that it will be removing SMS support from Hangouts (as previously rumored), and encouraging Android users to switch over to the newly renamed Android Messages app. It’s a move that speaks both to Google’s increasing push for RCS messaging, as well as the company’s ambitions to reposition Hangouts into a viable business messaging tool to take on competitors like Slack.

By: PTI | Mumbai | Updated: March 24, 2017 11:04 PM The court had earlier issued notices to YouTube and search engine Google, seeking their response as to why action for contempt of court should not be initiated against them. (Reuters) A full bench of the Bombay High Court today directed Google India and YouTube to immediately remove video clips posted on websites recently which allegedly show judiciary in bad light and bring disrepute to the Judges. Complaints which defame judiciary should be brought to the notice of the High Court Registry which in turn would inform Google and YouTube about these objectionable video clips, said the full bench headed by Chief Justice Manjula Chellur. The court was hearing a contempt petition filed by Bombay Bar Association (BBA) challenging a video clip on YouTube which purportedly showed proceedings in a courtroom of a high court and levelled allegations of corruption against the judge. BBA counsel Srihari Aney informed the court that despite its earlier order such video clips were still being uploaded on websites and that it should be immediately stopped. The bench then directed YouTube and Google to ensure that such video clips are removed immediately if brought to their notice by the high court registry. You May Also Want To Watch: The court had earlier issued notices to YouTube and search engine Google, seeking their response as to why action for contempt of court should not be initiated against them. The petition sought contempt action against the persons who recorded and uploaded the video on YouTube levelling allegations of corruption against Justice S J Kathawala of the high court. “The 38-minute video uploaded last week by ‘Right Mirror’ copies the format of a news channel and shows a person acting as anchor and taking interviews of several persons including lawyer Nilesh Ojha making scandalous remarks against judges of this high court,” said the petition. A division bench of the high court had last month also ordered YouTube and other respondents to remove this video clip immediately. “Considering the scandalous and contemptuous nature of the video, we are inclined to order the respondents to forthwith remove the offending video,” the court had said.

Next StoryGoogle Activates Server-Side Change to Somehow Address Pixel’s Bluetooth Issues by Kellex on Mar 24, 2017 @droid_life Apps News Home Share this Story Google Releases More Details on the Death of SMS in Hangouts After a surprise announcement made its way onto reddit last night, Google has spent a good chunk of the morning doing plenty of clarifying over what’s actually happening with Hangouts and SMS integration. To be clear, though, last night’s information is 100% correct and SMS within Hangouts is going away for most people, but Google has post in a variety of its product forums today to help answer any questions Google Voice, Project Fi, and general Hangouts users might have. Below, we’ve done our best to compile the important stuff.  1. Hangouts will lose SMS integration on May 22, 2017 (for the most part, depending on a handful of factors). Folks who use Hangouts for SMS with a carrier phone number (not a Google Voice or Project Fi number) will have to choose a new SMS app by that day. If you haven’t chosen an app by that day, Google will switch your default SMS app to another that is already on your phone. Yes, you are being forced to use another app for SMS by May 22. 2. Will Google remind me about the change? Yes, you’ll see a notification within Hangouts letting you know that SMS is going away and you’ll need to find a new app. It looks like the image at the top of this post. 3. Streamlining: Google says that SMS leaving Hangouts is a streamlining effort that further enforces their commitment to Hangouts as an enterprise app. Whether you agree with the direction doesn’t matter at this point, because that’s what we’ve got coming. Google wants users to use Android Messages for SMS (or any other SMS app that isn’t Hangouts). 4. Google Voice users: You aren’t affected by this change at this time if you send SMS with your Google Voice number. You can still get SMS messages within Hangouts if you want and carry-on as if nothing has changed. With that said, if you are a Google Voice user who happens to send SMS with a carrier number instead of your Google Voice number, you will have to find another SMS solution, like Android Messages. 5. Project Fi users: You aren’t affected by this change either. As I mentioned, Google has posted info about the upcoming change to a variety of its product forums. If the five bullets above don’t answer the questions you have, be sure to find the correct link below and you should be able to find them.

Hiral Patel Google please don’t take away by Google Voice – I save $120 every year by not having a texting plan. trixnkix637 Am I the only one who actually likes using Android Messages and never liked Hangouts at all? An Android equivalent iMessage app would be cool, but isn’t make or break for anyone. Just another cool feature to have one day. Until then we all have Pushbullet. OlayTerry Whoever is in charge of developing messaging / IM app at Google must be a hopeless weapons grade retard. Apple already demonstrated that people want one messaging app that does it all and does it well. You don’t need a genius to figure this out. Google instead decides to create a billion apps that do nothing well and keeps sabotaging its own apps. Kevin Davis I gave in back in December. iMessage kicks ass. Family, friends, co-workers, kid’s teachers. Hell, basically everybody you need to communicate with in a seamless, positive manner, without having to give it a second thought. I really like my Pixel XL, but, it is what it is. Oh, well. Turb0wned Come Samsung, it’s up to you, make the iMessage of Android. Google has no idea what it’s doing anymore. OlayTerry I hope Samsung can pull that off. That would be simply awesome Gary Graf They did have Chat On but they shut that down Under the bridge downtown If Android Messages had an automatic cloud backup feature, I would be all over it. Until them, Verizon Message+ it is! Hangouts is good at being a Whatsapp alternative. ScoobySnack Loading SMS messages in Hangouts has been laggy for at least 6 months. Sick and tired of this poor product offerings on Android. I’m on the new lookout for a new messaging app… honestly, as much as I always thought I’d never say it, it might be iMessage. :/ Don Ray Well that sucks…can’t say I am surprised that Hangouts is losing functionality, but as one who uses it for SMS among other things, it sucks. jonzey231 Holding my breath for some great revelation at I/O. George Davis That does it — I’m switching to Signal. It’s far more secure anyway. Trooper311 Hey Google. I have someone for you to meet. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9d886ce93111d2961a08cb1d13b874d83e4e94c6dd94800325f54b6d3bdf4b6f.gif Trooper311 Hey Google. mcdonsco Can someone please explain to me why (if there is a reason) Google has STILL not released a COMPLETE messaging app like iOS/Apples messaging where you can natively text from any [Apple] device and because it’s synced, it’s automatically backed up too. I can’t figure out for the life of me why Google seems to refuse to do this? Baffles me. Gary Graf Google did have a complete messaging app at one time. It was called Hangouts. Right after they combined everything, they started stripping it away. Craig Well…I see Google’s messaging strategy remains as opaque as ever… catpunt As someone who uses Google Voice exclusively, in greatly relieved Chris but for how long? (I’m in the same boat) catpunt Well I paid $20 to port my number to Google Voice so I hope that counts for something in Google’s eyes SuperMarkert Have you tried the new GV app? It’s way better than it used to be, and it’s clearly going to be your only option at some point. I don’t see them allowing GV users in Hangouts much longer. catpunt Yeah the new app is a step in the right direction at long last. But I prefer to use a single app for all messaging. Sadly, I don’t think this is Google vision for the future. h4rr4r Does it do voip yet? Last I checked it did not. What a total failure. SuperMarkert No, but Google did confirm that it is coming. Meanwhile, you can still use the Hangouts dialer for that. It still works for GV users. h4rr4r Until that is removed in a week. Jérôme Besnard My theory is that by the time Hangout is put to death (and fully reincarnated into enterprise solution only), Allo will integrate GV, Fi, SMS, and web app. Being a Fi customer that loves Hangout in my Inbox web page, I certainly hope so. igchy i’m not. i’m exclusive GV user as well. but the only one way to make GV number default for all outgoing SMS messages (for example Assistant, or answer while receiving a call, etc.) is to use Hangouts. if that’s gone there is no way to make GV your default number for the outgoing text messages. Jérôme Besnard I’m on Fi. Life is good! Geoff__W Same here. Agreed! Jérôme Besnard I text from Inbox when at work. Pushbullet would have been a band aid to me. I like to be able to email and SMS from the same page (and hangout message with my family overseas). Jesse Blacklock I am very relieved. Makes no sense to use hangouts and another app. Should have seen the writing on the wall few months back when they removed merged conversations. Jérôme Besnard That’s right. I forgot about that. I loved that feature. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ SMS needs to die just saying JSo RCS will take over eventually jak_341 Not unless Apple uses it as a fallback. If they don’t, SMS will live on. Steve Hendricks If someone’s primary concern in a smart phone was having a consistent, robust messaging platform, I could not, and would not, in good conscience recommend Android. iMessage is one of Apple’s crown jewels, and it is really the last temptation that makes me consider going back to the walled garden. Why has this been such a stupidly difficult nut for google to crack? Robert Phelan I saw the writing on the wall with Google months ago. I switched to iOS and am not looking back. Texts are number one for me and iMessages just work. One app does it all and does it good. Steve Hendricks A couple of things keep me with android. Since Samsung brought back SD Card support, and I can still customize my phone better, I’m still team Android. BUT, it seems with every iteration of iOS, they get just a bit closer. p0k3y Same boat here, but since my number is with Google Voice, I still have to use Hangout/GV for SMS. Or is there a way to integrate GV number into iMessage? bhayes444 TL;dr: It works, but is wonky. Not that I’ve found. Other than forwarding to a carrier phone number, but then the phone number that shows in the threads overview for iMessage has a different phone number than what the person uses to text you; although in the actual thread their correct number is displayed. It’s just a weird set up, and I call that incorrect number my contact’s “Google Voice number” as texting/calling that number works correctly. As an example: if my friend had the number 555-234-4544, when they text my google voice number Google voice would forward that text to my carrier number, and it would be displayed as something different: 552-342-7787. Texting that number still replies to my friend, but it is just weird. osgoodschlotter I just left GV and ported my number to AT&T last week on an iPhone. Go into an AT&T store… it’ll take 10 minutes. You need your Gvoice number and voicemail PIN. Oh, and when they ask you for your GVoice ‘account number’ don’t take any crap from them… it’s your GVoice number with a 1 in front of it. And don’t forget that voicemail PIN, it’s necessary for the port to happen! (you can create one in your GVoice web settings if you need to) Thanassi Karageorgiou But… You kinda are looking back. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Robert Phelan Lol. Ok let my be more literal…. I am not GOING back. After many years with Android I find iMessage the superior texting app. I gave up customization for the better texting experience. iOS and Android are both very good in their own ways and the two systems push each other to be better. Win/win for us. Art Ramirez Why is it so difficult for Google to create an app that works just like iMessage? I’m genuinely asking, not being an ass. Can some of you devs ELI5? I mean they have some apps that do this, some apps that do that, why not make a single app instead? Seems to me that it would be easier for them also to only have to update one app as opposed to 32 or so. hiphype Unfortunately, it’s been a long time coming. I’m just glad some sort of initiative is being taken to do something. Just wish they could give us a concrete understanding of what our ecosystem will look like in the end, instead of jerking everyone around. Doomstang What if I have the Sprint integration with Google Voice where my Sprint number IS my google voice number? cjohn4043 I’ll say it, I switched to iPhone. I’ve been an Android fan since 2010 and I’ve owned several phones/tablets/watch all running Android. I love Google’s services, but the inconsistency they have showed time and time again is aggravating. Usually, Apple takes their time to release products and goes all in once those product are released and polished. I wish Google had a true messaging competitor or Apple to release iMessage on Android, but those two things seem so far off. I’ve been happy with my iPhone, but jeez I wish Google would get it’s act together. RyanT Do they really think people want 10 million different apps? I don’t know why they can’t see iMessage (or Messages now) works because it is streamlined and works without user input. I’m not a big Apple fan, but they got the concept right with iMessage. Even more confusing that they’re being so hard headed about adding SMS (or even RCS) to Allo. Greg Van Gorp It seems like people don’t actually want more than one app, but that’s what the usage metrics show. Think about how many people used facebook messenger on facebook. Quite a bit, but as soon as it was it’s own separate app that supported SMS and other features, their usage rates soared. People don’t actually seem to want another app, but how they actually use the services is a different story. I used Hangouts forever and I’m sooo pissed about this. I have no alternative to message on phone, continue on the computer, then back to phone and have it support SMS as well right now without using facebook messenger. NastyEmu Because enterprises have no use for SMS? mickeyB88 I can see how a focus on enterprise would make Google think that (carrier-based) SMS has no place in hangouts, since they assume if you use hangouts for SMS it would essentially merge your business conversations with personal ones. De-lineating that would be a first step in classifying hangouts as meant for “enterprise,” or their Slack competitor. Since Google Voice SMS integration remains, I guess they assume you’d also use that number for enterprise means? I have no idea, since Google isn’t giving any reasons, really. Just saying “enterprise” and hoping those who use hangouts won’t scream too loud. I don’t agree with it at all, but I can kind of see the logic. h4rr4r Yeah, we never use them for notification services or anything. Indianajonze i’ll start. i’m beginning to hate google wade_county google in a nutshell https://twitter.com/RonAmadeo/status/843852120562552832 El_Big_CHRIS lmfao this is hilarious jidrukebok <- I was without work for 6 months when my former Co-worker lastly recommended me to start freelancing at home… It was only after I gained $5000 in my initial month when I really believed I am able to do this for a living! At the moment I am joyful than ever… I work-from-home moreover I am my own boss now like I always wanted… I see quite a lot of unsatisfied people around me, working the same old boring job that is sucking the daily life out of all of them day-after-day… Each time I see anybody similar to that I say START FREELANCING MAN!

MUMBAI: A full bench of the Bombay high court on Friday directed Youtube and Google Inc to delete pages that featured supposed "sting videos" of court proceedings. It was a historic hearing in the central court room packed with lawyers, litigants and media persons. A bench comprising chief justice Manjula Chellur, Justice Shantanu Kemkar, Justice Abhay Oka, Justice Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Justice R M Savant commenced hearing on a contempt petition filed by the Bombay Bar Association against 14 persons and entities, including a lawyer, for defaming the judiciary. The contempt petitions have also been filed against Youtube, Google Inc, Alphabet and Google India. The court asked Youtube and Google Inc to also delete any "objectionable" videos that are uploaded in the future on the subject concerning the contempt case on receiving the URL from the HC registrar general. The petition filed by BBA had urged the court to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against an advocate and others involved in video recording of court proceedings and uploading it online as a sting. A division bench headed by Justice Oka had last month referred the case to a larger bench. "The issues which may arise in this contempt petition are of great deal of importance for the institution of judiciary. The issues directly concern the independence of the judiciary. Considering the fact that the issues involved are of paramount importance to the judicial system, it will be appropriate if this petition is placed before a larger bench of three or more Judges," the court had said. Senior advocate Shrihari Aney, counsel for the BBA, pointed out that while Youtube had taken down the objectionable videos, the title and caption remained on the pages. Senior advocate V Tulzapurkar, representing Youtube, cited a technical issue and added that he would check if it was possible to delete the pages. Advocate Nilesh Ojha, the lawyer against whom contempt notices were issued, questioned the maintainability of BBA's petition and said the association had no locus standi to file the case. The bench said that it would hear the issue of maintainability. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

The changes are part of a larger effort to “streamline” Hangouts and Gmail as G Suite offerings… Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services The first part of this is of course Google’s focus on its new Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat apps, and how that’s going to impact the traditional Hangouts app for enterprise and consumer users alike.  As we mentioned yesterday, Google wants the Messages app to be the new home for SMS on Android. We’ve been working hard to streamline the classic Hangouts product for enterprise users, and, as part of this effort, will be removing carrier SMS functionality in the classic Hangouts app for Android, starting on May 22. Google Talk will also be fully transitioning to Hangouts starting the summer. The company says that after June 26, users of Talk in Gmail will be automatically transitioned to Hangouts. Also, Google says XMPP federation with third-party providers will no longer be supported as of June 26th and the Google Talk app for Android will soon cease functioning. Google also says it will soon be retiring several Gmails Labs features: So in the coming weeks, we will retire the following Labs: Authentication Icon, Google Voice Player, Picasa previews, Pictures in chat, Quick Links, Quote Selected Text, Smartlabels, and Yelp previews. (Expected: No earlier than April 24, 2017) Finally, Google is retiring a couple of legacy Google+ features that have long lived in Gmail (although it’s likely most people haven’t used them in a very long time): As part of our continued effort to focus Google+ around shared interests, we’re retiring two legacy Google+ features in Gmail: the ability to email Google+ profiles and the use of Google+ Circles. (Expected: No earlier than April 24, 2017) As always, you can see overview of these changes and more that might affect you or your organization over at the G Suite website.

The company is believed to be making the move as part of its efforts to make Hangouts a better rival to upstart messaging app Slack. Google announced a complete overhaul of its Hangouts brand earlier this month, launching new "Hangouts Meet" and "Hangouts Chat" apps aimed at enterprise customers. For now, the current version of Hangouts remains available for consumers but Google is promoting the use of its Allo and Duo apps. Part of Hangouts' popularity is down to its ability to send and receive SMS messages. This has traditionally made it the ideal default messaging app for people who regularly text and use Google services. According to an email being sent by Google to G Suite Administrators, since uploaded to Reddit, this feature will soon be removed. Google plans to discontinue Hangouts' carrier-billed SMS text messaging support on May 22nd, 2017. Users will be informed of the change and prompted to select a different messaging app as their default SMS provider. If no appropriate app is installed, a new one will need to be downloaded from Google Play. People who currently use Google Voice for sending and receiving SMS messages will not be affected. Google will continue to support Voice's SMS capabilities and is only targeting users who rely on Hangouts to send messages over their cellular connection. It's all part of the company's plan to pitch Hangouts as a workplace communications tool to rival Slack and Microsoft Teams. Google currently has an extensive line-up of messaging apps that each overlap in some way. The company has separated calling and texting into different apps and then created new products for enterprise and business customers. The old ones are still active though, leaving you to choose between Android Messages, Allo, Duo, Hangouts, Hangouts Meet, Hangouts Chat or Google Voice depending on your use case. In short, it's confusing so Google is adding or removing capabilities to make each app's purpose clearer. Hangouts is no longer pitched as a general-purpose app for consumers and has been removed from the standard Android image installed on new phones. The company is still struggling to convince the app's users to make the switch to Allo and Duo, its new consumer-friendly replacement products. Hangouts has a large and loyal audience of fans who rely on its advanced features and strong integration with platform capabilities like SMS. In contrast, Allo and Duo are bare-bones apps that aren't being picked up in the way Google had anticipated. If you currently use Hangouts as your default SMS app, Google now expects you to install Android Messages instead. In another questionable decision, Google has opted not to bake SMS support into Allo, generally its preferred consumer messaging app. Instead, it made yet another app to promote its RCS messaging protocol, a standard meant to supersede SMS. Android Messages will now be preinstalled on many phones that once shipped with Hangouts.

By: PTI | New Delhi | Published:March 24, 2017 10:38 pm Google and NIELIT will also run digital marketing training programme The government-run IT institute NIELIT, in collaboration with Internet giant Google, will roll out courses to train 1 lakh students for Android application development for less than Rs 5,000 per head. “We will provide free of cost all course material for Android app development to NIELIT, which will then train hundred thousand students,” Google South East Asia and India Vice-President Rajan Anandan said here while launching a series of IT initiatives with the Ministry of Electronics and IT. Google India will equip the National Institute trainers with training modules and content. They in turn will do the outreach by leveraging the 10,000 NIELIT (National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology) centres across the country. Additionally, Google India will provide mobile training labs to reach artisan clusters across India. “The Ministry of Electronics and IT intends to give impetus to the Prime Minister’s recent call for a ‘New India’. Collaboration with Google will be hugely beneficial in harnessing capabilities of technology for the India growth story,” MEITY Secretary Aruna Sundarajan said. “We will soon send master trainers for training under Google for app development course. NIELIT should be able to roll out this course, maybe with a token amount of less than Rs 5,000 per student. We are looking at making Indian youth more employable, fees are not a primary concern,” NIELIT DG Ashwini Kumar Sharma said. Google and NIELIT will also run digital marketing training programme to train over 100,000 artisans per year across India to help them come online and tap into newer markets through improved visibility on Internet. “Google will provide free of cost support for digital marketing course. NIELIT should be in position to start course for artisans by the end of May. We may charge a token amount for sustainability of the training for less than Rs 1,500 -2,000 per head,” Sharma said. Google India and MEITY will undertake programme to enhance the government’s online presence, especially on mobile platforms, to enable citizen engagement and training and capacity building programmes on digital tools.

Complaints which defame judiciary should be brought to the notice of the High Court Registry which in turn would inform Google and YouTube about these objectionable video clips, said the full bench headed by Chief Justice Manjula Chellur. The court was hearing a contempt petition filed by Bombay Bar Association (BBA) challenging a video clip on YouTube which purportedly showed proceedings in a courtroom of a high court and levelled allegations of corruption against the judge. BBA counsel Srihari Aney informed the court that despite its earlier order such video clips were still being uploaded on websites and that it should be immediately stopped. The bench then directed YouTube and Google to ensure that such video clips are removed immediately if brought to their notice by the high court registry. The court had earlier issued notices to YouTube and search engine Google, seeking their response as to why action for contempt of court should not be initiated against them. The petition sought contempt action against the persons who recorded and uploaded the video on YouTube levelling allegations of corruption against Justice SJ Kathawala of the high court. "The 38-minute video uploaded last week by 'Right Mirror' copies the format of a news channel and shows a person acting as anchor and taking interviews of several persons including lawyer Nilesh Ojha making scandalous remarks against judges of this high court," said the petition. A division bench of the high court had last month also ordered YouTube and other respondents to remove this video clip immediately. "Considering the scandalous and contemptuous nature of the video, we are inclined to order the respondents to forthwith remove the offending video," the court had said.

Rajan Anandan, Vice-President and Managing Director, South-East Asia and India, Google, told BusinessLine that the company is set to give brands more control over where their ads appear, and that the company itself has a rigorous brand-safety policy in place. “Brand safety will click in when you are shown ads against content that may be objectionable. Today, advertisers have a lot of control over (objectionable) political or religious content. What we are doing is increasing the number of controls, so that as a brand, you can have even more restraints at every stage and have more control over where you can show your ads,” he said. The technology company was forced to undertake a thorough review of its advertising policies and brand controls, after major US advertisers such as AT&T, Verizon and Johnson & Johnson pulled out their ads from Google and its video streaming service YouTube. In the UK, advertisers such as Marks & Spencer and HSBC have already pulled back their advertising from YouTube. The UK is Google’s second-largest market after the US. “In India, it is not an issue,” Anandan insists, “but we are being very proactive by significantly increasing controls. “So when a user sees something he does not like, he can flag it immediately. Currently, we have a certain response time, which is 24 hours (98 per cent of flagged content is reviewed within 24 hours). We are reducing that to a few hours.” Anandan said though there were “several checks and balances in place earlier, 400 hours of content is being uploaded every minute. We have a system that classifies content automatically. Sometimes, the classification does not work, and as a result, new (objectionable) content can be shown alongside ads. “We are now trying to work through that too.”Stepping up control Even as the internet giant has pledged to keep offensive and extremist content away from ads, the crisis highlights the many complexities involved in trying to moderate content on a large scale. It was also an eye-opener for Google’s India operations. As Anandan said: “What happened in the US made us realise we need to do more.” He said the company will “dramatically increase” the number of controls from the current 50-plus options. The company received “feedback from advertisers asking for more control over where the ads are shown. Even one negative impression is detrimental to the brand, and we want to avoid that” (This article was published on March 24, 2017) Post Comment Related TOPICS arts, culture and entertainment | internet | economy, business and finance | computing and information technology | internet | world wide web | Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

By Owen Hughes March 24, 2017 16:55 GMT If you haven't already downloaded Google's mapping app, you really should Google Maps is an indispensable app for navigating big cities or just trying to get from A to B with minimal hassle. But there's a lot more to Google's mapping service than basic journey planning as those of you who have spent time exploring the app will know. Features like street view and satellite imagery, you probably be familiar with. But did you know you could also use Google Maps to peek inside an active volcano? Read on for 7 things you (possibly) didn't know Google Maps could do. Share your location with friends Meeting friends in the city? You can share your location with others in real time to help them find you more easily. Using the Google Maps smartphone app, tap on the blue dot indicating your location or the menu icon in the search bar and tap 'share location'. You can then share your whereabouts with a contact for anywhere between 15 minutes to three days. Time Travel Google Maps has a Time Travel feature for desktop that lets you see how a location has changed over time. Just find a location that offers Street View, then click on the timestamp in the grey window in the upper left corner of the screen. Provided more than one Street View image exists of the place, you'll be able to see photos of the location from as far back as 2007. Look inside an active volcano Volcano spelunking isn't something to be taken lightly, but if you're really keen to peek into the earth's volatile core, Google Maps offers a way for you to do it without getting turned into a shish kebab. If you search for the Marum crater on Ambrym, which is an island in the Pacific coast east of Australia, you can get a 360-degree look at the broiling lava lake within. You can get a 360-degree view of the inside of the Marum volcano crater using Google MapsGoogle Maps See everywhere you've been If you have Google's Location History turned on and location settings set to high accuracy, you can use Google Maps to review all the places you've visited. In the Google Maps app, hit the menu button followed by 'Your timeline'. Tapping the calendar icon will let you look back on previous days' movements in unnerving detail, right down to the time you spent travelling and the shops/ bars/ cafes you visited. If this creeps you out, you can delete individual journeys from your timeline or your entire journey history. Alternatively you can just turn of Location History in your Google settings. Google will help you track down your rideScreenshot/ IBTimes UK Find your parked car A more recent addition to Google Maps is the ability to find your parked car. First, head into the Google app on Android and hit the menu button. Then go to Customise>Transport and set 'driving' as your main mode of transportation under where it says 'How do you usually commute?' From then on, whenever you get out of your car just tap the blue dot on the Google Maps app that marks your location. From there you'll be able to mark your parking spot and even add information such as which floor your car is on in the parking garage and how long you have on the meter. A timer will then count down your remaining time and notify you when the meter expires. Check the traffic Google Maps is a handy tool for checking road conditions thanks to Google's real-time traffic data. You can do this by hitting the menu icon in either the smartphone app or web version of Google Maps and scrolling down to 'Traffic'. Selecting this will place a colour-coded overlay onto the map indicating how busy the roads are, as well as any ongoing roadworks, accidents or closures happening nearby. Become a Local Guide If you're willing to give feedback on the places you visit, you can earn points from Google that can get you invitations to exclusive events, contests and early access to new Google products and features. In the Google Maps app, hit the menu button and tap on 'Your contributions'. Here you can sign up to Google's rewards programme, provided you're aged 18 or over. To earn points you simply need to provide info on the places you visit, for example verifying contact info, opening hours, whether a place is wheelchair accessible, serves good cocktails and so on. Each piece of feedback you leave for a place earns you one point; you need 500 or more to become a 'Google Insider' and get to test new products before they're publicly released.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 March 2017 by Military News Titan Platform US Names Kelly DiGregorio as Chief Content Officer and Richard Sussman as Chief Revenue Officer SANTA MONICA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Titan Platform US, a global creativity and technology development company based in Santa Monica, CA, announces the addition of digital media entertainment executives Kelly DiGregorio as Chief Content Officer and Richard Sussman as Chief Revenue Officer to head content strategy and business development for the U.S. “As we build out the US market for Titan and look to differentiate as a challenger brand, it all starts with top talent,” said Adrian Sexton, CEO, Titan Platform US. “Based on Kelly’s leadership at YouTube, Verizon, Intel and Alibaba’s Lazada, Titan will distinguish our smart content offering by giving it a defined programming voice. On the revenue side, Richard’s successes driving strategy and monetization across TiVo/Rovi, Gracenote, IPG, Nielsen and multiple start-ups will put Titan Platform on the global map for advertisers and businesses seeking to use data and video content to create more engaging consumer experiences.” Kelly DiGregorio, Chief Content Officer, comes to Titan Platform from Lazada, where she was SVP Partnerships for the Southeast Asia region. Alibaba acquired Lazada in April 2016 for $1 billion for an undisclosed majority stake. Prior to Lazada, DiGregorio was Director of Content Partnerships for Verizon Communications’ go90, joining the company as part of Verizon’s acquisition of Intel’s OnCue. DiGregorio spent six years in Content Partnerships at Google-owned YouTube, developing new business models and partnerships for digital content distributed across YouTube, GoogleTV, and Android Market/Google Play. She negotiated over 50 deals per quarter to launch YouTube’s staple AVOD partner program following Google’s acquisition, secured over 10,000 titles for the U.S. and Canada launch of Google Play TVOD/EST, and led content programming and production for over $20M in event-based brand sponsorships offered through YouTube’s on-demand and live streaming services. DiGregorio was instrumental in establishing both content and operations for Google Play, navigating partnerships with back-end partners such as Deluxe, DETE, Premiere Digital, and Rovi in addition to major studio partnerships. She was awarded the Producers Guild of America’s Digital VIP award for her work on YouTube’s first original programming fund, which developed into the video host’s $100M original channels initiative. As part of this channels initiative, DiGregorio helped incubate several new digital content networks, including the JASH comedy network (Sarah Silverman, Tim Heidecker & Eric Wareheim, Reggie Watts, Michael Cera), which has subsequently sold series to go90, Comedy Central, MTV and Syfy. At Intel’s OnCue, DiGregorio mixed digital programming deals with linear programming deals, setting the stage for OTT service MVPD rights with the broadcast and cable networks. DiGregorio’s prior work in branded media and filmed entertainment includes posts at Interpublic Group, New Line Cinema, and Warner Bros. With an initial focus on creating a curated, lean-back content experience for both U.S. and Asia, DiGregorio will lead content strategy and programming for Titan’s smart content platform across Titan’s set-top device and digital signage display network. Utilizing her experience at YouTube, DiGregorio will also work with talent, influencers and brands to develop content-enabled ecommerce that empowers programming distributed by Titan Platform with new forms of monetization. “With so many companies in the media space focused on either platform or hardware offerings, it’s inspiring from a content perspective to join a company that is forging a direct relationship between programming and distribution, and has the talent in both camps to pull it off,” said DiGregorio. “There’s a unique opportunity at Titan to curate content that enhances their ecosystem—spanning smart IoT, e-commerce and immersive entertainment experiences like VR and Cloud Karaoke.” Richard Sussman, Chief Revenue Officer for Titan Platform US, has more than eighteen years of experience as founder, board member, advisor and investor in a number of VC-funded, early-stage companies. Sussman comes to Titan from TiVo/Rovi with a proven track record in public companies including The Nielsen Company, which acquired Netratings for $328M where Sussman was revenue head. Nielsen then purchased the remaining interest in Nielsen Buzz Metrics for $47M which became Nielsen Digital where Sussman was monetization lead for its M&E business. Sussman was also business development lead at Baseline, Inc., acquired by Gracenote for $50M, and continued in this role when Tribune Media acquired Gracenote for $170M, then recently sold to Nielsen for $560M. Sussman oversaw the strategy of $500M in media spend strategy and optimization for companies like Hyundai-Kia, Logitech, PepsiCo, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, and Lionsgate Films. Sussman led partner and client growth closing several ten-digit multi-year SaaS, licensing and data solutions deals representing over 150 accounts with Google, Apple, Disney, Viacom, Netflix, NewsCorp, Samsung, Comcast and others. Sussman will lead growth strategy and monetization for Titan across the ecosystem platform with an emphasis on revenue partnerships, licensing and hardware sales for the smart set-top and display devices. He will also focus on related data discovery to inform the content and marketing offerings for the group. Sussman is building out a monetization team with key hires from Samsung and T-Mobile. “There are a lot of companies chasing platform innovations in AI, VR, IoT, and content-to-commerce services and they’re struggling to find their market position. Titan incorporates all of these diverse platforms into one agnostic ecosystem, providing media and technology gateways for home, education, medical, government and business,” said Sussman. “I’m excited to build Titan’s business solutions at this nexus of content, data and technology.” About Titan Platform US: Based in Los Angeles, Titan Platform US is creating a new ecosystem of “smarter content across smarter devices” with the clueworks set-top device which integrates IoT, Cloud Karaoke, 4K VR WiFi headsets, enhanced multimedia and content-to-commerce digital signage functionality, together with winvention, a highly encrypted and transactional smart content platform. Titan Platform US is a wholly owned subsidiary of TiTANplatform Corporation, a global technology and creativity company in the heart of Seoul, Korea. Titan delivers an innovative global ecosystem of software and hardware where ideas and art meet commerce and communication with breakthrough patented copyright protection and transactional ecommerce.

The revelation, first reported in early February by The Times of London, led media buying agency Havas to pull all its YouTube and Google Digital Network ads in the U.K. Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan, AT&T and Verizon, among others, have suspended or pulled advertising with Google as well. How online ad buying works To better understand how these ads wind up next to offensive content, it helps to understand how companies buy ads online. A brand has a product it wants to advertise. Its internal research has identified the demographic most likely to buy the product — for example 18- to 25-year-old men. The brand goes to a media agency and explains the objective. It gives the media agency a budget. The media agency does more research and determines the best ways to reach this demographic. It may find that these hypothetical 18- to 25-year-old men also are more likely to be cat lovers and eat pizza. Then it determines the best places to run the ads to reach those people. Say that media buyers decide YouTube is the best place. Here are the main ways they could buy an ad there: show chapters Want an ad on Youtube? Here’s how to do it    Thursday, 23 Mar 2017 | 6:41 PM ET | 01:01 Talk to a Google sales representative to buy ads on Google Preferred videos. These ads run on the top 2 to 5 percent of Google's videos based on such criteria as the number of views and subscribers. Typically, brands that buy Google Preferred have bigger budgets of six figures or more, according to Matt Borchard, media director at media agency Noble People. These ads are also bought in a similar manner to TV upfronts — meaning brands commit money before the videos are posted. Those with smaller budgets can still get their hands on Google Preferred-quality videos. Smaller players can do this by buying inventory that's left over after the big budget group is finished. They also contact Google sales reps to get their deals done. The budgets don't have to be as big and the ads may be cheaper, but they get the second go-around on premium videos. These sales are comparable to TV scatter markets — the sales on the remainder of programming after upfront deals are made. Most remaining ad space gets sold on Google's ad sales platform AdWords or DoubleClick. These are automated platforms that allow buyers to bid on demographics or topics, and ads are priced based on supply and demand. Media buyers set the maximum price they want to pay and which groups of people they want to reach. The platform then sells them the videos that fit their needs, based on internal Google algorithms. Buyers can also buy through third-party managed services, like Zefr or Ad Parlor. These companies have people and technology who "watch" YouTube videos and label what they are about. Media buyers can ask for a specific type of video, like videos with cats or tied to events like March Madness. The third-party service makes informed purchases on AdWords, and can provide a list of video URLs where the ads ran. However, advertisers pay more for these services — about 5 to 6 cents more for each completed view, or $3 to $4 more per 1,000 viewers, according to Borchard. This metric is called "cost per mille," or CPM. (YouTube's average CPM is $2, but it varies widely, especially when the videos reach in-demand demographics.) YouTube video creators and Google split the revenue. Splits are typically 45/55 percent, with the bigger share going to the creator. However, channels with large viewerships can sometimes negotiate better shares. It's also important to note that advertisers who buy "TrueView" ads — which are the majority of YouTube ads sold — only pay if the user watches the whole ad or after 30 seconds have passed. On the other hand, a media buyer could decide that a simple display ad is better. Display ads are text, image or video ads that appear on websites, essentially the online equivalent of print ads. Google is one of the biggest companies that "serves" online ads, meaning it owns technology that places ads on websites. Here's how those media buyers can buy display ads through Google: show chapters Here’s how to buy a display ad through Google    Thursday, 23 Mar 2017 | 6:44 PM ET | 00:25 Media buyers use Google's AdWords or DoubleClick services or direct through a Google salesperson. They can also buy "programmatically" through a third-party ad tech firm. Similar to YouTube, media buyers name their price and which demographics they want to reach. Google algorithms determine which websites would be appropriate for the goals. Ad tech firms have their own algorithms that find the best places considering cost and exposure to the right groups. The websites and Google split the ad revenue. Why Google ads can be better ... and worse In the old days, if a brand wanted to reach a certain demographic, media buyers would turn to a TV channel that they knew had a high number of viewers in that group, said Mikkel If Hansen, partner and product owner at media analytics platform Blackwood Seven. The company uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help brands make more efficient ad buys. But those ads would appear to anybody watching the TV channel, including people outside the desired demographic. Advertisers, in a sense, overpaid to reach their desired audience. Digital platforms allow brands to target only the people they want. If people are logged into their Google accounts and have entered their personal information, the company can tell their age, gender, and location data, among other aspects like search history and websites they visit. Though digital ads are more targeted and can reach more people than TV commercials, Google and other ad tech companies use computer programs rather than people to decide where to place ads, because media buyers are purchasing type of person not a specific website. It also means no one knows all the instances the ad appeared. "It's difficult for them to see what they bought because you are buying behavior and not actual placements," Hansen said. In addition, technology isn't quite good enough yet to block objectionable content instantaneously. Google can block websites tagged with offensive words, but it's harder to "see" what the videos are about, said Borchard. About 400 minutes of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute. "The sheer amount of video that is being uploaded to YouTube is mindboggling," Borchard said. In short, there's far too much content online to scan and immediately remove if deemed offensive. Companies still rely on people to tag bad content that may have slipped through their sensors. Plus, there are potential legal issues that prevent blocking content. In a blog post on Monday, Google's chief business officer Philipp Schindler apologized for the ad adjacency issues, and said the company is working to make sure that ads only show up next to creators the company can vouch for, and make it easier for advertisers to control which kinds of content their ads appear next to. Schindler also said the company will share more about where ads run, as well as act faster to take down questionable videos.

X YouTube exodus highlights problem with online advertising Several Irish brands this week pulled ads from the video-sharing service Fri, Mar 24, 2017, 15:38 The YouTube advertising controversy heightens the stakes for the company. Image: Reuters         When Google acquired YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion (€1.5 billion), it was considered a pricey gamble, one made with the belief that an online service known for pirated videos and vapid user-generated content could appeal to major advertisers. The bet paid off. YouTube is now one of the pillars of Google’s advertising business and the most valuable video platform on the internet. In recent years, advertisers, unable to ignore its massive audience, flocked to YouTube to reach younger people who have started to shun traditional broadcast television. But the technology underpinning YouTube’s advertising business has come under intense scrutiny in recent days, with AT&T, Johnson & Johnson and other deep-pocketed US marketers announcing that they would pull their ads from the service. It happened in Ireland too. Core Media, the Republic’s largest buyer of advertising said on Wednesday that it had suspended its business with Google and YouTube. The company buys on behalf of clients including Musgrave and the National Lottery. Their reason: The automated system in which ads are bought and placed online has too often resulted in brands appearing next to offensive material on YouTube such as hate speech. On Thursday, the US ride-sharing service Lyft became the latest example, removing its ads after they appeared next to videos from a racist skinhead group. “This is beyond offensive,” a Lyft spokesman, Scott Coriell, said. “As soon as we learned of it, we pulled our advertising on YouTube.” Core of appeal The pullback from advertisers strikes at the core of YouTube’s appeal. Unlike television, with specific programming during which brands choose to run their advertising, YouTube mirrors the internet’s sprawl, specialising in niche content that may not appeal to a mainstream audience but attracts engaged viewers. This provides YouTube with an enormous audience watching 1 billion hours of videos a day, perfect for new ad technology that minutely slices and dices an audience so that companies can target specific viewers. ADVERTISEMENT That technology, known as programmatic advertising, allows advertisers to lay out the general parameters of what kind of person they want to reach - say, a young man under 25 - and trust that their ad will find that person, no matter where he might be on the internet. This approach plays to the strengths of tech giants such as Google and Facebook, allowing advertisers to use automation and data to cheaply and efficiently reach their own audiences, funnelling money through a complicated system of agencies and third-party networks. But more than 400 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute, and while Google has noted that it prevents ads from running near inappropriate material “in the vast majority of cases,” it has proved unable to totally police that amount of content in real time. And that has advertisers increasingly concerned. “The simple truth is that the same tech that allows the posting of a recipe, the joyous video of a child or the exposure of an excessive act from law enforcement allows the creation, posting or sharing of the video of a murder,” Rob Norman, chief digital officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of advertising giant WPP, wrote this week in Campaign, a trade publication. Programmatic advertising Marketers have seen programmatic advertising as a groundbreaking development in media - a technologically efficient way to leverage the expanse of the internet so that, for example, Pampers can reach a new parent on a local blog or an instructional video about how to deal with a newborn’s baby acne. This has opened up the whole of the internet to brands, which typically opt to remove their ads after they have appeared on unsavoury sites, rather than restrict the ads to a list of preapproved locations. That sheer scale, coupled with its reliance on algorithms rather than humans to filter out the objectionable content after it appears, has been Google’s main defence. More than 2 million websites are a part of its display advertising network . “What we do is, we match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match. We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time, and so I think we’re going to be OK,” Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said in an interview Thursday with Fox Business Network. While brands have expressed concern about showing up next to unsavoury photos and videos uploaded to digital platforms by users - such as pornography on Snapchat - the situation with YouTube is particularly jarring. YouTube splits advertising revenue with its users, meaning advertisers risk directly funding creators of hateful, misogynistic or terrorism-related content. The stakes There’s a lot at stake for YouTube and Alphabet. Search advertising is not growing as fast as it once did, and television ad budgets are still larger than total spending on digital advertising. YouTube and Facebook have made no secret of their desire for television advertising funds. Internet ad revenue in the US, which is growing quickly, reached about $60 billion in 2015 while television accounted for about $66 billion, according to a study from IAB and PwC. James Dix, a senior media analyst at US company Wedbush Securities, estimates that YouTube accounted for revenue of about $13 billion, or roughly 20 per cent of all advertising revenue on Google’s internet properties in 2016. Alphabet does not disclose YouTube revenue. “If this company is going to look for new growth at scale, it has to pull money from television,” Mr Dix said. “Period.” ADVERTISEMENT -(New York Times Service)       Topics: Eric Schmidt James Dix Rob Norman Scott Coriell Alphabet Core Media Facebook Google J&J Musgrave National Lottery PwC WPP Wedbush Securities YouTube Read More RTÉ plans up to 250 redundancies and eyes licence fee reform ‘Adapt or die’ time for RTÉ, but what does its future look like?

One of the best ways to ensure you never lose them is by backing them up. Thankfully, there are tons of useful tools that let you make backups of all the photos on your PC. We’ve listed our top eight. All the services mentioned have corresponding websites and/or apps that let you access your photos as soon as they’re backed up, which usually takes a few seconds. While our list contains many familiar names, there are a few tools that may not be as common, but have features worth exploring. Most of the tools provide gigabytes worth of storage space for free, but there are a few subscription services. To help you make an informed decision, we have added our verdict after each tool so you can determine whether it best suits your needs. 1. Google Photos Desktop Uploader Free Storage Space: 15 GB (includes Google Drive and Gmail) It’s hard to imagine that Google Photos has been around for less than two years because it’s become an indispensable backup tool to many. During setup, the app gives you the option to back up photos and videos saved in various PC locations (including your desktop, devices you connect to your PC, and the My Pictures folder). You can also add other PC locations whose photos you want to back up. Google Photos has two photo size options: High quality reduces the file size of your original photos but gives you unlimited storage space, while Original counts against your storage space but files will be uploaded in their original size. As Google gives you a generous 15 GB of free storage space, I recommend selecting Original to enjoy your photos in the way you’ve snapped them. Hint: You can always create and use a second Google account to double this storage space. Alternatively, you can buy more storage space. Plans start at $1.99 per month for 100 GB or $9.99 per month for 1 TB. We’ve explained how you can make Google Photos work for you How to Make Google Photos Work for You with These Tips How to Make Google Photos Work for You with These Tips Google Photos could be the much-awaited solution to manage all your photos.

Using Google Photos will ensure that your favorite moments are saved for a long time to come Read More . Verdict: Google Photos is a fantastic tool for the everyday smartphone user. It has a generous amount of storage space and gives you the option to organize and edit your files across a wide range of devices. 2. Flickr Pro Free Storage Space: 1 TB Although its popularity has waned in the last few years, Flickr still remains a great place to display your photos because of its loyal and enthusiastic photographer base. A free account gets you a humongous 1 TB of storage, but you’ll need to upload photos via its website. To back up photos on your PC, you’ll need to sign up for a Pro account (starting at $5.99 per month or $49.99 a year). This lets you install and use its Desktop Auto-Uploadr tool. It also promises an ad-free browsing experience and gives you advanced stats on your photos — including which photos are currently trending and what’s driving people to your photos. Apart from hosting your photos, Flickr has other useful features More Than Photo Sharing: 5 Unique Uses For Flickr More Than Photo Sharing: 5 Unique Uses For Flickr Flickr is best known as one of the easiest ways to share and store your photos online.

If you... Read More . This is handy if you want to back them up somewhere else. Verdict: Even though it comes at a slight cost, a Flickr Pro subscription makes sense if you’re an avid photographer because it’ll back up all your high-resolution photos with ease. 3. Photo Transfer App Storage Space: Not mentioned (requires Pro subscription) There are many apps that let you instantly send photos from one device to another. However, Photo Transfer App (yes, that’s what it’s called) is the only one we know of that that also lets you back-up your photos. By default, the app lets you transfer five files at a time for free. Upgrading to its Pro version (which costs $4.99) removes this limit and gives you the option to back up photos on your PC. You can set your folder backup path by clicking its Settings icon at the bottom-right of the program. It’s easy to transfer any photos you’ve backed up to your PC to the Photo Transfer app on your devices. Just use the Discover Devices button on the program. The program will detect any devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network and let you transfer the photos you want. Verdict: Photo Transfer App took a while to detect our devices. However, it’s useful if you want to back up photos from your Amazon devices and a Mac because most of the other tools don’t support those devices. Cloud Storage Options There are many familiar, free, and reliable cloud storage services that back up your photos. The ones mentioned below all work in a similar way. They add useful PC folders, desktop shortcuts, and icons in your PC’s taskbar for easy access. This notification area icon is important because it also lets you access the program’s Preferences (or Settings) section from where you can check and change its default behaviors. The best part about using a cloud storage service is that backing up photos is mostly just a case of dropping them into the relevant folder that you want. After that’s done, you can instantly access all your photos from another PC that has the same program, the respective tool’s website, or its free Android and iOS apps. 4. Google Drive Free Storage Space: 15 GB (includes Google Photos and Gmail) If you prefer using a cloud storage option instead of Google Photos, then Google Drive is your best bet. Installing the program also adds Google’s Office-equivalent tools (Docs, Sheets, and Slides) on your PC. Unlike Google Photos, it’ll start downloading all the files in your Google Drive account to your PC, so you can access them at your convenience. You can change which of these files you want to download using the Preferences option in your PC’s notification area. We’ve written a detailed guide on Google Drive The Only Google Drive Guide You'll Ever Need to Read The Only Google Drive Guide You'll Ever Need to Read Google Drive is the perfect combination of online file storage and document management tools. We explain how to best use Google Drive on- and offline, by yourself and in collaboration with others.

Find everything easier with our help. Google's search operators can find almost anything, including text in images (OCR) or photos based on content, e.g. your dog. Read More . Verdict: It’s a good alternative to Google Photos and brilliant if you’re tied into Google’s ecosystem because it comes pre-installed on all Android devices and Chromebooks. 5. OneDrive Free Storage Space: 5 GB Microsoft’s default cloud storage service comes pre-installed on all Windows 10 PCs. For earlier versions, it’s easy to install as a separate program. Right-click its PC notification icon, then click Settings. Here, you’ll see options to automatically save photos and videos to your OneDrive account whenever you connect a device to your PC. This screen’s tabs also has options to let you select which folders’ files you want to back up, save media files from devices you connect to your PC, and automatically save your screenshots to OneDrive. Recently Microsoft has improved the service. The best example of this is its web and app interfaces that now have a dedicated Photos section where you’ll find all the photos you backed up, neatly arranged by date. We’ve told you how to best use OneDrive your Windows 10 PC How to Substitute OneDrive Smart Files in Windows 10 How to Substitute OneDrive Smart Files in Windows 10 Microsoft broke OneDrive on Windows 10 for power users. The removal of placeholders, also known as smart files, has disappointed many users who upgraded from Windows 8.1. We have compiled several workarounds. Read More . Verdict: It’s probably a default app on your PC, so you might as well put its 5 GB of storage space to good use. 6. Dropbox Free Storage Space: 2 GB Dropbox was one of the earliest cloud-storage programs. Even today, it’s still a competent service despite offering the least amount of free storage space. Maybe that’s because it’s constantly adding useful new features 15 Things You Didn’t Know You Could Do with Dropbox 15 Things You Didn’t Know You Could Do with Dropbox Cloud storage services have come and gone, but Dropbox is probably the one that's been here the longest. And now it has upped its game with a host of new features. Let's explore. Read More . Its PC notification icon displays all your recent notifications and files you’ve uploaded (or made changes to) in a list. You can even copy the link for any of these files to quickly share it with others. Its Preferences section (also accessible through the notification icon) lets you automatically upload your photos, videos, and screenshots to the service. Verdict: The default storage space it offers remains its only major Achilles heel. Otherwise, it’s a flawless program. 7. iCloud Free Storage Space: 5 GB Anything that starts with a small “i” is obviously Apple-related. Thankfully, iCloud works on Windows PCs too. The program takes a few minutes to install and you’ll need to restart your PC to complete the installation. Annoyingly, iCloud also installs some of Apple’s additional junk, but that’s probably a small price to pay if you’re tied into the Apple ecosystem. We’ve explained how to use it to sync data between your iPhone and Windows PC How to Use the iCloud Control Panel to Sync Data Between Your iPhone & Windows How to Use the iCloud Control Panel to Sync Data Between Your iPhone & Windows Do you regularly work on a Windows computer. And are you looking for a way to keep your iPhone data in sync? The iCloud Control Panel could be the tool you've been looking for. Read More . Verdict: Even though it’s a good service, it’s only worth using if you mainly use Apple devices and a Windows PC. 8. Amazon Drive Free Storage Space: 5 GB (requires Amazon Prime subscription) Amazon Prime users have tons of benefits 6 Amazon Prime Benefits You Might Be Ignoring Right Now 6 Amazon Prime Benefits You Might Be Ignoring Right Now Scratch the surface. Amazon Prime has so many more benefits that people have forgotten about or simply don't realize exist. Read More . One of the most underrated is Amazon Drive, which gives you 5 GB of storage space for your photos, videos, and other files. When you first install Amazon Drive you can choose which PC folders you want to sync with your account. Confusingly, it has a service called Prime Photos which are only available as Android and iOS apps. This has unlimited photo storage space and is a better place to back up and organize photos on your device. But because it’s not available as a separate PC program, you’ll need to manage any photos you’ve uploaded via the apps using the Amazon Drive program. Verdict: Amazon Drive’s photo search tools are under-baked compared to some of the other options on this list. That said, Prime Photos is a great option for backing up photos on your devices. What’s Your Favorite Backup Tool? While our personal favorite photo backup program is Google Photos, each of the tools we mentioned give you different ways to achieve the same result. They all work as advertised and serve slightly different purposes. Ultimately, which service you find useful all comes down to few deciding factors — namely storage space, convenience, and familiarity. The best part about having such a wide variety of reliable photo backup tools at your disposal is that you can easily use multiple services or multiple accounts on the same service to instantly maximize your storage space. Which of these PC tools do you consider invaluable for backing up your photos? Is there a useful program we missed? Let us know by posting your thoughts in the comments section below.

The PM weighed into the heated row yesterday to insist it is not enough for social media to just take down dangerous material when it is found. PA:Press Association 6 Number 10 says hate material should never be allowed to be posed on Google in the first place It also emerged last night that No10 is prepared to look at a new criminal offence of ‘failing to act’ to remove terror manuals and other dangerous content if internet companies don’t change their ways. The California-based search giant that owns YouTube sparked outrage for not removing terror manuals for ‘lone wolf’ attacks even after the bloodbath in Westminster. They include sick guides on how to pull off vehicle-borne attacks similar to the carnage wrought by twisted terrorist Khalid Masood on Wednesday.

Branding the radical material “incredibly serious”, Chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee Damian Collins told the Evening Standard: “We expect them to spot and identify it proactively and to remove it when it is brought to their attention. “There should be an obligation to do that and I think we should look at whether there should be a new offence of failing to act on content that spreads messages of hate or seeks to radicalise people.” PA:Press Association 6 Khalid Masood struck terror in the heart of the capital on Wednesday For more on this story listen to Penny Smith from 8am Listen on DAB, via the talkRADIO app or online at talkradio.co.uk The proposal may be recommended in a forthcoming report by the committee on a wider inquiry into the challenges posed by social media and the Internet. Responding to the suggestion, the PM’s official spokesman said: “The ball is now in their court. “Let’s see how they respond.” But a government source added: “The companies know what we expect. “If they don’t do it, we will then decide our next move is, but we wouldn’t rule out legislation.” Met Police Federation chairman Ken Marsh said internet companies should accept responsibility for material they carry such as terrorism manuals. Getty Images 6 Mr Marsh said: “Internet companies have 150 per cent a social responsibility to assist in the prevention of terrorism or violence. “These documents should be removed immediately if they encourage people to perform violence.” Manuals found on Google, Facebook and Twitter include a step-by-step guide, released in November, in the ISIS terror group’s Rumiyah magazine. It suggested using vehicles as “tools of war”, before going on a stabbing outrage. Google is already at the centre of a row over advertising revenue going to terrorists and other extremists. Big brands like M&S have pulled ads from Google and its sister site YouTube after they were appearing next to videos and blogs spouting hate. HOST TO JIHADIS AND RACISTS FIRMS including M&S,  Heinz, the BBC, Lloyds and RBS pulled  ads from Google after they  appeared next to extremist videos. A TERROR manual found with  a  Google search urges jihadists to target Westerners using cars and knives from DIY stores as “tools of war”. A CONSPIRACY website claiming Barack Obama is planning a coup was highlighted by Google’s smart speaker device. GOOGLE  refused to remove a clip of ex-Ku Klux Klan chief David Duke from YouTube despite admitting it was anti-semitic.   The Sun Topics Theresa May Facebook Google London terror attack 2017 Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Comments Most Popular STEPOSAURUS World's largest dinosaur footprint discovered Down Under... and it's as big as a man News YOUTUBE VIDEO NASTIES Sickos trick kids into watching scary videos by disguising them as Peppa Pig clips News 'HERE COMES THE BACKLASH' Katie Price posts picture of 9-year-old Princess posing in a bikini on holiday TV & Showbiz END OF AN ERA The Inbetweeners star Simon Bird reveals there won't be any more films or spin off specials TV & Showbiz Back to Reality Dad of six who swapped lives with millionaire family for Rich House, Poor House came home to find letter… Living KIM IN THE CROSSHAIRS Japan to 'bomb North Korea' in missile strike before despot Kim Jong-un can 'destroy' the country News RUDE LANGSFORD Ruth Langsford accidentally shares VERY explicit picture on Twitter in Mother's Day post TV & Showbiz Exclusive EBOY RACER Mum's hilarious eBay ad to flog ex husband's 'annoying boy racer car' goes viral as she pokes fun at his manhood Living GET THE STOPWATCH OUT Sex survey reveals how long couples last in bed... and it may not be as long as you think Living STAGE FLIGHT!

Shanthi Rexaline , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} March 24, 2017 11:36am   Comments Share: Related GOOG Stifel Initiates Snap Inc At Hold YouTube Advertiser Protest: How Much Is Fake Outrage, How Much Is Real? Google's 4%+ Weekly Drop Meaningless In The Grand Scheme Of Things (Seeking Alpha) Related GOOGL Stifel Initiates Snap Inc At Hold YouTube Advertiser Protest: How Much Is Fake Outrage, How Much Is Real? Stocks Dive On Health Reform Stumble: Financials, Steel Take Hits (Investor's Business Daily) Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been drawing flak from its advertisers for allowing hate messages/offensive content to be displayed alongside ads from these companies. Speedy Resolution Likely Commenting on the development, Pacific Crest Securities, a unit of KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in a note released on Thursday said the issue is temporary in nature and could be resolved soon. Analysts Andy Hargreaves and Evan Wingren noted that several European advertisers have reportedly pulled their YouTube advertising in the last week and the week before. Some U.S. advertisers, including AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), have also followed suit. Pacific Crest Securities pointed out the contention of the advertisers is that hateful or offensive content is being associated with their brands. The firm believes it is an industry-wide problem that comes with the scale and complexity of digital advertising. The firm said, notwithstanding the current development, there is no denying that deteriorating linear TV viewership is forcing a shift of ad dollars and that YouTube has the most quality video inventory of anyone. Existing Solutions Can Only Get Better "We think with Google's acknowledgement of the issue, and the vast resources it has to fix it, that there will be an effective solution in place in short order," the firm said. The firm clarified that Google already has ad products like Google Preferred that allow advertisers choose a subset of content partners to associate with and various other tools. Given that there are already solutions in place, the firm thinks these will only get better. The firm thinks it is in the best interest of Google that it puts in place more tools and techniques to give advertisers more control. No Material Impact Expected The firm does not expect this to meaningfully impact Google's advertising revenues. The firm also noted that most ad revenues are bought on well-defined metrics and ROI profiles and that the ROI will remain solid as long as customers are on the platform. "So, unless the bad press causes people to stop using Google services (unlikely), then our estimates should not be meaningfully impacted," the firm stated. Concluding, Pacific Crest Securities said it would be buyers of the shares of the company on the weakness triggered by the development. The firm has an Overweight rating on the shares of Google and a $1,040 price target, suggesting roughly 24 percent upside from current levels.

Sleevi says that the Google Chrome team has been investigating Symantec Corporation’s failures to properly validate certificates for the last two months, and they concluded that at least 30,000 certificates have been misissued by them." — Update / Symantec Backs Its CA: Symantec today published a blog post strongly objecting to Google's action – "We strongly object to the action Google has taken to target Symantec SSL/TLS certificates in the Chrome browser. This action was unexpected, and we believe the blog post was irresponsible. ... Google’s statements about our issuance practices and the scope of our past mis-issuances are exaggerated and misleading. ... We have taken extensive remediation measures to correct this situation, immediately terminated the involved partner’s appointment as a registration authority (RA), and in a move to strengthen the trust of Symantec-issued SSL/TLS certificates, announced the discontinuation of our RA program. This control enhancement is an important move that other public certificate authorities (CAs) have not yet followed. While all major CAs have experienced SSL/TLS certificate mis-issuance events, Google has singled out the Symantec Certificate Authority in its proposal even though the mis-issuance event identified in Google’s blog post involved several CAs." — Symantec vs. Google: The CA Fight Continues. What do you need to know? Johannes Ullrich / March 27: "Regardless if we agree or do not agree with Google's action on this, here are some of the issues you need to be aware off: 1. Right now, this is just a proposal. Nothing has been implemented yet, and Google may change its mind, or change its schedule. 2. This issue will only affect Google Chrome users. Google Chrome is by some counts currently the most commonly used browser. But it will only affect HTTP(S), not other services like imap that are not supported by Chrome. It will also not affect internal web services that are not used by browsers..."

Kelly DiGregorio, Chief Content Officer, Titan Platform US (Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Richard Sussman, Chief Revenue Officer, Titan Platform US (Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail March 24, 2017 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Titan Platform US, a global creativity and technology development company based in Santa Monica, CA, announces the addition of digital media entertainment executives Kelly DiGregorio as Chief Content Officer and Richard Sussman as Chief Revenue Officer to head content strategy and business development for the U.S. “As we build out the US market for Titan and look to differentiate as a challenger brand, it all starts with top talent,” said Adrian Sexton, CEO, Titan Platform US. “Based on Kelly’s leadership at YouTube, Verizon, Intel and Alibaba’s Lazada, Titan will distinguish our smart content offering by giving it a defined programming voice. On the revenue side, Richard’s successes driving strategy and monetization across TiVo/Rovi, Gracenote, IPG, Nielsen and multiple start-ups will put Titan Platform on the global map for advertisers and businesses seeking to use data and video content to create more engaging consumer experiences.” Kelly DiGregorio, Chief Content Officer, comes to Titan Platform from Lazada, where she was SVP Partnerships for the Southeast Asia region. Alibaba acquired Lazada in April 2016 for $1 billion for an undisclosed majority stake. Prior to Lazada, DiGregorio was Director of Content Partnerships for Verizon Communications’ go90, joining the company as part of Verizon’s acquisition of Intel’s OnCue. DiGregorio spent six years in Content Partnerships at Google-owned YouTube, developing new business models and partnerships for digital content distributed across YouTube, GoogleTV, and Android Market/Google Play. She negotiated over 50 deals per quarter to launch YouTube’s staple AVOD partner program following Google’s acquisition, secured over 10,000 titles for the U.S. and Canada launch of Google Play TVOD/EST, and led content programming and production for over $20M in event-based brand sponsorships offered through YouTube’s on-demand and live streaming services. DiGregorio was instrumental in establishing both content and operations for Google Play, navigating partnerships with back-end partners such as Deluxe, DETE, Premiere Digital, and Rovi in addition to major studio partnerships. She was awarded the Producers Guild of America’s Digital VIP award for her work on YouTube’s first original programming fund, which developed into the video host’s $100M original channels initiative. As part of this channels initiative, DiGregorio helped incubate several new digital content networks, including the JASH comedy network (Sarah Silverman, Tim Heidecker & Eric Wareheim, Reggie Watts, Michael Cera), which has subsequently sold series to go90, Comedy Central, MTV and Syfy. At Intel’s OnCue, DiGregorio mixed digital programming deals with linear programming deals, setting the stage for OTT service MVPD rights with the broadcast and cable networks. DiGregorio’s prior work in branded media and filmed entertainment includes posts at Interpublic Group, New Line Cinema, and Warner Bros. With an initial focus on creating a curated, lean-back content experience for both U.S. and Asia, DiGregorio will lead content strategy and programming for Titan’s smart content platform across Titan’s set-top device and digital signage display network. Utilizing her experience at YouTube, DiGregorio will also work with talent, influencers and brands to develop content-enabled ecommerce that empowers programming distributed by Titan Platform with new forms of monetization. “With so many companies in the media space focused on either platform or hardware offerings, it’s inspiring from a content perspective to join a company that is forging a direct relationship between programming and distribution, and has the talent in both camps to pull it off,” said DiGregorio. “There’s a unique opportunity at Titan to curate content that enhances their ecosystem—spanning smart IoT, e-commerce and immersive entertainment experiences like VR and Cloud Karaoke.” Richard Sussman, Chief Revenue Officer for Titan Platform US, has more than eighteen years of experience as founder, board member, advisor and investor in a number of VC-funded, early-stage companies. Sussman comes to Titan from TiVo/Rovi with a proven track record in public companies including The Nielsen Company, which acquired Netratings for $328M where Sussman was revenue head. Nielsen then purchased the remaining interest in Nielsen Buzz Metrics for $47M which became Nielsen Digital where Sussman was monetization lead for its M&E business. Sussman was also business development lead at Baseline, Inc., acquired by Gracenote for $50M, and continued in this role when Tribune Media acquired Gracenote for $170M, then recently sold to Nielsen for $560M. Sussman oversaw the strategy of $500M in media spend strategy and optimization for companies like Hyundai-Kia, Logitech, PepsiCo, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, and Lionsgate Films. Sussman led partner and client growth closing several ten-digit multi-year SaaS, licensing and data solutions deals representing over 150 accounts with Google, Apple, Disney, Viacom, Netflix, NewsCorp, Samsung, Comcast and others. Sussman will lead growth strategy and monetization for Titan across the ecosystem platform with an emphasis on revenue partnerships, licensing and hardware sales for the smart set-top and display devices. He will also focus on related data discovery to inform the content and marketing offerings for the group. Sussman is building out a monetization team with key hires from Samsung and T-Mobile. “There are a lot of companies chasing platform innovations in AI, VR, IoT, and content-to-commerce services and they’re struggling to find their market position. Titan incorporates all of these diverse platforms into one agnostic ecosystem, providing media and technology gateways for home, education, medical, government and business,” said Sussman. “I’m excited to build Titan’s business solutions at this nexus of content, data and technology.” About Titan Platform US: Based in Los Angeles, Titan Platform US is creating a new ecosystem of “smarter content across smarter devices” with the clueworks set-top device which integrates IoT, Cloud Karaoke, 4K VR WiFi headsets, enhanced multimedia and content-to-commerce digital signage functionality, together with winvention, a highly encrypted and transactional smart content platform.

 Google wants to use its AI Assistant to get all your gadgets to talk to each other Julien Rath Mar. 24, 2017, 11:15 AM 2,152 facebook linkedin twitter email print Behshad Behzadi, distinguished engineer at Google in Zurich. Vimeo LONDON – Google is experimenting with the use of its voice-controlled Assistant as a way to control every device a user owns. In an interview with Business Insider at Advertising Week Europe, Behshad Behzadi, an engineer working on conversational search at Google, described how Assistant could perform actions on a device other than the one where it's activated. "We're working on all different types of outputs," Behzadi said. "Quick voice output is really the best thing for many use cases, but we understand that in some use cases a screen is necessary." "Now that screen you can think of it whether it's a small screen, medium screen, or a larger screen. For example, Google Home is well connected to the Chromecast. For many things you want to cast it on your TV." Behzadi said he was working on identifying the use cases for how such an ecosystem of devices would work. "But then you have to ask yourself if I want a timer, do I want it on a bigger screen? Perhaps not," he said. "We're still in the early stages and we're experimenting with all those possible outputs." At CES in January 2017, Google announced it was bringing its Assistant to Android TV, but can only be activated through the TV, not from another device. In February 2017 Amazon launched a version of its TV streaming gadget, Fire TV stick, which had Alexa built in. And in November 2016 the Seattle based company was rumored to be developing a version of its Alexa speaker with a screen. Behzadi said it wouldn't be necessary for Google Home because users can get on-screen responses through a variety of Google devices, but didn't rule out the possibility. Long term, he doesn't believe voice will replace smartphones: "We're seeing more and more scenarios where the non-screen experience is suitable but both screen and non-screen will continue to be significant for a long time."

It’s Google searches. That’s according to Macquarie analysts who say that in a stock-picker’s world, an uptick in exploration via the world’s biggest advertising company is a good sign that a retailer is gaining strength. Google trends signaled a revenue rebound in Kering SA-owned Gucci about three months before the acceleration in both 2012 and 2016, Macquarie analysts including Daniele Gianera said. They also tipped a slowdown in Salvatore Ferragamo SpA sales six to nine months before it happened in 2015, they said. Ferragamo shares fell more than 30 percent from an April peak through mid-November that year. Current rising stars include LVMH, Moncler SpA, Prada SpA, Tiffany & Co. and Kering, with the first two trading more cheaply than their peer group, according to Macquarie. Prada has one of the highest correlations between Google searches and revenue growth, while Moncler is in the top two in Google growth trends showing “increasing consumers’ interest in the brand.” Global luxury has been in a “structural slowdown” since 2014, the Macquarie analysts wrote. This environment produces a “market share game” where “growth can be achieved only by improving conversion of existing store networks and increasing penetration of e-commerce operations,” they said. Viewing trends on Google -- although volatile and extremely seasonal -- can be a good indicator of a brand’s “temperature,” the analysts said. They see these trends becoming more solid over time as consumers make more purchases online. For a Bloomberg Intelligence report on Luxury Goods topics, click here In February 2017, Gucci was the brand with the highest annual increase in interest, followed by Fendi SpA and LVMH. This highlights the strength of LVMH’s two largest brands in fashion and leather, said the analysts, who see this continuing in 2017. Kering also comes out positive for most of its brands. The analysts look at previous revenue growth and compare to Google search trends to establish the relationship between the data points. They then look for both a positive correlation and an increase in Google searches to assign a company a positive score. The only one for which they found no correlation was Kering’s YSL, which they say is due to the mix between core and beauty. Ferragamo is not showing a turnaround yet, with search interest dropping off and “at least six months before the brand will be able to record a visible change in demand.” Burberry Group Plc may be active on social media and even iTunes, but it’s still negative in Google searches, they said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Adding new features like saving videos to view offline, background playback and more. We get a lot of questions about YouTube content, but this is the biggest one. Here we’ll explain how to save or download YouTube videos and music to an Android device. To be clear, Google doesn’t approve of users downloading videos or music from YouTube to their Android devices, as that is technically piracy. However, they do allow certain videos to be temporarily saved on a device for offline playback. It’s limited to a short amount of time though. Not permanent. Read: How to Listen to YouTube Videos on iPhone Without Video The offline playback feature is one users asked about for a while, and arrived in late 2014. Many have enjoyed it for some time, but in 2016 it was pushed to a paid version of YouTube. It’s called YouTube Red, and for a small fee you can get this feature. Or, just follow our instructions below. There are plenty of apps available like YouTube Ripper that will pull content to download and save. As we said moments ago, this is illegal and Google or Apple quickly remove these types of apps from the store. Many mentioned in our comment section are no longer available either. We’ll say this one more time. Using some of the apps or services below are illegal. Google doesn’t allow users to steal content from YouTube. Whether that be video or audio. It’s against the rules to copy it to your device. That said, it is still very easy to do. Users can save entire videos to their device, or even pull music right from a video. Then download the MP3 file to an Android smartphone or tablet. Instructions First off we’ll explain the legal and Google-allowed system, which is saving videos for later playback. Certain videos that support this feature will have a download arrow just below the video on Android devices. Sadly this feature is now limited to YouTube Red subscribers. Tap the arrow and select a resolution or quality you’d like to save, and that’s it. Now just go into the menu bar on the left and select “Watch later” to find the list of saved videos to enjoy. These can be played without an internet connection. However, if you want to download a video or song permanently, that is an option as well. There are plenty of apps available to rip content from YouTube directly to your Android device. Rather than link to apps that aren’t available from the Google Play Store, or from shady sources, we’ve gathered a few simple websites that will do this for you. All users need is the URL from YouTube and a few clicks will download the song or video. While viewing a YouTube video just tap the 3-dotted “Share” button and on the popup that appears select “Copy URL”. Some versions it’s an arrow that stands for share. This is what you need, then navigate to websites like YouTubeMP3.to or clipconverter.cc and paste in that link. Usually within seconds they’ll convert the video, and deliver a MP3 of the music. Including a full video clip for the user to download and save to their Android smartphone or tablet. The first one has a slew of output options too. Copy and paste the URL into a site like YouTubeMP3 and simply hit convert, then download. From here you’re all done and the song has been saved to your smartphone or tablet. Other Details This same process is very easy to do from a PC or laptop, but just as easy on Android smartphones and tablets. Clipconverter even lets you select the conversion format to suite any occasion or need. Read: How to Create Custom Ringtones for Android Searching for “video downloader” or “Youtube Downloader” on the Google Play Store may find some results. Most have been removed as of early 2017. Instead use what’s mentioned above rather than apps. Don’t download any application for Android that claims to do this if it isn’t on the Google Play Store. Third party sources aren’t typically safe. Give it a try today and download some music or videos. Now users can enjoy any video, or the latest music to create your own custom ringtones with our how to above. Again, proceed at your own risk and enjoy. 37 Responses 09/16/2015 Orenko Reply Much easier with: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chaweng.tubedownloader 06/02/2016 David Reply Watching youtube offline on mobile is really nice to kill boring time.

Google, the U.S. multinational technology company best known for its ubiquitous, eponymous search engine, is in a new business: tagging the Internet’s search results of alternative views of the historical event known as the “Holocaust.” But it’s not just “Holocaust” revisionists Google’s after, but all “Jew haters,” “white supremacists,” and “racists”—or at least trying to ensure that Internet searches do not end up at websites Google has classified as such. The UK’s Guardian reported on March 15, “Google is using a 10,000-strong army of independent contractors to flag ‘offensive or upsetting’ content, in order to ensure that queries like ‘did the Holocaust happen’ don’t push users to misinformation, propaganda, and hate speech.” Although Google’s contractors have been utilizing a manual, titled “Search Quality Rating Guidelines,” at least since 2013, “describing every potential problem they could find with a given search query,” a new update to the book orders the censors to “flag” search results that could be “upsetting” or “offensive” to Web surfers. Bug Out While You Still Can! Learn More… Speaking of whiners, NBC News interviewed head-whiner of the hopelessly corrupt Southern Poverty Law Center, Heidi Beirich, who moaned to Google a few months ago “to update its algorithm to remove a result from a neo-Nazi website questioning whether the Holocaust happened.” She told the fake news outlet about Google: “They’re moving away from self-reporting, relying on the public to tell you where there’s problems, and they’re talking about a systematic policy.” The new system will not affect search results, but will, according to Google, be “used by Google to help judge the success of algorithm changes and . . . to train its machine-learning systems.” Yup, that’s right, artificial intelligence systems that ban human critical thinking. Google—already scorned for its abuse of privacy, tax avoidance, antitrust behavior, censorship, and search neutrality—has been under additional pressure lately by critics claiming that its searches “promote extremist content.” The UK’s Guardian and Observer published a series of articles promoting this view recently, as well as complaining that it fails “to keep fake news and propaganda off the top of search results.” Of course, “fake news” is in the eye of the beholder. Founded in 1996 and valued last year at over $133 billion, Google is now the largest subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., which has acquired over 200 companies since last December. Alphabet’s most well-known brand besides Google is YouTube, the video sharing tech company, acquired in 2006. YouTube is also notorious for its censorship of videos that threaten the powers-that-be.

Dave Gahary, a former submariner in the U.S. Navy, is the host of AFP’s “Underground Interview” series. See www.americanfreepress.net for more. Previous article Next article 4 Comments on Google Scrubs Politically Incorrect Sites from Searches Pat Kittle March 28, 2017 at 04:38 The “Holocaust” extortion racket (Norman Finkelstein’s term) absolutely cannot bear close scrutiny, and so much of what’s wrong with the world today depends on it. That is at the core of the current round of censorship. Just this month I was banned from local newspapers AND Amazon. The only violation I’m guilty of is questioning what absolutely must not be questioned. Lol March 25, 2017 at 03:32 Good article. Maybe Google simply needs more Feedback. Steve Carr March 24, 2017 at 19:14 I’m shocked that google is censoring search results. The future is alternative search engines. We all need to us another search engine and than we take away the governments power, or we just go back to yelling loud try Lookseek com search or one of the other alternative searches. Richard Keefe March 24, 2017 at 17:33 Ironically, Floyd Corkins, the gay activist who attacked the Family Research Council in 2013, in an effort to “kill as many people as possible” according to CNN, picked his target from a Google search of “anti-gay organizations” that led him to the Southern Poverty Law Center website. “Corkins — who had chosen the research council as his target after finding it listed as an anti-gay group on the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center — had planned to stride into the building and open fire on the people inside in an effort to kill as many as possible, he told investigators, according to the court documents.” http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/06/justice/dc-family-research-council-shooting/ Naturally, Dr. Beirich and her company swore that there was “nothing to see here” when a homicidal maniac was traced to their company’s website. 1 Trackbacks & Pingbacks Google Scrubs Politically Incorrect Sites from Searches Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The email, posted in its entirety on Reddit, says that Google will cut the option from the app on May 22nd, and will prompt users to find a new default messaging service beforehand.  Users of Hangouts’ Android app will see a message from March 27th informing them of the upcoming removal of SMS functions. If they have another chat app installed, Hangouts will ask them to select it as the default; if they don’t, the app will direct them to the Google Play Store to find a new alternative. For Google Voice users, it’s a little more complicated: people who send carrier SMS messages via Hangouts will no longer have the option to do so from May 22nd, but those who just send SMS via their Google Voice numbers will be able to continue as before. Quotes in the article SMS Co Ltd 2175 ▲ 2,811.00 +83.00 +3.04% The change comes as Google shifts Hangouts’ focus, repositioning the messaging service to take on workplace communications tool Slack. While the removal of a feature isn’t usually cause for celebration, it’s probably a wise move in a world where Google already has a dizzying array of chat apps — including mobile-only video-centric Duo, text-based chat app Allo, and the recently announced Android Messages. It’s this last app that’s designed to handle Google’s consumer SMS service, and it’s probably a good idea to download it now, ahead of time, if you’re still using Hangouts for your texts.

Lystable, an enterprise start-up that enables businesses to manage freelance staff, has secured the money from PayPal founder Peter Thiel's Valar Ventures, Goldcrest Capital, Kindred Capital, Glynn Capital and Wilmont Ventures. Founder Peter Johnston, who is from Carrickfergus, is returning to his roots and creating 10 jobs with the new company office at the former Ormeau Baths. The 28-year-old, a past pupil of Carrickfergus Grammar School who studied PR and multimedia at Ulster University, began his career with Google. Lystable boasts more than 60 clients, among them big names like Google, Airbnb and MTV, and has annual revenues of between $1.5m (£1.2m) and $3m (£2.4m). "We are opening the new office in November," Mr Johnston told the Belfast Telegraph. "It was mainly a business decision to choose Belfast. "It's the same timezone with London and the UK clients, and was cost-effective. "I went to Jordanstown and you have graduates - there's a lot of talent in Belfast." The company currently has offices in San Francisco and London. Mr Johnston said the new Belfast base will focus on client support. The former Ormeau Baths has become a tech hub backed by people like FanDuel's Nigel Eccles and Aaron Taylor, managing partner of venture capital firm Frankly. "It will be training on software for clients, in Europe timezones, and really offering more proactive seminars and online training via Skype and Google Hangouts," Mr Johnston explained. On plans for the fresh capital, he said: "One area is overall expansion, as we have been growing pretty fast, and to meet demand for software we are adding similar types of people and software engineers." The firm is also adding new senior executives to the team, and hopes to grow to at least 75 employees by the end of the year. "We are launching a premium version of the product. At the moment it's free. We are going to give them (customers) the ability to pay the freelancers," he added. "Our software is like HR software, but catered for the freelance world. "Like ESPN, they have their employees at their headquarters, but they also have an army of 1,000 freelance photographers. "They won't be managed through that (HR software), but they will be managed by software like Lystable." Asked what it was like working with some of the technology world's biggest names, he said: "It's a bit weird. I left Jordanstown six years ago, but it feels like yesterday. "You get a very good broad base of skills, and I found my feet at Google. "It's been fun and it's huge for any company." Mr Johnston said he will be involved in the set-up of the Belfast office, and then will take on someone to run it. Valar Ventures' James Fitzgerald said: "Lystable is at the heart of a seismic shift in how people work. The concept of having a single, full-time employer is increasingly a thing of the past. "As the freelancer economy grows, companies of all sizes need an efficient and streamlined way to manage their growing army of freelancers."

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search Why You Shouldn’t Use (Most) Alternative Browsers Based on Google Chrome Google Chrome is based on Chromium, an open-source browser project. Anyone can take the Chromium source code and use it to build their own browser, renaming it and changing whatever they like. That’s why there are so many alternative browsers based on Google Chrome—but you don’t necessarily want to use most of them. Many web sites have recommended these browsers in the past—including us, in this very post. We’ve since rewritten this article to discuss the problems with some of these alternative browsers, and why we no longer recommend using them—with a few exceptions. The “Secure” Comodo Dragon Had Big Security Problems Comodo Dragon is a Chrome-based browser made by Comodo, a security company. It’s installed by default with Comodo Internet Security. You’d think a “secure” web browser made by a security software company would be…well, secure, but it’s had some big problems. Google’s Tavis Ormandy found that the browser shipped with a serious problem that destroyed the security of HTTPS encryption. As he put it: “Chromodo is described as ‘highest levels of speed, security and privacy’, but actually disables all web security.” Comodo responded by issuing a fix that didn’t actually fix the problem. Comodo did fix it eventually, but that doesn’t change the fact that such a glaring security problem shipped with the browser. Companies like Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, and Apple have never made such a big mistake in their products. Comodo doesn’t sound like a company we’d want to get our web browser from. SRWare Iron’s Privacy Claims Are Exaggerated, and It’s Slow to Update SRWare Iron promises to remove various privacy-infringing options from Google Chrome. But it isn’t as good as it sounds. Right off the bat, there’s something we don’t like: On March 17, 2017, the latest version of SRWare Iron was version 56.0.2950.1. The latest version of Chrome was version 57.0.2987.110, released on March 16. That means SRWare Iron was missing more than 36 security fixes that Chrome had for over a week. That’s because SRWare Iron’s developers have to do some work to release those security fixes whenever Google releases a new version of Chrome. It’s not instant, and these third-party projects may take a long time to issue updates if their developers are busy. RELATED ARTICLE How to Optimize Google Chrome for Maximum Privacy But here’s the real kicker: you aren’t really getting any extra privacy out of SRWare Iron. Most of what SRWare Iron does is possible through Chrome’s regular privacy settings. And if you enable those tweaks in Chrome, you’ll get the latest security updates without waiting for and trusting another company. Chromium Isn’t For Users (Except on Linux) Google doesn’t want you using the open-source Chromium browser. That’s why the Chromium project only offers “raw builds” of Chromium code that “may be tremendously buggy” for Windows. They also don’t include an auto-update feature, so you have to manually download new versions with security and bug fixes. These Chromium builds are really just development tools for checking whether issues are fixed in the latest Chromium code. Stay away. RELATED ARTICLE What’s the Difference Between Chromium and Chrome? Chromium’s main difference is that it’s entirely open-source, while Google Chrome includes a few closed-source pieces (like Flash). That’s why Chromium is often made available via the package repositories on Linux distributions. A Chromium browser obtained from your Linux package repositories should be safe and receive regular security updates from your Linux distribution. But Windows and Mac users should just install Chrome. The Chrome-Based Browsers Worth Using: Opera, Vivaldi, and Chrome Portable There are, of course, exceptions to every rule. Some browsers are solid alternatives to Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer. Opera, for example, has been around in one form or another for a long time, with the first version of Opera being released back in 1995. In 2013, the company abandoned its old, homegrown browser engine, Presto, and Opera is now based on Chromium. But Opera isn’t just a Chrome clone—it’s a unique browser with its own unique features, like a built-in VPN that can secure your web browsing. RELATED ARTICLE The Best Features of Vivaldi, a New Customizable Web Browser for Power Users Vivaldi is also based on Chromium, and was created by former Opera developers who disagree with Opera’s new direction. Released in 2016, Vivaldi attempts to restore various “power user” features the Opera project has removed. For example, Vivaldi allows you to make your tabs appear as vertical thumbnails, something that just isn’t possible in Chrome. The developers are working on adding a built-in email client, a feature no longer included on the latest versions of Opera. Both Opera and Vivaldi support Chrome extensions, as they’re based on the same underlying technology. If you’re looking for a new browser that still uses Chrome’s speedy rendering engine and supports the same browser extensions you use in Chrome, these browsers are interesting options you may want to try. RELATED ARTICLE What Is a “Portable” App, and Why Does It Matter? Lastly, you may also consider a portable version of Chrome or Chromium. The Chromium Portable project, for example, is a customized build of Chromium designed to run as a “portable application“. If you place its files on a USB drive or other removable media device, you can take it between computers, using it on any PC without installing it first. That said, Chromium Portable is based on the unstable “Dev” release channel of Google Chrome, which means it’s more unstable than the typical stable versions of Google Chrome. You probably aren’t looking for that. If you’d prefer a stable, portable version of Google Chrome, you’ll probably want to use the Google Chrome Portable package from PortableApps.com. Either way, both are decent, secure versions of Chrome. Why Lesser-Known Browsers Are Suspect There are other Chromium-based browsers out there. But we’re skeptical of them, and you should be too. Here’s the issue: Browsers are very important programs. You spend almost all of your internet-connected time in a browser, so it needs to be secure. Part of that means getting security updates very quickly when they’re released, and smaller Chromium-based browsers don’t always do that. Furthermore, you’re trusting a small company or group of developers to make changes to your browser, which can introduce problems—intentional or not. Comodo’s security problems and SRWare’s update delays are a few examples of the problems that can occur, even when a browser developer is acting in good faith. And if a browser developer isn’t acting in good faith, you’re in an even worse position: they could snoop on your web browsing and abuse its access to your computer. Even if you don’t trust Google, Google is a large company with a lot of eyes on it. Google won’t steal your credit card number. If Google does something bad or makes a big mistake in Chrome, everyone will hear about it. The same isn’t true for these Chromium alternatives. Many of the features promised in various third-party browsers can be achieved simply by tweaking Chrome’s settings or installing extensions from the Chrome Web Store. You’re better off using Google Chrome and installing a few browser extensions than switching to a Chrome-based alternative. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (20 REPLIES) Got Feedback?

The immediate financial impact of the controversy is likely to be limited, in part because a big chunk of YouTube revenue comes from smaller advertisers who lack the budget for TV campaigns and do not have easy alternatives. Some analysts also believe that departing advertisers, eager to reach YouTube's millennial audience, will quickly return. Share this story A picture illustration shows a YouTube logo reflected in a person's eye But with "brand safety" emerging as a major concern for marketers amid a surge in hate speech and other types of offensive content across the internet, the widespread assumption that major advertisers are ready to shift large chunks of their budgets from TV to digital now looks much more dubious. The timing may also favor television networks as they usually present their fall line-ups and woo big advertisers starting in May, agency executives said. YouTube, part of Alphabet Inc, has spent years courting big brands that spend hundreds of millions annually on air time. But over the past week, companies including Verizon Communications, AT&T and Johnson & Johnson have canceled their YouTube ad deals. “Video is actually a lot more fragile of an ecosystem than the Silicon Valley, software-eats-everything crowd may want to think," said Joel Espelien, a senior analyst at the Diffusion Group, which studies the future of television. "The point is all content isn’t actually the same, all advertising isn’t actually all the same. There is an element of taste. And when you ruin that, the whole thing does kind of start to fall apart.” Read also: Google ad crisis spreads Google offers little visibility into YouTube’s financial performance, but analysts view it as a key driver for the company’s growth as its traditional search advertising business matures. Analyst Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets estimates YouTube will bring in about $14 billion in revenue this year. Alphabet shares have fallen more than 3 percent since Monday, closing at $839.65 on Thursday. Whether the recent events are a mere blip on the radar for Google or a harbinger of bigger problems to come may depend on whether the company can quickly improve its technical tools to give advertisers more control over where their ads appear. YouTube has begun reviewing its advertising policies and will take steps to give advertisers more control, Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. Google also plans to hire more people for its review team and refine its artificial intelligence – a key step, since much of the ad-serving is handled by automation. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, acknowledged in a Fox News interview that ads appearing next to videos promoting hate speech or advocating violence had slipped through the digital cracks in Google's elaborate ad-serving systems. "We match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match," Schmidt said. "We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time and so I think we’re going to be OK.” But Google's public statements have done little to assuage advertisers’ fears, said David Cohen, president, North America, for media buying firm Magna Global. Privately, Google has gone into more detail about how it plans to combat the issue, including ratcheting up its algorithms to better categorize content and being more stringent about how content is labeled, Cohen said. But such additional controls would reduce the percentage of content that carries advertising and could disrupt the vibrant community of independent creators on YouTube, who drive traffic to the site and rely on revenue-sharing from advertising. YouTube faces a special imperative to keep creators happy as rivals such as Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc try to court talent for their own platforms, said Hank Green, a prominent YouTube creator who runs the VidCon conference. “YouTube has a decade-long head start, but obviously everyone wants a piece of the pie,” he said. Even before the most recent revelations about YouTube, control over online ad placement had become a hot button topic for advertisers. Social networks and news aggregators came under fire during and after the U.S. presidential election for spreading fake news reports, and advertisers have also sought to avoid having their brands appear beside content that they categorize as hate speech. “Between non-human traffic and fraud, fake news and hate speech, brands are more concerned than ever,” said Marc Goldberg, CEO of Trust Metrics, a New York-based company that addresses ad fraud.

It hopes this will prevent such content from crowding out factual, accurate and trustworthy information in the top search results. “We’re explicitly avoiding the term ‘fake news,’ because we think it is too vague,” said Paul Haahr, one of Google’s senior engineers who is involved with search quality said to Search Engine Land. “Demonstrably inaccurate information, however, we want to target.” New Role For Google’s Army Of ‘Quality Raters’ The effort revolves around Google’s quality raters, over 10,000 contractors that Google uses worldwide to evaluate search results. These raters are given actual searches to conduct, drawn from real searches that Google sees. They then rate pages that appear in the top results as to how good those seem as answers. Quality raters do not have the power to alter Google’s results directly. A rater marking a particular result as low quality will not cause that page to plunge in rankings. Instead, the data produced by quality raters is used to improve Google’s search algorithms generally. In time, that data might have an impact on low-quality pages that are spotted by raters, as well as on others that weren’t reviewed. Quality raters use a set of guidelines that are nearly 200 pages long, instructing them on how to assess website quality and whether the results they review meet the needs of those who might search for particular queries. The New ‘Upsetting-Offensive’ Content Flag Those guidelines have been updated with an entirely new section about “Upsetting-Offensive” content that covers a new flag that’s been added for raters to use. Until now, pages could not be flagged by raters with this designation. The guidelines say that upsetting or offensive content typically includes the following things from the guide: » Content that promotes hate or violence against a group of people based on criteria including (but not limited to) race or ethnicity, religion, gender, nationality or citizenship, disability, age, sexual orientation, or veteran status. » Content with racial slurs or extremely offensive terminology. » Graphic violence, including animal cruelty or child abuse. » Explicit how- to information about harmful activities (i.e., how tos on human trafficking or violent assault). » Other types of content which users in your locale would find extremely upsetting or offensive. Being Flagged Is Not An Immediate Demotion or A Ban What happens if content is flagged this way? Nothing immediate. The results that quality raters flag is used as “training data” for Google’s human coders who write search algorithms, as well as for its machine learning systems. Basically, content of this nature is used to help Google figure out how to automatically identify upsetting or offensive content in general. In other words, being flagged as “Upsetting-Offensive” by a quality rater does not actually mean that a page or site will be identified this way in Google’s actual search engine. Instead, it’s data that Google uses so that its search algorithms can automatically spot pages generally that should be flagged. If the algorithms themselves actually flag content, then that content is less likely to appear for searches where the intent is deemed to be about general learning. For example, someone searching for Holocaust information is less likely to run into Holocaust denial sites, if things go as Google intends. Being flagged as Upsetting-Offensive does not mean such content won’t appear at all in Google. In cases where Google determines there’s an explicit desire to reach such content, it will still be delivered. Those Explicitly Seeking Offensive Content Will Get Factual Information What about searches where people might already have made their minds up about particular situations? For example, if someone who already doubts the Holocaust happened does a search on that topic, should that be viewed as an explicit search for material that supports it, even if that material is deemed upsetting or offensive? The guidelines address this. It acknowledges that people may search for possibly upsetting or offensive topics. It takes the view that in all cases, the assumption should be toward returning trustworthy, factually accurate and credible information. Chipotle Back on Top as America’s Favorite Mexican Chain Chipotle is once again America’s favorite Mexican restaurant chain, according to a new study. It seems the burrito chain is finally making a comeback following an E. coli outbreak that sent its sales plunging for more than a year, according to the study by Market Force Information. Prior to the outbreak, Chipotle topped the list of Americans’ favorite Mexican chains. But it lost that spot to little-known Tex-Mex chain Taco Bueno last year. This year, Chipotle’s back on top. “After a rough couple of years that included an  E. coli outbreak and a hit to its stock price, Denver-based Chipotle once again leads the Mexican food category, a position it shared with Qdoba in the 2015 study before landing second behind lesser-known Taco Bueno in 2016,” Market Force said in a statement. “Moe’s Southwest Grill took second place this year, while El Pollo Loco ranked third, Qdoba fourth and Taco Cabana fifth.” The study also found that Chipotle’s efforts to improve its customer service has been paying off. The chain took first place for food quality, cleanliness, and curb appeal, and tied for first with Qdoba and Moe’s for service speed. Rockin’ Mic | Chuck Berry Helped Define the Genre? Chuck Berry, who died last week at age 90, helped define rock ‘n’ roll with indelible guitar licks, brash self-confidence and memorable songs about cars, girls and wild dance parties. While Elvis Presley was rock’s first pop star and teenage heartthrob, Mr. Berry was its master theorist and conceptual genius, the songwriter who understood what the kids wanted before they knew themselves. With songs like “Johnny B. Goode” and “Roll Over Beethoven,” he gave his listeners much more than they bargained for when they dropped their coins in the jukebox! By the 1980s, Mr. Berry was recognized as a rock pioneer. He never won a Grammy Award in his prime, but the Recording Academy gave him a lifetime achievement award in 1984. And, he was in the first group of musicians inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986. For his indelible mark as a music icon, Berry takes a Rockin’ Mic – and somewhere just beyond the pearly gates, Beethoven is indeed rolling over. Each week, The Spin Cycle will bestow a Golden Mic Award to the person, group or company in the court of public opinion that best exemplifies the tenets of solid PR, marketing and advertising – and those who don’t. Stay tuned – and step-up to the mic!

Valentina Palladino - Mar 24, 2017 2:05 pm UTC Welcome to your new Hangout. reader comments 147 Share this story Google continues to shake up its messaging tools with the upcoming removal of a popular feature from Hangouts. According to an e-mail sent to GSuite administrators and subsequently posted to Reddit, Google will remove the SMS feature from Hangouts on May 22. Anyone using Hangouts as both a Google messaging app and their primary text messaging app won't be able to send SMS texts after that date. Further ReadingGoogle is turning Hangouts into a Slack competitor Hangouts users will be notified of this change via an in-app message starting March 27. You'll be prompted to select a new default messaging app from your list of downloaded apps. If you don't have anything other than Hangouts, you'll be directed to the Google Play Store to download another messaging app. All of your existing SMS messages will not be affected, and they will be available in your new default messaging app. Google Voice users will also be affected, but not as much as Hangouts-only users. The rule only applies to messages sent and received with your carrier phone number—all SMS messages sent with your Google Voice number will remain unaffected. "For SMS users using Google Voice on Hangouts on Android Google Voice users who also send carrier SMS messages will need to choose another default messaging app. Their Google Voice messages will be unaffected and will still be available in Google Hangouts," the e-mail states. "For Google Voice users on Hangouts on Android Google Voice users who do not use carrier SMS, text messaging will not be affected and no notification will be shown." This change comes just weeks after Google revealed its new plans to turn Hangouts into a better workplace communications tool that apes Slack. The company is likely trying to remove any associations Hangouts has with traditional SMS messaging so it can position Hangouts as more of a collaboration, sharing, and productivity app. But Google has a plethora of chat apps, so while Hangouts users may be annoyed at being forced out of their primary SMS app, they have other options. Arguably the best of those options would be Android Messages, Google's renamed Messages app and the default RCS app for Android users, but there's also the text-based app Allo and the mobile-only video chat app Duo as well.

Google’s copyright lawyer Katherine Oyama endorsed this approach on behalf of Google before the U.S. Congress in 2011 (“We would publicly support legislation like what I described, the follow the money approach…”). Several UK banks and other advertisers are now doing just that according to the London Times (“Banks pull Google ads in row over hate videos“): Three of Britain’s biggest banks have pulled advertising from Google after their marketing appeared alongside extremist YouTube videos. HSBC, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland acted over fears that chunks of their advertising budgets have in­advertently ended up in the pockets of banned hate preachers and anti-semites. The lenders join a growing list of big advertisers who have withdrawn marketing from the search engine and its YouTube video platform. These include McDonald’s, L’Oréal, Audi and the BBC. How might these sites have gotten a share of revenue from ads served against their videos?  There’s only one way I know of that could happen, and it starts with having a Google Adsense account approved by Google. In order to get an approved Adsense account, the party must apply for it, give out their payment information (see Step 2 “How Will I Be Paid”) and Google approves the account for monetization purposes.  The applicant gets paid because Google approved them for payment. A YouTube channel partner gets paid for advertising on their YouTube videos through an existing Adsense account, so this is a second layer of approval to associate the YouTube partner channel with the YouTube partner’s Adsense account: So if we follow the money as Google has suggested many, many times, it is clear that it is not possible to have a monetized YouTube channel without at least two layers of approval by Google.  Google also knows who to pay, which bank account to pay, and presumably the taxpayer name and tax ID number for the account.  And of course I would assume that Google would be sending an IRS Form 1099 to the channel partner or otherwise complying with taxing authorities. Following the money in this case would be very simple, particularly if Google is cooperating. The money isn’t the only issue, however.  YouTube partner accounts depicting Nazi symbolism transmitted in Germany, Austria, Switzerland or any other country with prohibitions on the dissemination of Nazi symbolism may present a different problem.  Those accounts (and presumably Google itself) will be subject to the Strafgesetzbuch section 86a criminal law in Germany and analog criminal statutes in Austria and Switzerland which ban Nazi symbols like this: And also like this: In fact, if you do YouTube searches for bands on the ADL’s “Bigots Who Rock” list, you’ll find other examples. It is also worth noting that YouTube monetizes search (YouTube is the second largest search engine online) even if the videos themselves are not monetized, and that YouTube almost certainly keeps all the money such as the ad for Osmo that monetizes a search for extremist videos.   The problem that YouTube is experiencing now that has resulted in hundreds of major advertisers pulling out is not that different that the problems that Google had with music and movie piracy as described in the Megavideo indictment: Google had given Megaupload (or an associate of Megaupload) an Adsense account  Although it appears from the indictment that at least one Adsense account was terminated, Megaupload had been operating for a while before the account was terminated.  It does not appear that Google notified advertisers, recovered improper payments to Megaupload or refunded even Google’s own share of revenue to advertisers. This is important to remember–following the money inevitably leads back to Google itself for advertisers to demand at least the share of advertisers’ money that Google kept for its own account not to mention the sums paid to the YouTube or Adsense partner.  In fact, there’s an argument to be made that the YouTube or Adsense partner, however distasteful, may have done nothing wrong as between that partner and Google.  It is Google that made the promise to the advertiser of where their ads would appear, not the channel partner. The solution for this is probably best summarized by Professor Ben Edelman’s bill of rights for advertisers.  The solution is ultimately going to turn on both enforcement of Google’s terms of use as well as its monetization policy.  It should be obvious now that Google’s current practices on YouTube simply will not wash–the plan should be to stop the videos from being uploaded if they violate the terms of use, not relying on advertisers or the police to catch them after the fact. This will take time to give effect of course.  The good news is that Google has a host of forensic information that will be of good use to the police in some cases, but inevitably will make refunding advertising payments to Google’s clients ever so much easier. All they have to do is follow the money.

In early 2016, Google unveiled tech incubator Jigsaw, with the intention of “substantially reducing” online hate and harassment. But the plan backfired when trolls responded with the “Operation Google” campaign, which replaces racial slurs with names of technology brands and products. “Google,” for example, refers to black people, while fellow search engines “Yahoo” and “Bing” allude to Mexicans and Asians, and Jewish folks are called “Skypes.” The idea was to force Google to censor its own websites by making the common word synonymous with bigotry. Now, analysts at New York’s University of Rochester are fighting back with an AI of their own. The team collected about a quarter of a million unique English tweets from between Sept. 23—the first reported incident of hate-code words—and Oct. 18—a week after the second US presidential election debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. “There were some interesting observations that we noted,” they wrote in a paper that will be presented in May at Montreal’s International Conference on Web and Social Media. The top 10 terms among those tweets labeled as hateful include hashtags #MAGA (Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again”), #MAWA (the more racist “Make America White Again”), and #ALTRIGHT. Researchers also found words like “white,” “war,” “hate,” and “destroy.” Of course, none of that should surprise anyone who has not been living in a cave without Internet access for the past two years. What may (and definitely should) appall people, though, is the occurrence of the term “gas,” used almost exclusively within hateful tweets about Jews. “It is particularly this unchecked abject display of hatred and calls for violence that we hoped to capture through our system,” the scientists said. With their project a success—”apart from the system’s ability to predict for a given tweet whether it is hateful or not, the system also generates a list of users who frequently post such content”—the team intends to continue working to curb online harassment.

 Google's security efforts are paying off for Android BI Intelligence Mar. 24, 2017, 9:25 AM 818 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Google Maps finds a way monetize Verizon joins the smartwatch market Nearly 200,000 apps could be incompatible with iOS 11 This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Efforts to improve security in Google Play paid off in 2016, according to Google's latest Android Security Year in Review report. The share of Android devices that install apps only from Google Play that had Potentially Harmful Apps (PHAs) stood at just 0.05% in 2016. That’s down significantly from 0.15% in 2014 and 2015. PHAs are defined as apps that may harm a device, the user of a device, or employ user data in an unintended manner. While Android has traditionally had more security issues than iOS, because Google’s open ecosystem naturally presents more opportunities for malicious actors, security-oriented updates over the past year appear to have reduced the frequency of PHAs in the app store and as a share of all installs. The share of questionable apps in the Google Play store is small. PHAs accounted for 0.16% of all apps published to Google Play in 2016. The Google Play store has over 1 million applications. Fewer PHAs in the app store is driving the rate of PHA installations of all app installs to record lows. PHAs accounted for 0.06% of all Google Play installs in 2016, down from .28% in 2015. This decline is largely due to Google effectively tackling the worst offenders. Trojan apps, or those that appear benign but deliver concealed malware once downloaded, accounted for the majority of PHA installs in 2016 but saw a significant decrease from 2015. Trojan PHAs accounted for 0.016% of all Google Play app installs in 2016, down from 0.045% in 2015. Hostile Downloaders, the second most common PHA, also saw a significant decrease to 0.004% of all installs in 2016, down from 0.011% in 2015. The existence of PHAs on Android devices that access other Android app stores see higher rates of PHAs installed on devices. The share of PHA installs from sources outside of Google Play was 4.92% in 2016, down significantly from 9.4% in 2015 but still much higher than observed in Google Play installs. Continued security efforts will be important for Google moving forward. While perceived security of a mobile OS is important now, it will become substantially more important in the near to medium term as consumers use their mobile devices to access more sensitive information, such as health data and banking and payments information. Consumers who wish to use their devices to access secure data, but do not perceive their mobile platform as secure, will seek more secure mobile environments. App developers long considered the "pay once and play" model — in which users pay up front an app and aren't prompted to make in-app purchases — the best way to generate revenue. But as more "free-to-download" apps entered the market, users increasingly opted for these experiences. These apps offer microtransactions for in-app goods and services, and in-app ads. As the app ecosystem expands further, it will become increasingly challenging for developers to compete in a crowded market. Overall, global gross app revenue will double to reach $102 billion by 2020, according to recent projections by App Annie. As a result, app monetization strategies need to shift at least as quickly as consumer trends and preferences in order for developers to capture a piece of this growing market. Laurie Beaver, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on app monetization that explores the top app monetization strategies under user- and advertising-paid approaches, and the growing combination of both. We will also look at emerging trends that could help developers navigate the fiercely competitive app ecosystem, and address the potential barriers that developers will have to overcome to reap the benefits of the multi-billion dollar market. Here are some of the key takeaways:  The app ecosystem is expanding quickly, and it's becoming increasingly challenging for app developers to compete in a crowded market.  To capture a piece of the growing market, app developers must adapt their strategies at least as quickly as consumer trends and preferences change.  Developers can choose a user-paid or an advertising-paid approach to monetizing their apps. Different monetization strategies work best with different apps. There are a number of widespread challenges that developers must contend with both before and after they enter the app market.   In full, the report: Provides key factors driving the expected growth of global app revenue Evaluates the top app monetization strategies Looks at emerging trends to help developers navigate the app ecosystem Explains the challenges that developers face to compete in the app market And much more Interested in getting the full report?

While the mockery of the Mail may have been strong, even Downing Street said this morning that social media companies must do more on the issue: Theresa May joins in the pummelling of Google et al on hate material.

According to Metro, he said: “This is something that the internet companies and social media companies need to think about. “They need to do more to take that stuff off their media, the incitements, the information about how to become a terrorist, the radicalising sermons and messages. That needs to come down.” The Mail has reported Google has now removed the links its journalists found. Reporters also found links on Twitter, one of which was removed when they contacted the social media company. It was announced last year that Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft would be joining forces to curb the dissemination of terrorist content on their platforms. The four firms have committed to using a shared database of digital fingerprints to swiftly find and remove extremist content. If one company removes a piece of content, the others will be able to use the same fingerprint, known as a hash, to quickly follow suit.

Google Is Reportedly Killing Hangouts Text Messaging Feature GO Text messaging may no longer be a feature in Hangouts Mar 24, 2017 13:46 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google has been making some major changes to its messaging applications, constantly updating Allo with new features, transforming Android Messages and shifting Hangouts towards exclusive business use. Google might remove the text messaging feature from its Android app, Hangouts, according to an email sent to its G Suite administrators. The email was posted on Reddit and reveals that Google plans to cut the option from the app on May 22 and request users to find another default messaging service. Hangouts users might receive a message starting March 27, informing them that the SMS feature will be removed and that they should use another chat app instead. The app will also ask them to select other messaging apps as default, and if they refuse, they will be redirected to the Google Play Store to find a new alternative. SMS through user Google Voice numbers can still be sent The situation is a bit more complicated for Google Voice users, as they will no longer have the option to send carrier text messages via Hangouts from May 22. However, those who send SMS through their Google Voice numbers will be able to continue as before. Through this move, Google aims to attract more users to Allo, its newest messaging app, especially since the tech giant recently added a number of new features, including the option to share files. Moreover, Allo comes with Google Assistant integration, the virtual AI which started rolling out to Android-running smartphones, but not to tablets. Google is also continuing the process of positioning Hangouts as a messaging service for the workplace. To highlight this, Google recently announced a video service that facilitates the meeting between team members in Hangouts and an intelligent communications tool with direct messaging for co-workers who use this app. As for the default messaging app on Google mobile OS, Android Messages will be handling consumer SMS service and comes with RCS integration for sending in-call multimedia content. #Google#Hangouts#Text messaging#Allo#Duo subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Updates Duo with Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Gboard for Android Updated with New Emojis, GIF Suggestions, Live Translations Google Announces New Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat Services Google Assistant Can Now Read and Interact with Text Messages Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Samsung Store in Singapore Catches Fire Ahead of Galaxy S8 Unveil All 2017 iPhones to Support Wireless Charging, Apple Watch to Feature LTE How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Creators Update RTM Right Now Survey: 93% of Millennials Aren't Quitting Uber Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Latest Black Lab Linux Weekly Build Optimizes Swap File Management for SSD Windows 10, the Only Way to Go: 8 in 10 Companies to Install the OS, Study Shows    Google Hangouts logo New Android APKs Growtopia APK: Updated March 28th, 11:49 GMT feedly APK: Updated March 28th, 11:46 GMT Night Owl APK: Updated March 28th, 11:44 GMT NewsTab APK: Updated March 28th, 11:41 GMT Star Trek Timelines APK: Updated March 28th, 11:36 GMT Khan Academy APK: Updated March 28th, 11:32 GMT N.O.V.A.

March 24, 2017 WSP The prospect that artificial intelligence (AI) might one day surpass human intelligence is one that many people, including a number of notable personalities, are terrified of. And it’s not hard to see where that fear is coming from. As it is, deep learning machines have already shown a number of ways where they outperform humans. So far, they can play video games, recognize faces, and even do stock market trading. There’s one area, though, where humans are still superior, and that’s the speed at which we learn. Right now, humans learn at a rate that’s 10 times faster than that of a deep learning machine. And it is this ‘superiority’ that has kept that ‘AI taking over humans’ apocalyptic view in the background. Thanks (or no thanks?) to Google, however, this status quo is about to change. According to Alexander Pritzel of Google’s DeepMind subsidiary in London, they have built a deep-learning machine that can learn as quickly as a human. Aside from that, this AI can supposedly understand and act on new experiences faster, which will allow it to reach human-level learning speeds sooner rather than later. Deep learning works by using layers of neural networks to identify patterns and trends in data. When one layer detects a pattern, it sends this information to the next pattern, which then sends it to the next pattern. This passing on of data continues until all layers are aware of the information. The way the systems learn can be done differently by modifying or adjusting internal factors such as the strength of connection between layers. Changes have to be introduced slowly, however, because a drastic change in one layer can have an equally drastic effect on all succeeding layers. This is basically what’s taking deep neural networks a longer time to learn and be trained. Pritzel claims they’ve found a workaround to address this issue through what they refer to as ‘neural episodic control‘. As the team told MIT Technology Review, using the said technique has resulted in ‘dramatic improvements  on the speed of learning for a wide range of environments’ as their agent is able to ‘rapidly latch onto highly successful strategies as soon as they are experienced, instead of waiting for many steps of optimisation.’ DeepMind’s approach tries to replicate how learning happens in humans and animals. First, it copies what happens in the prefrontal cortex of the brain — identifying a familiar situation and behaving based on what it already knows about this. In case of an unfamiliar situation, it copies what happens in the hippocampus instead, a kind of ‘trial and error’ approach where behavior that results in a successful outcome is repeated and behavior that doesn’t is avoided in the future. What accelerates the learning process is its ‘remembering everything’ instead of ‘selective remembering’. “Our architecture does not try to learn when to write to memory, as this can be slow to learn and take a significant amount of time. Instead, we elect to write all experiences to the memory, and allow it to grow very large compared to existing memory architectures,” the team explained. An AI that has the potential to be taught like a human is like a double-edged sword. On one end, it reinforces the threat that AI poses on the superiority that it might gain over the human race. On the other end, it also brings with it a promise of better things to come as it opens up a slew of new and exciting possibilities which will hopefully lead to the development of new technologies that can make our lives better. Whichever the case will be, we’ll just have to wait and see. GOOGL Previous article Next article Related Articles News Morning Buzz: Twitter (TWTR), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet Inc.

Recently, the search giant emailed all the members of its G Suite team to inform them about ending SMS support in Hangouts starting May 22. Mizter_x94 / Pixabay How the change affects Hangouts users In its email posted on Reddit, the search giant says that it announced multiple improvements to Hangouts’ most popular features last year, like better group chat messaging and the new video meetings experience. “As part of that ongoing effort, we will be removing carrier SMS text messaging from Hangouts on Android after May 22, 2017,” the email reads. Users who have enabled Hangouts as their default SMS app will be notified of the change starting March 27. People using Hangouts SMS will be directed to set another chat app as the default SMS application. Google will redirect users who do not have any SMS app pre-installed to download one from the Play Store. It is a little different for people using Google Voice. These users won’t be able to send carrier SMS messages through Hangouts starting May 22, but they will be allowed to send SMS through their Google Voice numbers, just like before. If you have not enabled Hangouts as the default SMS messenger app on your device and you do not use Google Voice, you will not be affected and will receive no notification about the change. Google aiming at corporate customers Hangouts for Android was released in May 2013, and it has not changed much since then. For some users, Hangouts is irreplaceable because it is easy to use, it syncs all your messages and it goes wherever you go, like you can sync it with your Gmail or use it on the web through hangouts.google.com. These users will be somewhat disappointed, as now they will need one more app for SMS. This move seems to be a part of Google’s ongoing efforts to expand its presence in the enterprise segment. Recently, the search giant released Hangouts Meet for corporate video conferencing. It is already getting enough competition from the likes of Slack, Microsoft’s Teams and Skype in the enterprise segment. Google is already represented by a variety of chat apps like the text-based chat app Allo, the mobile-only video-centric Duo and Android Messages. Android Messages, which was announced only recently, is designed to manage Google’s consumer SMS service. Now you can download it to make it your default SMS app. Tags: Google Hangouts Slack SMS Load Comments Send us your tips at tips(at)valuewalk.com Latest News From ValueWalk Einhorn: 2 GM Stock Classes Would Better Serve Investors Timing Is Everything… Except When Investing For The Long-Term In Defense Of Fairness Opinions – An Empirical Review Of Ten Years Of Data The Fate Of The Federal Reserve Is Now Up For Grabs Join Us On Facebook Copyright © 2016 ValueWalk - Privacy Policy Follow Us: Developed by ValueWalk Team Sponsored Content - Resource Center

It is now time for YouTube's "Extremist Hate-Speech Hour", occasionally brought to you in association with, until recently, some of the biggest brands in the world, including none other than AT&T and Verizon, among others. Not any more of course, because the two telcos are among a growing number of prominent companies that pulled their ad spend from YouTube and Google this week, after their adverts appeared alongside extremist material.

Not any more of course, because the two telcos are among a growing number of prominent companies that pulled their ad spend from YouTube and Google this week, after their adverts appeared alongside extremist material. The wave of withdrawals started to gather pace last week as several European advertisers, including Sky, Vodafone, and O2 UK, pulled their ads. This week, the backlash reached the U.S., prompting Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, to invoke parent company Alphabet's recently-revised mantra, and do the right thing, which in this case meant apologising, and pledging to be better in future. In a conciliatory blog post, Schindler recognised YouTube's importance for upholding free speech, but also acknowledged that major advertisers don't want their logos to appear next to a stream of invective spewing from the mouth of some deluded scumbag. Google is supposed to be able to automatically filter out dodgy content when placing adverts, which is no easy task when 400 videos per minute are uploaded to YouTube, but it seems there is plenty of room for improvement. "Recently, we had a number of cases where brands' ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologise," Schindler wrote. "We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us." While all the negative publicity this week has been directed at Google, according to telecoms analyst and Radio Free Mobile founder Richard Windsor, another ad-funded Internet giant has greater cause for concern. Facebook faces "a much more serious problem," he claimed. Google's advances in artificial intelligence means it is well equipped to trawl through a vast amount of content and filter out extreme material, but the same cannot be said for Facebook, he said. Facebook is already working on tools to flag up potentially fake news, and has added warnings to graphic content, but Windsor claims it is still "far behind its global peers when it comes to AI. "This means that while it is sitting on the world's second-largest treasure trove of data, it is unable to understand what most of it is and is therefore unable to weed out content that is objectionable to its customers." Potentially alienating advertisers represents a much more serious issue for Facebook than Google, Windsor said. He estimates that YouTube and display advertising accounts for around 12% of Google's gross revenues. At Facebook, advertising accounts for a much larger chunk of turnover. If and when a backlash against ads appearing alongside extreme content hits Facebook, "it will hit much harder and it is likely to last longer," Windsor warned. It is also worth considering that because Google is the first to face this kind of public crisis, it can reasonably be expected to be the first to address it and move on. Schindler said Google has pledged to crack down on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. "This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. This change will enable us to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites," he said. "We'll be hiring significant numbers of people and developing new tools powered by our latest advancements in AI and machine learning to increase our capacity to review questionable content for advertising," he continued. "In cases where advertisers find their ads were served where they shouldn't have been, we plan to offer a new escalation path to make it easier for them to raise issues. In addition, we'll soon be able to resolve these cases in less than a few hours." One major industry player that has also been busy in the advertising world this week is Altice. The multinational cable group on Tuesday struck a deal to acquire online video ad specialist Teads, in a deal valuing the company at €285 million. Teads is a marketplace that sits between brands and publishers, placing the former's adverts alongside the latter's content. It claims to reach an audience of 1.2 billion. It is not a YouTube; it does not have to deal directly with nutters uploading abhorrent material to the Internet. In a statement, Altice CEO Michel Combes said the deal "will enable us to offer a truly unique value proposition to brands and agencies on the one hand, and the media industry, programmers and distributors on the other." Based on Google's experience this week, Altice might just also be having a quick glance through the list of 8,000 'specialist publishers' on Teads' books, just to be on the safe side...

Raymond Ronamai   March 24, 2017 18:58 IST Every product begins it journey as a crazy idea in someone's head. No wonder sci-fi novels and movies serve as a wellspring for many innovative products. So much so the weird technology seen in movies sometimes inspire scientists to look at the possibility of coming up with real world counterparts. The technology giants enlist thought leaders and give them a free reign to ideate futuristic devices. Google, Samsung, Sony and Motorola have a few crazy devices, that can shape the future of technology, in the works– at least that's what their patent filings with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) say. Also read: Is it a phone? Is it a gun? US cops will have a hard time with this weapon Here are five weirdest patent filings that can revolutionise the future of technology: Smartphone Eye Implant: Google filed a patent called "Intra-ocular device" in 2014 in the name of Andrew Jason Conrad, the head of Life Sciences at Google and USPTO published it in 2016.  "An intra-ocular device includes an electronic lens that can be controlled to control the overall optical power of the device. The device can be installed within a flexible polymeric material shaped to conform to the inside surface of a lens capsule of an eye," reads the patent. If this technology comes true, Google glass will turn obsolete. Google filed a patent called "Intra-ocular device" in 2014USPTO Tattoo microphone (Electronic Skin Tattoo): Motorola Mobility Inc. filed a patent called "Coupling an Electronic Skin Tattoo to a Mobile Communication Device," which in simple term means tattooing a smartphone microphone onto the throat to provide auxiliary voice input to a mobile communication device. Filed in 2012 and published by USPTO in 2013, the patent is about tattooing a microphone with a transceiver and power supply onto the throat to enable wireless communication. If implemented, this technology will solve the issue of background noise while talking on phone once and for all. Motorola Mobility Inc. has filed a patent called "Coupling an Electronic Skin Tattoo to a Mobile Communication Device"USPTO Cars with adhesive front: USPTO published Google's patent called "Adhesive vehicle front end for mitigation of secondary pedestrian impact" in 2016, two years after it was filed.  "Ideally, the adhesive coating on the front portion of the vehicle may be activated on contact and will be able to adhere to the pedestrian nearly instantaneously. Both the vehicle and pedestrian may come to a more gradual stop than if the pedestrian bounces off the vehicle," read the patent description. USPTO published Google's patent called "Adhesive vehicle front end for mitigation of secondary pedestrian impact" in 2016USPTO Wearable Robot Legs: Samsung filed a patent titled "Wearable robot for assisting muscular strength of lower extremity" in 2009 and USPTO has published it recently. It is a human wearable robot technology that power you up.   Such wearable robots have been developed to assist the muscular strength of degenerative muscular disease patients or the elderly, but hasn't been used for work sites. A little assistance from an external source like a robot could make a normal person have the strength of a superhuman. Samsung filed a patent titled "Wearable robot for assisting muscular strength of lower extremity" in 2009USPTO SmartWig: Patented in 2013 by Japanese technology giant Sony, the patent called "Wearable computing device" aka SmartWig will have at least a sensor to provide input data, the control unit to process the data and the communication interface to communicate with the second computing device. When linked to other devices like smartphone, smartwatches etc, the SmartWig is supposed to alert the users with vibration or other signals when they get a phone call or message. It may even indicate directions and come with in-built audio functions.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose as much as 96 points just before 1 p.m., but doubts about the bill cast a shadow over the market as hardline conservatives said they didn’t support it. Health care stocks turned lower. Elsewhere, a growing boycott of YouTube advertising hurt Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Smaller companies did better than the rest of the market and more stocks rose than fell, a sign investors are still confident in the U.S. economy. Near the close of trading, House Republican leadership postponed a vote on the American Health Care Act because of a lack of support. Conservatives and more moderate Republicans had opposing concerns about the bill, which is widely disliked by House Democrats. Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said investors are worried about how the Republican-controlled Congress and White House will come together on issues including tax reform, a debt ceiling increase, and a boost in infrastructure spending. “If the Republicans are having such a difficult time making changes to something they universally agree upon, how on earth are they going to agree on the more complicated tax cut that is coming through later in the year?” Cox asked. Still, the losses were small, suggesting investors think some of those proposals will be delayed rather than abandoned. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell 2.49 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,345.96. The Dow lost 4.72 points to 20,656.58. The Nasdaq composite slid 3.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,817.69. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies, gained 7.83 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,353.43. Bond prices edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which has skidded over the last few days, rose to 2.42 percent from 2.40 percent. That modest increase gave banks and other financial companies a lift. The S&P 500 banking index had plunged 5 percent over the previous four days as bond yields and interest rates decreased. Banks turned higher on Thursday. SunTrust Banks added 67 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $54.85 and Huntington Bancshares rose 24 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $13.02. Alphabet fell as a YouTube advertising boycott spread. Companies including Johnson & Johnson, AT&T and Verizon have suspended their YouTube ad campaigns in the last week because their ads were appearing alongside offensive videos, including some that promoted terrorism. The ads are placed automatically and Google has said it will do more to block offensive videos. YouTube is one of the fastest-growing parts of Google’s ad system. Alphabet lost $10.15, or 1.2 percent, to $839.65. Technology companies lagged the rest of the market. Alphabet is the second-most valuable company on the S&P 500 after Apple. Companies that run Medicaid programs, like Centene and Molina Healthcare, stumbled in afternoon trading and health insurance companies like UnitedHealth and Humana took small losses. Drug companies also fell. Hospital operators traded higher, as did medical device makers. Cox, of Harris Financial, said stocks probably won’t fall much further if the bill ultimately fails because investors will focus on other items on Trump’s agenda. “The market doesn’t care a bit about the health care legislation,” he said. PVH, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, jumped after its fourth-quarter profit and sales topped analyst estimates. It said sales for the Hilfiger brand grew in the latest quarter and its business is doing well in spite of high discounts in the U.S. The stock gained $7.70, or 8.5 percent, to $98.55. Discount retailer Five Below also climbed after it surpassed Wall Street projections in its fourth quarter. The stock rose $4.12, or 10.8 percent, to $42.25. Retailers have struggled in recent months, but consumer-focused companies did better than the broader market on Thursday. Nike, which plunged 7 percent a day earlier, recovered $1.45, or 2.7 percent, to $55.37. U.S. crude oil lost 34 cents to $47.70 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 8 cents to $50.56 a barrel in London. That pulled energy companies lower. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 1 cent to $1.59 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to$1.49 a gallon. Natural gas rose 4 cents to $3.05 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $2.50 to $1,247.20 an ounce, which ended a small five-day streak of gains. Silver rose 2 cents to $17.59 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.64 a pound. The dollar inched up to 111.07 yen from 110.92 yen. The euro slid to $1.0786 from $1.0798. Germany’s DAX jumped 1.1 percent and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.8 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 index added 0.2 percent. In Japan the Nikkei 225 gained 0.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was flat and the South Korean Kospi gained 0.2 percent. ——— AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay     Tags: percent, companies, cents, which, investors, market, Other stories from today: Stock rally sputters after vote on health bill delayed 17K AT&T workers will come back on the job Thursday WikiLeaks: CIA hacked Apple devices in ways users can’t fix     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   Do you think on-demand ride companies like Uber and Lyft are helping with the area's traffic congestion?

The tool had actually existed within the app under the name Google Latitude years ago and is making a comeback after a sorely missed absence. To get started, you’ll have to open the side menu or tap on the blue dot which represents your location. There should be a new ‘Share location’ option that lets you choose how long you want to broadcast your position and who with. You can even send a link to people via third-party apps. Once you begin sharing your up-to-the-minute location, your Google Maps screen will have an icon above the compass to indicate that you are actively sharing your spot. Your contact will see you in the form of a moving image bubble on their device. Also Read: Google may have a larger third phone codenamed taimen in the works You can kickstart real-time sharing within the navigation window as well, so you won’t have to waste time switching back and forth. All you have to do is select the ‘More’ button which resides at the bottom of the navigation screen and tap on ‘Share trip progress.’ The person on the other end will automatically see your expected arrival time and keep track of you till you make it to your destination. The sharing will cease the moment you arrive. The feature is cross-platform, meaning the friends you share your location with can view it on Android, iPhone, desktop, and mobile web. Real-time location sharing is set to roll out to both iOS and Android users all across the world over the course of the week. You can download Google Maps via the App Store and Play Store.

Google ads boycott unlikely in Australia google 140807 AFR photo Tamara Voninski Google office in Sydney cbd. generic google SPECIALX 68861 *afr first use only* Photo: Tamara Voninski Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit A UK-led boycott of Google's programmatic advertising is unlikely to spread to Australia, according to local media buyers. So far several prominent UK advertisers including the British Government, Toyota and The Guardian, have pulled their advertising spend over concerns ads were appearing next to extremist or inappropriate content. The campaign is being led by the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers [ISBA], which has called on Google to change its advertising policy. " As a specific example, ISBA urges Google to review the practice of placing advertising immediately against newly-uploaded YouTube content, before it has been classified. Google should ensure that content is quarantined until properly categorised," the group said recently. The statement came following reports by the News Corp-owned Times of London that ads were appearing next to extremist videos. UK media buying agency Havas this week pulled all its clients from Google. In a statement, a Google spokesperson says the company is working to rectify the issue. "We don't comment on individual customers but as announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear. We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers' brands." Some major US advertisers, including AT&T and Johnson & Johnson have also pulled advertising from Google. The controversy over ad placement, now in its second week, is expanding at a pace Google has struggled to match in its response. Its parent company Alphabet's market value has dropped by about $US24 billion ($31 billion) this week. However, the boycott has not yet spread to Australia, according to chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, Vijay Solanki. If marketers, agencies and publishers work together it is possible to keep brands safe online, he said. "If you use the filtering processes and you do your planning rigorously you can create quite strong levels of brand safety," he told Fairfax Media. Head of Havas in Australia, Mike Wilson, said the boycott in the UK was a temporary hold related to specific local concerns, and may not happen in Australia. "We are conducting our own internal audit around brand safety," he told Fairfax Media. "[We have] no local plans to suspend partnerships with anybody until we have conducted our audit." Meanwhile chief executive of Think TV, Kim Portrate, would not comment directly on brands pulling their advertising from Google. Think TV was set up by television networks to encourage advertisers to increase their spend on television. "So far in 2017 we have seen a groundswell; some very big brands are insisting they get what they pay for when it comes to media," Ms Portrate said. The story Google ads boycott unlikely in Australia first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

YouTube, part of Alphabet Inc, has spent years courting big brands that spend hundreds of millions annually on air time. Analyst Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets estimates YouTube will bring in about $14 billion in revenue this year. YouTube has begun reviewing its advertising policies and will take steps to give advertisers more control. Corporate News YouTube's bid to grab TV dollars threatened by advertiser revolt Friday, March 24, 2017 15:04 By REUTERS Youtube logo. FILE PHOTO | NMG  Corporate NewsAdvertiser revolt threatens Youtube's strategy The decision by a handful of high-profile consumer brands to pull advertising from Google’s YouTube over offensive content could threaten the site’s long-term strategy of stealing ad dollars from television, analysts and ad industry professionals said Thursday. The immediate financial impact of the controversy is likely to be limited, in part because a big chunk of YouTube revenue comes from smaller advertisers who lack the budget for TV campaigns and do not have easy alternatives. Some analysts also believe that departing advertisers, eager to reach YouTube's millennial audience, will quickly return. But with "brand safety" emerging as a major concern for marketers amid a surge in hate speech and other types of offensive content across the internet, the widespread assumption that major advertisers are ready to shift large chunks of their budgets from TV to digital now looks much more dubious. The timing may also favour television networks as they usually present their fall line-ups and woo big advertisers starting in May, agency executives said. Big brands YouTube, part of Alphabet Inc , has spent years courting big brands that spend hundreds of millions annually on air time.

"The point is all content isn’t actually the same, all advertising isn’t actually all the same. There is an element of taste. And when you ruin that, the whole thing does kind of start to fall apart.” Google offers little visibility into YouTube’s financial performance, but analysts view it as a key driver for the company’s growth as its traditional search advertising business matures. Analyst Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets estimates YouTube will bring in about $14 billion in revenue this year. Alphabet shares have fallen more than 3 per cent since Monday, closing at $839.65 on Thursday. Mere blip? Whether the recent events are a mere blip on the radar for Google or a harbinger of bigger problems to come may depend on whether the company can quickly improve its technical tools to give advertisers more control over where their ads appear. YouTube has begun reviewing its advertising policies and will take steps to give advertisers more control, Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. Google also plans to hire more people for its review team and refine its artificial intelligence – a key step, since much of the ad-serving is handled by automation. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, acknowledged in a Fox News interview that ads appearing next to videos promoting hate speech or advocating violence had slipped through the digital cracks in Google's elaborate ad-serving systems. "We match ads and the content, but because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match," Schmidt said. "We’ve had to tighten our policies and actually increase our manual review time and so I think we’re going to be OK.” But Google's public statements have done little to assuage advertisers’ fears, said David Cohen, president, North America, for media buying firm Magna Global. Categorise content Privately, Google has gone into more detail about how it plans to combat the issue, including ratcheting up its algorithms to better categorise content and being more stringent about how content is labelled, Cohen said. But such additional controls would reduce the percentage of content that carries advertising and could disrupt the vibrant community of independent creators on YouTube, who drive traffic to the site and rely on revenue-sharing from advertising. YouTube faces a special imperative to keep creators happy as rivals such as Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc try to court talent for their own platforms, said Hank Green, a prominent YouTube creator who runs the VidCon conference. “YouTube has a decade-long head start, but obviously everyone wants a piece of the pie,” he said. Even before the most recent revelations about YouTube, control over online ad placement had become a hot button topic for advertisers. Social networks and news aggregators came under fire during and after the US presidential election for spreading fake news reports, and advertisers have also sought to avoid having their brands appear beside content that they categorize as hate speech. “Between non-human traffic and fraud, fake news and hate speech, brands are more concerned than ever,” said Marc Goldberg, CEO of Trust Metrics, a New York-based company that addresses ad fraud.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Wednesday March 29, 2017 News Business Larger / SmallerNight Mode Google parent loses $31b in value as ad crisis spirals out of control Joe Mayes 24 Mar 2017, 4:15 p.m. Major advertisers across Europe are still appearing alongside extremist YouTube videos days after technology giant Google said it was taking steps to protect its clients from inadvertently supporting hate. Major advertisers across Europe are still appearing alongside extremist YouTube videos days after technology giant Google said it was taking steps to protect its clients from inadvertently supporting hate. An anti-semitic clip claiming the existence of a "Jewish World Order" was featured alongside advertisements in Germany from insurer AXA, oil company Total in France, Range Rover vehicles in South Africa, footwear retailer Skopunkten and website Tradera in Sweden, searches of YouTube from each country found on Thursday. Separately, a sermon by preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril, who according to US prosecutors once took credit for a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia, can be viewed alongside advertisements from Nissan in Sweden and wireless carrier MTN Group in South Africa. Meanwhile, the Islamophobic English Defence League gathers support from advertisers Total, Netflix, IBM and watchmaker Tag Heuer International in France. The controversy over ad placement, now in its second week, is expanding at a pace Google has struggled to match in its response. Its parent company Alphabet's market value has dropped by about $US24 billion ($31 billion) this week. On Thursday, as Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt said Google could "get pretty close" to guaranteeing companies' ads won't be placed near hateful material, advertisers throughout Europe were confronting more than a dozen new examples and scrambling to protect their brands. "We didn't know that our ads were played in this context," Axa spokeswoman Anja Kroll said in an email. "We have immediately arranged for an update of the filters and stopped the delivery" of the ads because "diversity, tolerance and openness are values that are of key importance for us and that we practice daily." Awaiting answers While Axa hasn't pulled its ads from YouTube, the German unit is using "blacklist" filters to prevent its ads from appearing next to extremist, racist or other undesired content, Kroll said. In this case, she said, the filters apparently failed. "We don't comment on individual videos but as announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear," a Google spokesperson said. "We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers' brands." Range Rover said in an email it was suspending its YouTube campaign in South Africa while it investigates. Telenor Sweden, which had an ad showing before a propaganda video from a Swedish neo-Nazi group, also halted all YouTube advertising, according to Aron Samuelsson, a spokesman. Nissan said it was "urgently reviewing" with Google while Nilson Group, owner of Skopunkten, said it had asked its media agency about the ads and is "awaiting answers," according to Linda Fernell, a spokeswoman. Total, IBM, MTN, Tag Heuer, HBO and Netflix didn't respond or had no immediate comment. Tradera's owner, Paypal Holdings, declined to comment. In Sweden, an Ikea spot was found alongside a homophobic and anti-Semitic video entitled: "Gay Pride Parade a Tool of International Jews." An ad for HBO's "The Young Pope" found its way to the pre-roll for "Jewish Hypocrisy - Flooding Europe With Immigrants" in Spain. "It is completely unacceptable that Ikea appears in a context like this," spokeswoman Cecilia Nettelbladt Stenberg said by phone. "What we've done now is to ask our media agency to immediately investigate the reason behind this." Maximum volume The discomfort highlights the reliance of Google and Facebook on automated computer programs that maximise volume and have helped them dominate online advertising, through their popular sites and their advertising networks. Digital advertising grew by 17 per cent globally to $US178 billion ($233 billion) in 2016, according to marketing consultant Magna Global, which projects that digital-based ad sales will overtake TV to become the No. 1 media category this year. The global array of companies caught up in the controversy illustrates the scale of the problem for Google, which is facing financial and reputational damage from the crisis. Some of the world's biggest marketers halted spending on YouTube after a Times of London investigation revealed that ads were running alongside offensive content. "A cascade of major brand boycotts for Google ad spend (mostly non-search) has emerged, raising concerns on first-quarter and second-quarter results and the future of programmatic advertising," Justin Post, an analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a research note on Thursday, referencing the automated software programs Google uses to match advertisers with content online. JP Morgan Chase and Ford suspended their YouTube ads on Thursday. AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline and Verizon Communications have joined the boycott in recent days, after the BBC, Sainsbury, Volkswagen and Toyota said they had pulled ads in the UK. The latest examples show the scope of the Google's problem isn't confined to two large markets. It's global, affecting major advertisers in big European markets including Germany, France and Sweden, as well as South Africa. At Skopunkten, a major shoe-store chain in Sweden, spokeswoman Fernell said she was unaware of the "Jewish World Order" video but said the company had noticed some unwanted videos popping up in its YouTube campaigns. "I hope they can help us redirect the ads," she said. "We need to learn more about this." While Google's tools can be incredibly sophisticated, allowing ads to follow users from site to site, the software hasn't fully matched the human judgement necessary to protect brands from inadvertently funnelling cash to causes their customers would find objectionable. Increasing safeguards The high number of intermediaries in digital advertising further complicates the problem. So Google's announced fixes may not completely solve the challenge. "Google isn't yet fully addressing advertisers' concerns and needs to take stronger steps to regain the trust of brands," Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Google said on Tuesday that it was increasing safeguards to protect advertisers, such as automatically excluding ads from videos deemed "potentially objectionable" and giving advertisers more control over placement. While YouTube revenue isn't reported separately by Google, analysts estimate the video site brings in billions of dollars each year, and say it's among Google's fastest-growing businesses. Schmidt, in an appearance on Fox Business Network's "Mornings With Maria" on Thursday, said Google can generally ensure clients that their ads won't be placed next to "hate" content. "We match the ads and the content," Schmidt said, according to a transcript from Fox Business. "But because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn't match." He said that Google had tightened its policies and increased the amount of time it spends manually reviewing the content, "and so I think we're going to be okay."

Rohit KVN   March 24, 2017 18:16 IST [Representational Image] Top 5 smartwatches that will make you look class apart from just geek In Picture: SmartwatchesGoogle Blog Owing to lack of breakthrough innovations in smartphones, mobile-makers came up with digital watches with touch-sensitive screens and it became an instant hit among consumers. Samsung, Apple, Motorola, LG all launched their own smart wearables to cash-in on the craze. But, within a span of three years, the fad for smartwatches was beginning to fade; most probably, due to lack of creative design language. Also, most smartwatches had less value-added features, which only attracted niche tech-savvy users. However, things are beginning to change for good in the smartwatch industry with the entry of traditional Swiss timepiece-maker Tag Heuer and also digital watch pioneer Casio, who recently launched a new line of smart wristwatches with great design and a slew of cool features ranging from fitness to outdoor trekking, voice-search on Google and more, which we believe will definitely re-invigorate this industry and also attract more people. Also read: Samsung Galaxy S8 news: Target tipped to offer enticing gifts with Galaxy S7 successor in US; pre-order details revealed Here we have listed top five feature-rich smartwatches that will make you look classy and adventurous. Casio Edifice EQB501: The new Casio Edifice EQB501 series is unarguably the best looking wristwatch out there. It ticks all the three key aspects we expect in a smartwatch — visually appealing design language, wide functional capabilities and the most important, wireless mobile connectivity. With Casio Watch+ mobile app, Edifice EQB501 series owners, besides doing normal things like viewing current time, manage daylight saving time, stopwatch, alarm, sync with multiple timezones, can use it to track phone (compatible with Apple iOS and Google Android mobiles), and also view speed indicator, as well. It comes in a traditional circular dial design and is made of tough and rugged metal case, which is capable of surviving close to 100 meters underwater, as well. Casio Edifice EQB501Edifice official page (screen-shot) The most interesting aspect of the Casio's new watch is that it does not require electric charging. Edifice EQB501 series comes with a advanced rechargeable battery, which takes power directly from Sun solar energy drawn via Tough Solar glass panel on the dial. It is said to boast shadow-dispersing solar panel with excellent power-generation efficiency. It is set to go on sale next month, but price details are yet to be announced. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45: Switzerland-based Tag Heuer, which has been in the watch making business for more than 150 years, has embraced digital age with élan. It's newly launched Connected Modular 45 is poised to take on first generation smartwatch-makers. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 offers both, the traditional look and also high-tech features, which will certainly please all age groups. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45Tag Heuer official page (screen-shot) As the name suggests, it takes customisation to a whole new level. Tag Heuer is offering the watch 56 different styles with numerous choices in terms of straps, lugs and buckles, case materials and settings, including a diamond-set option, satin and polished Grade-5 Titanium modules. It also allows owners to switch between connected and mechanical modules, which no other watch-makers offer at this moment. It can also survive 50 meters underwater and runs on Android Wear 2.0 with Google Assistant support powered by Intel Atom Z34XX chipset, has 4GB internal storage, offers 29 hours of active power. It sports 1.39-inch super AMOLED screen with 2.5D Sapphire cover glass. Others features include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and NFC (Near Field Communication). Note: Tag Heuer Modular 45 also supports Apple iOS, as well.] Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45Tag Heuer official page (screen-shot) With so much features tucked in to the small confines of the watch, Tag Heuer Modular 45 does not come cheap. Its base model costs a $1,650 and depending on the type of material used in the making of watch module case and customisation option chosen by the consumer, it will go up to a whopping $18,850. Garmin Fenix 5X: Garmin Fenix 5X is the most rugged smartwatch in our list. Its screen is made of sapphire crystal with high-resolution, full-color Garmin Chroma Display having LED backlighting, which offers optimized viewing experience at any light conditions even under direct sunlight. Its bezel is made of super sturdy PVD-coated stainless steel and the reinforced buttons on the contours guarantees extra durability. Consumers can opt for either metal or silicon based straps. It is capable of sustaining dense water pressure up to 100 meters.

Depending on the type of straps, consumers will have to shell out between $649.99 and $849.99 to buy Garmin Fenic 5X. Though, the price is expensive, it's worth every penny. Samsung Gear S3 Frontier: Gear S3 comes in two models -- classic and frontier, which is a rugged variant for outdoors. They house almost the same hardware, but differ in a few aspects. We recommend the latter, as it boasts additional features such as LTE support and built-in speakers, wherein users can activate voice messaging and listen to their favorite tunes. And also, the Frontier model features rugged exterior design, best suited for people who love trekking. It sports a 1.3-inch circular super AMOLED display with AOD (Always-On-Display) feature and IP68 water-and-dust resistant certification. Under the hood, it houses 1.0GHz dual-core processor, 768MB RAM and 4GB inbuilt storage.

(Source: AP) AT&T, Verizon and several other major advertisers are suspending their marketing campaigns on Google’s YouTube site after discovering their brands have been appearing alongside videos promoting terrorism and other unsavory subjects. The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars. YouTube’s popularity stems from its massive and eclectic library of video, spanning everything from polished TV clips to raw diatribes posted by people bashing homosexuals. But that diverse selection periodically allows ads to appear next to videos that marketers find distasteful, despite Google’s efforts to prevent it from happening. Google depends largely on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. Earlier this week, Google vowed to step up its efforts to block ads on “hateful, offensive and derogatory” videos. “We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a Tuesday blog post. As part of Google’s solution to the problem, Schindler promised to hire “significant numbers” of employees to review YouTube videos and flag them as inappropriate for ads. He also predicted YouTube would be able to address advertisers’ concerns through Google’s recent advancements in artificial intelligence — technology parlance for computers that learn to think like humans. But that promise so far hasn’t appeased AT&T, Verizon Communications and an expanding global list of advertisers that includes Volkswagen, Audi, HSBC Holdings, the Royal Bank of Scotland and L’Oreal. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” AT&T said in a statement. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” By extending its ban to everything beyond Google’s search results, AT&T is also effectively pulling its ads from more than two million other websites that depend on Google to deliver ads to their pages. In its statement, Verizon said it decided to pull ads from YouTube to protect its website while it investigates the “weak links” among its digital advertising partners. Both AT&T and Verizon may have an ulterior motive to make YouTube look like an untrustworthy spot for marketers because both companies are trying to sell more digital ads in their own networks. YouTube has become one of the fastest growing parts of Google’s ad system, which generated $79 billion in revenue last year. Google doesn’t disclose how much of that came from YouTube ads, but the research firm eMarketer estimated that the video site accounted for $5.6 billion that amount. EMarketer projected YouTube’s advertising will rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, but that prediction came before marketers began to suspend their spending. The YouTube boycott began late last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in videos delving into contentious themes.

Close tabs to the left, tabs to the right, or other tabs (all but the active tab). Same as above, but including pinned tabs. Close tabs of the same host, same domain, or same URL. Same as above, but including the active tab. Close highlighted tabs. Close currently loading tabs. Close loaded tabs. Close discarded tabs. Close discardable tabs. Tab Ninja offers plenty of tab control options to Chrome. You use the extension by right-clicking anywhere on the active page, and selecting Tab Ninja from the context menu that opens. The extension is very powerful when it comes to controlling tabs. There are downsides however currently, mostly from a usability point of view. First of all, it cannot be used when you right-click on tabs in Chrome. It would be better for obvious reasons if the extension would display its options on tab right-clicks as well. The second issue is that you don't get any filtering options. There is no options page right now that lets you hide some of the tab control options. The menu is quite large right now, and it would be useful if you could hide the options that you will never use to reduce the menu and improve the accessibility of the options that you use. Closing Words Tab Ninja is a great tab extension for Chrome, especially when you consider that Google will remove tab related context menu options from the Chrome browser in the near future. It may be a way out for users who rely on close tabs to the right, and close other tabs options. Now You: Which tab-based operations do you perform regularly?

Close highlighted tabs. Close currently loading tabs. Close loaded tabs. Close discarded tabs. Close discardable tabs. That doesn't leave much value for me. So I probably would not install it especially without right click integration. Regarding tab control, I'd like to see something like the Pale Moon (and FarFux) add-on like Tab Mix Plus for Chrome. OK trolls. Don't jump on me. I know Google doesn't allow that type of control over the interface. Reply Jeff-FL March 24, 2017 at 8:20 pm # I must be the only guy in the world who never has more than 3 or 4 tabs open at a time. If i'm done looking at a site, I close it and move on. Always hear guys saying "i have 50 tabs open at a time". what? why? how can you even find shit that way? Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

It is now time for YouTube's "Extremist Hate-Speech Hour", occasionally brought to you in association with, until recently, some of the biggest brands in the world, including none other than AT&T and Verizon, among others. Not any more of course, because the two telcos are among a growing number of prominent companies that pulled their ad spend from YouTube and Google this week, after their adverts appeared alongside extremist material.

Not any more of course, because the two telcos are among a growing number of prominent companies that pulled their ad spend from YouTube and Google this week, after their adverts appeared alongside extremist material. The wave of withdrawals started to gather pace last week as several European advertisers, including Sky, Vodafone, and O2 UK, pulled their ads. This week, the backlash reached the U.S., prompting Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, to invoke parent company Alphabet's recently-revised mantra, and do the right thing, which in this case meant apologising, and pledging to be better in future. In a conciliatory blog post, Schindler recognised YouTube's importance for upholding free speech, but also acknowledged that major advertisers don't want their logos to appear next to a stream of invective spewing from the mouth of some deluded scumbag. Google is supposed to be able to automatically filter out dodgy content when placing adverts, which is no easy task when 400 videos per minute are uploaded to YouTube, but it seems there is plenty of room for improvement. "Recently, we had a number of cases where brands' ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologise," Schindler wrote. "We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us." While all the negative publicity this week has been directed at Google, according to telecoms analyst and Radio Free Mobile founder Richard Windsor, another ad-funded Internet giant has greater cause for concern. Facebook faces "a much more serious problem," he claimed. Google's advances in artificial intelligence means it is well equipped to trawl through a vast amount of content and filter out extreme material, but the same cannot be said for Facebook, he said. Facebook is already working on tools to flag up potentially fake news, and has added warnings to graphic content, but Windsor claims it is still "far behind its global peers when it comes to AI. "This means that while it is sitting on the world's second-largest treasure trove of data, it is unable to understand what most of it is and is therefore unable to weed out content that is objectionable to its customers." Potentially alienating advertisers represents a much more serious issue for Facebook than Google, Windsor said. He estimates that YouTube and display advertising accounts for around 12% of Google's gross revenues. At Facebook, advertising accounts for a much larger chunk of turnover. If and when a backlash against ads appearing alongside extreme content hits Facebook, "it will hit much harder and it is likely to last longer," Windsor warned. It is also worth considering that because Google is the first to face this kind of public crisis, it can reasonably be expected to be the first to address it and move on. Schindler said Google has pledged to crack down on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. "This includes removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people based on their race, religion, gender or similar categories. This change will enable us to take action, where appropriate, on a larger set of ads and sites," he said. "We'll be hiring significant numbers of people and developing new tools powered by our latest advancements in AI and machine learning to increase our capacity to review questionable content for advertising," he continued. "In cases where advertisers find their ads were served where they shouldn't have been, we plan to offer a new escalation path to make it easier for them to raise issues. In addition, we'll soon be able to resolve these cases in less than a few hours." One major industry player that has also been busy in the advertising world this week is Altice. The multinational cable group on Tuesday struck a deal to acquire online video ad specialist Teads, in a deal valuing the company at €285 million. Teads is a marketplace that sits between brands and publishers, placing the former's adverts alongside the latter's content. It claims to reach an audience of 1.2 billion. It is not a YouTube; it does not have to deal directly with nutters uploading abhorrent material to the Internet. In a statement, Altice CEO Michel Combes said the deal "will enable us to offer a truly unique value proposition to brands and agencies on the one hand, and the media industry, programmers and distributors on the other." Based on Google's experience this week, Altice might just also be having a quick glance through the list of 8,000 'specialist publishers' on Teads' books, just to be on the safe side...

Google said voice numbers will continue to be supported after 22 May. “This change only applies to SMS text messages sent and received from carrier phone numbers,” said Google. The company said it will prepare users for this change by showing an in-app message from 27 March. Hangouts users will be prompted to choose another default messaging app already installed on their phone. If none exist, they will be directed to the Google Play store to find a new SMS messaging app. “Choosing a new messaging app will not impact existing SMS messages. All messages will be accessible in the new messaging app,” said Google.

The rebranding was announced earlier, and now in a mail to G Suite administrators, Google informed about the change which could take effect from May 22.

Google wants to turn its old Hangouts app into an enterprise-oriented application. The rebranding was announced earlier, and now in a mail to G Suite administrators, Google informed about the change which could take effect from May 22. Google is also showing keen interest on Android Messages, so it is not surprising that Hangouts’ SMS service is being phased out. In the mail, posted on Reddit, Google says that the move its directed towards improving the most popular features of the app, and those are video conferencing and group chat. For consumer-friendly alternatives, Google is moving towards Android Messages. This move comes as Google is shifting the focus of Hangouts towards repositioning the messaging service to counter workplace communications tool Slack. Google will formally notify the users about the change, by sending a message in Hangouts for Android from March 27. It will inform them about the change and enable them to select an alternative messaging app. If there is no alternative present on the device, the user will be automatically directed towards Google PlayStore to find another application. Since a default SMS client setting capability already present in Google Android, all the earlier messages will be accessible from the new app. With such an array of apps for messaging it is rather an intelligent move by Google than an innovative one. It is a good time to download Android Messages of video-oriented Duo if you still use Hangouts for SMS service.

An anti-Semitic clip claiming the existence of a “Jewish World Order” was featured alongside advertisements in Germany from insurer AXA SA, oil company Total in France, Range Rover vehicles in South Africa, footwear retailer Skopunkten and website Tradera in Sweden, Bloomberg searches of YouTube from each country found on Thursday. The video was also paired with brands in Asia -- Castrol lubricants in India and Cow & Gate infant formula in Hong Kong. Share this story File picture: Google via EPA A separate sermon by preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril, who according to US prosecutors once took credit for a terrorist bombing in Saudi Arabia, can be viewed alongside advertisements from Nissan in Sweden and wireless carrier MTN Group in South Africa. Meanwhile, the Islamophobic English Defence League gathers support from advertisers Total, Netflix Inc., IBM and watchmaker Tag Heuer International in France. The controversy over ad placement, now in its second week, is expanding across the globe at a pace Alphabet Inc.’s Google has struggled to match in its response. On Thursday, as Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt said Google could “get pretty close” to guaranteeing companies’ ads won’t be placed near hateful material, advertisers throughout Europe were confronting more than a dozen new examples and scrambling to protect their brands. “We didn’t know that our ads were played in this context,” Axa spokeswoman Anja Kroll said in an email. “We have immediately arranged for an update of the filters and stopped the delivery” of ads with these videos because "diversity, tolerance and openness are values that are of key importance for us and that we practice daily.” Awaiting answers While Axa hasn’t pulled its ads from YouTube, the German unit is using "blacklist" filters to prevent its ads from appearing next to extremist, racist or other undesired content, Kroll said. In this case, she said, the filters apparently failed. “We don’t comment on individual videos but as announced, we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear,” a Google spokesperson said. “We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.” Range Rover said in an email it was suspending its YouTube campaign in South Africa while it investigates. Telenor Sweden, which had an ad showing before a propaganda video from a Swedish neo-Nazi group, also halted all YouTube advertising, according to Aron Samuelsson, a spokesman. Nissan said it was “urgently reviewing” with Google while Nilson Group, owner of Skopunkten, said it had asked its media agency about the ads and is “awaiting answers,” according to Linda Fernell, a spokeswoman. Total, IBM, MTN, Tag Heuer, Netflix, Castrol India and Cow&Gate owner Danone didn’t respond or had no immediate comment. Tradera’s owner, Paypal Holdings, declined to comment. Read also: Google ad crisis spreads In Sweden, an Ikea AB spot was found alongside a homophobic and anti-Semitic video entitled: “Gay Pride Parade a Tool of International Jews,” while another clip in India tied the so-called gay agenda to “Satanic Illuminati” and touted the F3 Plus smartphone from China’s Oppo. An ad for HBO’s “The Young Pope” found its way to the pre-roll for “Jewish Hypocrisy - Flooding Europe With Immigrants” in Spain. “It is completely unacceptable that IKEA appears in a context like this,” spokeswoman Cecilia Nettelbladt Stenberg said by phone. “What we’ve done now is to ask our media agency to immediately investigate the reason behind this.” “We don’t control the YouTube ad placement, but we greatly oppose it,” HBO said in an email. “We will be taking steps to get it removed.” Oppo didn’t respond. Maximum volume The advertisers’ discomfort highlights the reliance of Google and Facebook Inc. on automated software that maximizes volume to help them dominate online advertising. Digital advertising grew by 17 percent globally to $178 billion in 2016, according to marketing consultant Magna Global, which projects that digital-based ad sales will overtake TV to become the No. 1 media category this year. The global array of companies caught up in the controversy illustrates the scale of the problem for Google, which risks potential financial and reputational damage. The company was already facing claims in lawsuit by the family of a terror attack victim that it profits from ads linked to terrorist propaganda promoting violence. The latest crisis erupted after a Times of London investigation last week revealed ads running alongside offensive content. Alphabet’s market value has dropped by about $24 billion this week. “A cascade of major brand boycotts for Google ad spend (mostly non-search) has emerged, raising concerns on first quarter and second quarter results and the future of programmatic advertising,” Justin Post, an analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a research note on Thursday, referencing the automated software Google uses to match advertisers with content online. JPMorgan Chase & Company and Ford Motor suspended their YouTube ads on Thursday. AT&T, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline and Verizon Communications joined the boycott earlier this week, after British Broadcasting Corporation, Sainsbury, Volkswagen and Toyota Motor said they had pulled ads in the UK The latest examples show the global scope of the Google’s problem, reaching beyond the UK and US to big European markets like Germany, France and Sweden, as well as Hong Kong, India and South Africa. At Skopunkten, a major shoe-store chain in Sweden, spokeswoman Fernell said she was unaware of the “Jewish World Order” video but said the company had noticed some unwanted videos popping up in its YouTube campaigns. “I hope they can help us redirect the ads,” she said. “We need to learn more about this.” While Google’s tools can be incredibly sophisticated, allowing ads to follow users from site to site, the software hasn’t fully matched the human judgment necessary to protect brands from inadvertently funnelling cash to causes their customers would find objectionable. The high number of intermediaries in digital advertising further complicates the problem. So Google’s announced fixes may not completely solve the challenge. “Google isn’t yet fully addressing advertisers’ concerns and needs to take stronger steps to regain the trust of brands,” Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients Thursday. Google said Tuesday that it was increasing safeguards to protect advertisers, such as automatically excluding ads from videos deemed “potentially objectionable” and giving advertisers more control over placement. While YouTube revenue isn’t reported separately by Google, analysts estimate the video site brings in billions of dollars each year, and say it’s among Google’s fastest-growing businesses. Schmidt, in an appearance on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings With Maria” on Thursday, said Google can generally ensure clients that their ads won’t be placed next to “hate” content. “We match the ads and the content,” Schmidt said, according to a transcript from Fox Business. “But because we source the ads from everywhere, every once in a while somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn’t match.” He said that Google had tightened its policies and increased the amount of time it spends manually reviewing the content, “and so I think we’re going to be okay.” Bloomberg Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 Zuma tells Communist Party Gordhan is out 2 Molefe to be Minister of Finance - sources 3 #AhmedKathrada: Details of funeral released 4 Gordhan says 'let's wait and see' on sacking 5 PICS: Weapons find in Randburg triggers terror plot fears Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Mar 24, 2017 at 7:39AM The growth of smartphones and tablets over the last decade has been a boon to the video game industry. Mobile gaming is now a key driver of growth for the gaming industry, and this presents a great opportunity for investors interested in video game stocks.   As with many industries, there are winners and losers in mobile gaming, so investors need to be careful if they wish to pursue this area for investment. Let's take a look at the impact mobile gaming is having, and then we'll take a look at the best options investors have to benefit from this fast-growing market. Mobile gaming is a big business SuperData Research reported the mobile gaming market reached $40.6 billion in worldwide revenue in 2016, an increase of 18% over 2015. According to another report from Newzoo, mobile game sales represent 37% of the revenue generated in the video game industry. Digital and physical PC/console game sales combined still control the majority of revenue in the game industry, but this won't last long as mobile continues to grow in the double-digits, while PC and console sales are growing less than 5% annually. Engagement levels on mobile games is higher than streaming video services. IMAGE SOURCE: PIXABAY.  The key players in mobile gaming The two dominant mobile platforms where game apps are distributed are Apple's iOS and Google's Android. As of September 2016, Apple and Google were the fifth and eighth largest game companies by revenue, respectively. According to Newzoo, Apple generated $4.2 billion from game apps downloaded on its App Store, and Google generated $2.7 billion from Android games. These would be great choices for investors looking to ride the wave of mobile gaming growth, but the revenue these tech juggernauts generate from game apps is peanuts relative to Apple and Google's total annual revenue. Then there are the mobile game developers, which is the purest way to invest in mobile gaming. But once again, there's a problem. Glu Mobile (NASDAQ:GLUU) and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) are two notable mobile game developers that are publicly traded, but the first one cannot earn a profit, and the second hasn't demonstrated it can grow consistently. In addition, some mobile game developers are either not publicly traded, or are traded on foreign exchanges, making it difficult for U.S.-based investors to own a decent mobile game stock. Some of the best-managed mobile game companies have been acquired by major game publishers, which brings me to what I believe is the best option. The better way to invest in mobile gaming The best option for investors is to consider the top game publishers: Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), and Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO). Unlike other options, these companies are indifferent to the platforms for games. The focus for these companies is making great games on whatever platform -- mobile, Virtual Reality, console, or PC -- will generate the best return on investment. In addition, the game publishers are putting cash to work for shareholders by acquiring the best-managed, most profitable, and growing mobile game studios. This option makes more sense for investors since the major game publishers are able to use ample cash resources to acquire the best mobile game companies that may not be publicly traded, allowing shareholders to benefit from the best-of-breed mobile studios without taking on the risk of owning a thinly traded mobile game stock that doesn't have a long track record of financial success. Three top choices In 2016, Activision Blizzard acquired Ireland-based King Digital Entertainment for $5.9 billion. King is the developer of top-grossing mobile games Candy Crush and Bubble Witch. The deal was highly accretive to Activision's bottom line in 2016, helping the game company increase its annual cash flow from $1.2 billion in 2015 to $2.2 billion in 2016. Activision has also released mobile versions of some of its PC/console franchises such as Call of Duty and Skylanders. Electronic Arts and Take-Two's portion of cash flow derived from mobile games is smaller than Activision's, but still an important contributor to margins. Along with other forms of digital content sales, mobile games are freeing game publishers from the dependency of physical game sales and helping game companies expand margins in the process.      Take-Two recently announced the acquisition of Spain-based mobile developer Social Point for $250 million. Social Point's revenue has grown 29% annualized since 2013, to $90 million, and it generated $19.9 million in operating income for 2016. This is an operating margin over 20%, whereas Take-Two reported an operating loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. This acquisition will not dramatically improve Take-Two's bottom line, but more acquisitions like this could be a game-changer for the company as it seeks to diversify its revenue channels. Electronic Arts has had a solid presence in mobile for several years with a series of acquisitions including Plants vs. Zombies developer PopCap Games and Icycle: On Thin Ice developer Chillingo, which is based in the U.K. The company has also been very successful in developing mobile versions of its best-selling console franchises like Madden NFL and its FIFA soccer game. EA's revenue from mobile games grew 14% to $626 million over the trailing-12-month period.   Mobile gaming is changing the game Americans spent more time playing a mobile game than watching streaming video on sites like Netflix and YouTube in 2016. The growth and player engagement level of mobile gaming is changing the landscape of the gaming industry. Rather than depending on physical game sales, mobile games have opened up a new source of growth and better margins for game companies. If you are looking for a way to invest in the growth of mobile gaming without taking on high risk, consider buying shares in Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, or Take-Two that are able to acquire the best mobile game companies from around the world on behalf of shareholders.

Search for: Menu Home Headlines Politics Health Entertainment Business Sports Education Feature General Home / Business / Google advertising row spreads to US brands Google advertising row spreads to US brands Posted on March 24, 2017 by Josephine Nettey in Business At least four major US firms have pulled millions of dollars in advertising from Google’s platform amid rows over extremist content. The Times reported that telecoms firms AT&T and Verizon, as well as car rental company Enterprise and pharmaceutical giant GSK, have withdrawn all non-search advertising. An investigation by the newspaper found major brands were appearing next to YouTube videos promoting extremist views – generating revenues for the creators. The company has apologised and promised better tools for advertisers. Despite Google’s efforts to contain the row, which began in the UK earlier this week, it appears to have now caught the attention of the US advertising industry – creating a huge problem for Google as it seeks to reassure brands their ad spend is not funding hate groups. According to The Times, Verizon’s advertisements were appearing along side videos made by Wagdi Ghoneim, an Egyptian cleric who had been banned from the US over extremism, and Hanif Qureshi, whose teachings inspired the assassination of a Pakistani politician. Raising the bar “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” AT&T said in a statement on Wednesday. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” The UK-based investigation led more than 250 brands to pull their advertising. In a blog post published on Monday, Google’s chief business officer Philipp Schindler announced the company was expanding its policies on hate speech to include videos targeting vulnerable groups. In response to the latest boycott from the US brands, Google said on Wednesday: “We’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear.” “We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.” Google is the dominant player in online advertising, and ads are by far the company’s biggest source of money. In 2016, the firm generated $80bn in ad revenue – accounting for almost 90% of the firm’s total income for the year. Of the boycotts announced on Wednesday, both Verizon and AT&T have major online advertising ambitions of their own. Verizon in particular recently agreed to purchase embattled web portal firm Yahoo for $4.48bn – a deal it hopes will help it compete with Google for ad sales.   Post navigation Previous Previous post: Emirates Spreads Happiness to its Customers and Employees Next Next post: Bog Likely To Reduce Monetary Policy Rate By 100 Basis Points Share News Tweet Related Posts Should Facebook Offer A Paid, Ad-Free Version? “Let’s Change The Way We Do Business In Agriculture”, Says FARA Boss Africa Can Become The Next China – Mahama NCA Cushions Consumers As Parliament Okays ICH Regulations The Solar Park in Freetown Gov’t To Ensure That Subsidies Reach Targeted Groups – Energy Minister Radio online © 2016 The Herald Ghana.
