Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle The self-driving car’s family tree 1 / 3 Back to Gallery As recent lawsuits show, many California companies developing self-driving cars are related to each other. It’s not always a happy family. Key engineers and executives from pioneering companies such as Google and Tesla have jumped ship to form their own self-driving startups, such as Lucid Motors and Otto. Google’s program, in turn, was shaped by a handful of engineers from two universities: Stanford and Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, a hotbed of self-driving research since the 1980s. Given the high stakes, it’s not surprising that some of the companies where these engineers landed don’t get along. In January, Tesla sued one of its former self-driving executives, Sterling Anderson, and his new startup, Aurora Innovation. Anderson co-founded Aurora last year with Chris Urmson, the former head of Google’s self-driving unit, which is now known as Waymo. Driving the Future Future self-driving cars will have ‘Intel inside’ And last month, Waymo sued Otto, founded by former Google researcher Anthony Levandowski. Waymo also sued Uber, which bought Otto last year. Both Tesla and Waymo accused their former employees of stealing trade secrets (Aurora denied the allegations and Uber said it is reviewing the suit). Here’s a partial family tree of the self-driving industry, showing how some of the key players have moved from one company or school to another. Give it a year, and the tree may well grow a few more branches. David R. Baker is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: dbaker@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @DavidBakerSF David R.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Samsung Galaxy S8 vs. Google Pixel 2 Rishabh Jain International Business TimesMarch 5, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Google confirmed Friday that a new Pixel device would launch in 2017 with a similar price tag as the previous one.More It is confirmed — a Pixel successor will be released in 2017. Google’s flagship device will face competition from the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy S8, Apple’s iPhone 8 and LG’s G6. But the device’s main rival in the market will definitely be the Galaxy S8. Both companies will have a lot to prove with their devices. While the Galaxy S8 is Samsun's first major device post the Galaxy Note 7 scandal, the Pixel 2 — as it is expected to be called — is Google’s chance to build on the initial success of the Pixel device. It also presents a chance for Google to improve on the hardware and software flaws that the device suffered from despite its initial success. Let’s see how the two devices stack up against each other in terms of specs: Performance Both the Google Pixel 2 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 are expected to come with a 10nm technology based Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. While Samsung has the entire supply of the processor reserved for the S8, which is expected to launch in March or April, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to release in October 2017, there is a fair chance that the company gets its hands on the processor. Display The Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to come in 5-inch and 6-inch models, while Pixel series 2 is also expected to have a similar lineup. While the edge-to-edge display for the Samsung Galaxy S8 is mostly confirmed, according to Pocket Lint, if Google wants to compete with the major flagships in the market, it will have to endow its Pixel 2 device with one. While Samsung is expected to go for a display-embedded fingerprint sensor for the S8, Google is expected to continue with the rear-mounted one on the current Pixel device. Camera According to Sammobile, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to come with a dual-camera setup comprising of a 12-megapixel camera sensor accompanied by a 13-megapixel one, which will help create a better depth of field in images. Google will have much to build on for its Google Pixel 2 handset since its current device has been rated as the best smartphone camera yet by DxO Mark. According to 9to5 Google, the company is currently developing a camera lens, which could have an improved low-light condition performance. In addition to this, both devices are also expected to have waterproof bodies. While Samsung already espouses the standard in its existing device – the Samsung Galaxy S7, Google is expected to endow its Pixel 2 device with either an IP67 or IP68 certified body, according to Trusted Reviews. While the Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to have a price tag of $899, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to be launched later in October at $649.

Home News Features Events Music Movies & TV Style Beauty Weddings Career Relationships Living Inspired! 17 year Old Cameroonian Nji Collins Gbah Emerges as First African Winner of Google’s Coding Competition as #BringBackOurInternet Protests Continue in His Region 03.03.2017 at 7:11 pm By BellaNaija.com 1 Comment Since January 18th, internet connectivity has been shut down in the regions of North-West and South-West – the English speaking parts of the country – following government’s order. Luckily for 17 year old Nji Collins Gbah, this happened a day after the deadline for submissions for Google’s annual coding competition – Google Code-in for pre-university students between the ages of 13 and 17. Nji told BBC how he completed 20 tasks in the competition between November (2016) and mid-January (2017). He said one of the tasks took one full week to complete. More than 1,300 youngsters from 62 countries took part in this year’s competition. Nji said he had been learning how to code for two years mainly from online sources and books. Nji lives in Bamenda, North-West Cameroon where the people have accused the government of discrimination, adding that they are excluded from state jobs as a result of their limited French language skills. This led to protests on the streets, and the authorities have responded with scores of arrests and a text-message campaign warning people of long jail terms for “spreading false news” or “malicious use of social media”. Nji received news about two weeks after the internet went dead, that he had been selected as one of the 34 Grand Prize winners in the competition. “I was really, really amazed. It meant my hard work writing a lot of code had really paid off,” Nji, who moved in with his cousins in the country’s capital, Yaounde to get internet connection, said. “I wanted to get a connection so I could continue studying and keep in touch with Google,” Nji said. Part of Nji’s prize include visiting Google’s headquarters in Silicon Valley for four days this June and meeting its top engineers . “Hopefully I would like to work there one day, if that is possible,” he says. Nji who is currently working on building his knowledge of artificial intelligence, neural networks and deep learning, says Nji says he hopes to finish school in Bamenda, and then study computer science at a good university. “I’m trying to develop my own model for data compression, using deep learning and machine learning,” he said. “No, no-one,” Nji said when asked if anyone from the government had been in touch.

"OTT (over-the-top) players and telecom players are very happily co-existing. Gone are the tensions and I think they love putting up more networks, lower the prices," Mittal told PTI in an interview here. Operators have been demanding that app-based calling and messaging services should be brought under the licensing regime. However, internet firms have been opposing any such move as it would scuttle innovation, affordable or almost free messaging services and adversely impact people adopting internet. "This is a digital society with collaborative effort but it can't be said that telecom operators have no role to play and only OTT players (internet-based calling and messaging providers) will do it. "They cannot do it without backbone that telecom networks have to built. This will go hand in hand that is why our relationship with Google, Facebook , Apple, Whatsapp, Hike ... very healthy," Mittal said. Telecom operators have complained to the government and the regulator TRAI that internet-based calling and messaging companies are making a dent on their revenues by providing the same services without having need to follow rules and regulations applicable on mobile services firms. Mittal said that telecom operators are unable to match the rates of OTT players due to high capital expenditure. "You must remember that OTT players have no capital expenditure. Their market caps are through the roofs, they have to spend nothing. Telecom companies have to spend 200 billion dollars in capex," Mittal said. As per experts, typically an average voice user ends up consuming around 400 minutes of network time in a month which if delivered using mobile broadband service like 3G and 4G translates into 18 to 72 MB (MegaBytes) per month. Telecom operators are now offering 1GB (1024 MB) of mobile internet for around Rs 50 these days which is more than enough for consumers to meet their monthly calling needs. When asked about private players' opposition to app-based calling plan of state-run BSNL for customer traveling abroad, Mittal said that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) must clarify rules around app-based calling." "We have been saying same service same rules. You just clarify the rules. TRAI must clarify that as simple as that. You must understand that there is no case that BSNL has any significant technology edge. "On the contrary, given the difficulty public sector has getting to newer technology, private sector is way ahead. It is not that private sector does not has technology, it's the regulation which has to be same service same rules," Mittal said. Telecom firms under the Cellular Operator Association of India (COAI) have approached the regulator against BSNL's fixed mobile telephony services. BSNL's limited fixed mobile telephony service is an app-based calling service that virtually turns mobiles into cordless phone working in sync with landlines to make and receive calls within home premises. The app only needs to connect with internet to work and can be used from overseas as well without having to pay for international roaming charges. In its letter to TRAI, COAI alleged that the BSNL's service bypasses Interconnect Usage Charges (IUC) in form of termination charges. Incumbent telecom operators have opposed reduction or removal of IUC which is charged by one telecom operator from another for carrying calls or SMSes on its network. These charges do not exist in case of communications made over internet. Mittal said that IUC should stay as there is cost incurred for completing or carrying calls on telecom networks. "Why should it (IUC) go away. Their is cost to be paid for all media that you put in," Mittal said. TRAI is working on net neutrality and interconnection usage charges which are expected to resolve regulation around app-based calling and messaging services. "Our view is same service same rules. If you are going to give different set of rules which are light touch and favourable, just give the same to us," Mittal said. The Bharti Airtel founder said that during his tenure as chairman of global industry body GSMA he worked with all operators to reduce drastically international roaming charges and protect consumers from bill shocks. "In international roaming we have made move. You will see during my term, we have already given our announcement. We ate down by over 90 per cent from April 1. Trend will start to pick. During my rule international roaming will be thing of the past. There will be some extra charge that people will pay in per day packs but gone  are the days of high bill shocks and atrociously high tariff that roaming currently has," Mittal said TAGS Sunil Mittal O P E N Jobs Wisdom Jobs Sarkari Result Freejobalert Latest OPPO replaces Star as new Team India sponsor Popular Bengali singer Kalikaprasad passes away Fire breaks out in Bihar's Champaran; 500 huts gutted Nine injured in blast in Bhopal-Ujjain train Finance Bill will be passed in Parliament before Mar. 31: Jaitley Seven minor girls in Kerala orphanage raped for 2 months, six arrested Gayatri Prajapati case: Two more arrested from Noida India four wickets away from victory in Bengaluru Test Gallery Massive Hong Kong shark fin seizure as ban flouted Festival of colour sees a grand start with Lathmar Holi in Uttar Pradesh arrow Videos Hand of Pakistani terrorist organization behind 26/11 terrorist attacks in Mumbai: Durrani British woman raped, held hostage in outback Australia arrow FOLLOW US Copyrights New Indian Express.2017 Dinamani | Kannada Prabha | Samakalika Malayalam | Malayalam Vaarika | Indulgexpress | Edex Live Contact Us | About Us | Careers | Privacy Policy | Search | Terms of Use | Advertise With Us Home | Nation | World | Cities | Business | Columns | Entertainment | Sport | Magazine | The Sunday Standard
Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About March 7, 2017 Mycelia + Sawdust = House? 52 Comments by: Michael Uttmark March 5, 2017 Take a guess. What is the featured picture for this article? If you’re channeling your inner Google image recognition, you might say: “Best guess for this image: rock.” But, like Google, you’d be wrong. Instead, what you see are bricks made out of fungi obtained from tissues of mycelia. By taking fungi obtained from tissues of mycelia and storing them in a jar filled with a growth medium (usually sawdust), MycoWorks is creating all sorts of materials with exciting properties. In just three to seven days, the fungi and sawdust mixture expands and forms into clumps of material, which are then used to create products like handbags, purses, bricks, you name it. According to co-founder Phil Ross, “production of this material is similar to making ravioli from scratch, and the final product is more resilient than concrete.” The resulting materials are buoyant, self-extinguishing and stress dissipating. Moreover, the bricks are alive up until they are put in a kiln. This means bricks that are placed next to each other will grow together, effectively enabling a structure to be made out of just brick, no mortar. And, while they’re not 3D printed, houses made in this fashion have great potential. If these cool new materials have got you excited, and you want to get cozy with the fungus among us, why not go all out with an automated mushroom cultivator? Video after the break. Disclaimer: While this video seems to be from a collaboration with Mazda and includes some marketing, it is well done, and describes their idea well.

In the end its still biodegradable and organic (meaning it will burn eventually). And its doubtful it will remain buoyant without additional treatment sounds to me more like it would soak and sink. Report comment Reply RandyKC says: March 5, 2017 at 1:35 pm I haven’t seen a vegetative fungus yet that can stand up to being autoclaved much less fired in a kiln to over 1000*C. It would take a very high mineral content to have enough inorganic minerals to form a brick. I’m sorry. I call BS on this. Report comment Reply Greenaum says: March 5, 2017 at 3:12 pm Maybe it’s not a kiln so much as an autoclave. The purpose just being to kill the fungus, to stop it growing into your food cupboards and eating your neighbours’ houses. I would worry about inhabiting a house where the bricks are microbial ecosystems, surely there’s some horrible lung infection waiting to move into a niche nobody noticed. Then again, killing the fungus doesn’t stop it from being biological, and just as edible to whichever new passing microbes. Isn’t your fungus house going to rot? Or infest you with diseases? Maybe this fungus stuff will be good for artificial leather. I’d want it dead, dry, and away from any soil or other teeming substances, if I were going to use it for anything.

The AImotive office is in a small converted house at the end of a quiet residential street in sunny Mountain View, spitting distance from Google’s headquarters. Outside is a branded Toyota Prius covered in cameras, one of three autonomous cars the Hungarian company is testing in the sleepy neighbourhood. It’s a popular testing ground: one of Google’s driverless cars, now operating under spin-out company Waymo, zips past the office each lunchtime. While other autonomous car projects, including those from Waymo and Uber, rely on an expensive (but very useful) radar-like system called Lidar for depth perception and obstacle detection (as well as cameras for seeing the colour of traffic lights and signs), AImotive is trying to do the same using regular cameras combined with artificial intelligence. This means the company can convert a regular car into a driverless one for a fraction of the price – around $6,000 – as opposed to $70,000-$100,000.  Popular Searches Full House Resorts Inc FLL ▼ 2.24 -0.04 -1.75% SembCorp Marine Ltd SMBMY ▲ 10.21 +0.06 +0.54% CBL & Associates Properties Inc CBL ▼ 9.97 -0.26 -2.54% Ascena Retail Group Inc ASNA ▲ 4.50 +0.06 +1.35% “The whole traffic system is based on the visual system,” explained founder and CEO Laszlo Kishonti. “Drivers don’t have bat ears and sonars, you just look around and drive.”  AImotive, founded in 2015, wants to replicate that human ability. “The only way to do this is with AI.” The car features four fish-eye cameras, covering each side of the vehicle, as well as dual stereo cameras facing forward and backward. The trunk of the car is filled with a chunky, power-intensive PC that stitches feeds from the cameras – the “eyes” of the car – together in real time to create a three-dimensional model of the environment. Artificial intelligence is applied to the video feeds to make sense of the surrounding environment, so the system understands what’s around the car and at what distance. Is the object a human, a car, a cat, a road or a sidewalk? If it’s a human or animal, where are they going? Are they about to stop? Or run across the road? These are relatively simple tasks for humans, but challenging for computers faced with frames of pixels. In a test drive around Mountain View, the Guardian got to see through the many different eyes of the machine, watching it map distances and objects in real time. The car’s live view is combined with a GPS-type “location engine” that places the vehicle on a map. AI also powers the “motion engine” which plots the vehicle’s driving path on the road, and this is fed into a “control engine” which informs the steering, braking and acceleration of the car. Unfortunately, AImotive has yet to get its California driverless car licence, so the Prius was controlled by a human for our 10-minute ride. However the fully autonomous function has been tested on the roads and underground car parks in Budapest, where AImotive is headquartered. Lidar became the standard sensing technology for autonomous vehicles after cars fitted with the technology did well in DARPA’s driverless car competition a decade ago, Kishonti said. By launching in 2015, AImotive hit a sweet spot in artificial intelligence and computer vision. “The speed of research in the field has been remarkable,” said COO Niko Eiden. The drawback of a vision-based system rather than a Lidar system is that it’s limited by what it can see – just like humans. This means performance is poorer when there’s fog or snow. On the flip-side, in theory Almotive’s approach is more flexible and the car could be dropped into any city and know what to do – without previously creating a detailed 3D map of the roads as a reference point. This should mean that AImotive’s cars can handle unpredictable changes to the route, for example when roadworks redirect traffic onto the “wrong” side of the road. “Every day there’s a temporary traffic sign somewhere, what does the first car that sees that do?” asks Kishonti. The AImotive team uses a more extreme scenario as a thought experiment: “What if an elephant escapes from the circus?” It doesn’t matter how many times a car drives round Mountain View, it’s not going to be able to account for these types of “black swan” events. “We would recognise it as a big mass of body, but probably would not be able to forecast what this animal will do,” admitted Kishonti. To teach the system how to handle extreme conditions, AImotive uses a simulator to drive millions and millions of virtual miles to see how its car reacts in a wide range of driving conditions and interactions with other cars, people and animals. “You can go to Scandinavia and see snow but there’s no New York in Scandinavia. How do you test all types of traffic with snow?” asks Kishonti. With simulations, that’s how. AImotive doesn’t have any plans to build its own cars from scratch, but is working with companies like Volvo to provide the self-driving “brains” of cars and trucks. Like Otto, the truck automation company that Uber recently acquired (and is currently the target of a major lawsuit over allegedly stealing trade secrets from Waymo), AImotive believes that the trucking industry is ripe for automation. “Trucking companies are competing for 1-2% price difference, but 60% of the cost is the driver,” said Kishonti. However, he recognizes that there are political hurdles over and above the technical ones.  “Trucking companies would be happy if the drivers could be eliminated but the trade unions will have different ideas,” he said. In the meantime, AImotive can provide truck companies with safety features, such as detecting cyclists in drivers’ blind spots. For now, the company is focused on getting the licence to drive its cars legally in California and then Nevada. Once the paperwork’s in place it will launch a highway pilot “in a few months” before experimenting in urban settings in early 2018.

It goes without saying that this is an impressive number. Furthermore, with so many downloads and such a high rating, it is safe to say that this app is nothing short of great. To explain, 4Shared is basically a huge database in which everything, all files, are shared by its users.

Also read: Watch free movies online Spotify Music Perhaps the most popular music-related programme in the world, Spotify has its own app form. Everyone has at least heard of Spotify, and millions of people across the globe use it as their go-to software for free music. The best part is, although it is technically a radio-streaming programme, you have complete control over what you want to listen to, unlike actual radio. SPOTIFY I personally use Spotify myself, and the reason is due to not just its huge wealth of great music, but because it is also legal and it contributes somewhat financially to the actual music artists. All things considered, this popular radio-streaming giant offers an incredible amount of free music. There are intermittent ads, but this doesn’t detract from Spotify’s quality and wealth of free, great music. Google Play Music This app, designed by Google, is essentially a free radio service.

With this app, you get “A YouTube built just for music”. Basically, this form of YouTube cuts out the non-music videos, leaving you with only the music. There are ads just like the actual website, but it’s worth the short ads to use this great app. With this app you can also create personalised stations which will adapt to your likes over time.

You can now download the Napster app for your phone and receive its free, great music, just like it once provided. Unlike most music-related apps and players, Napster has no irritating ads. Furthermore, you can listen to your music offline. Basically, with Napster, you can listen to your favourite playlist when travelling to work, without being interrupted by ads. Finally, the Napster app at the moment has been downloaded around 70,000 times. All things considered, although Napster is back in a new way, it still greatly delivers like its old ways.

Rock My Run Are you perhaps interested in fitness? Does your week consist of regular workouts? If so, Rock My Run has been specifically designed for you. This app is manufactured for those who love to listen to music during workouts. Some of the best features about this app is that you can create some unique playlists. For example, you can make playlists which are moulded around a certain tempo or mood. If you wanted to create a fast playlist for running, for example, or an inspiring playlist for hill climbing, Rock My Run is the app for you. All in all, this app will certainly motivate you in the gym or in the great outdoors. ROckmyrun is an amazing free music app for fitness training app. You can hear your favourite music while running, jogging or exercising. You can hear some popular DJ’s with perfect beats for training. It will increase your confidence and enthusiasm and will motivate you to keep going. You just need to choose your favourite genre and then it will stream body driven music. I would really prefer his app as I am personally a sportsperson. Rock My Run Has been rated 4.3 stars which is amazing. Got 1 million+ downloads. Size is quite big. Finally, it’s size is 32 MB. It seems like it requires android version 4.0 or up. Furthermore, it even consumes fewer data. In conclusion, it is one of the best free music apps for android. Gaana This app is one of the most popular music apps for Hindi, Bollywood, Punjabi and other similar types of music. Most popular in India, Gaana also offers free streaming service for popular songs in English, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, and Malayalam. You can also browse through the charts and select your favourite tracks to listen to or place in your own personalised playlist. There are heaps of playlists on offer, ranging from collections of sad ballads to weekend party hits. Ganna: Music Ultimately, Gaana brings the best of India to your mobile phone, whilst also delivering some popular hits from the likes of David Guetta, Bruno Mars, and more. There are a recorded 10 million music tracks to choose from, as well as thousands of playlists. At present, Gaana has been downloaded more than 800,000 times according to Google Play. SoundCloud SoundCloud is a unique music programme used by millions of people and musicians for self-production. In other words, with SoundCloud, musicians everywhere are using this free platform to upload their music. Musicians everywhere are joining this free programme, and listeners everywhere likewise are tuning in to hear what common everyday people are producing. Once a music file is uploaded to SoundCloud, people from all over the world can tune in and listen to it for free. With SoundCloud, you can be either a listener or a giver of music, or both. Soundcloud is great music downloader free app. A lot of features. The enormous database of mp3 songs. Download your favourite music tracks or songs quickly from this app. Connect and share with your friend. Entirely ads free. Finally, you can download this Android app from the below link. It is an editor’s choice music downloader free app for Android. Furthermore, it has been downloaded billions of times. Sound Cloud Since it has been rated four stars, it is an amazing free mp3 download app for android. It seems like it requires Android 4.0 or up. It was last updated in June 2016. Furthermore, this free mp3 music downloader app was developed in Germany by SoundCloud. Finally, it is a fantastic music downloader free app for Android. I personally have many friends who record and upload their own music onto SoundCloud. The benefits of using SoundCloud is the fact that you can listen to undiscovered talent which the radio cannot deliver. You can listen to friends or upcoming breakthrough artists, before the music companies slap a copyright on the tracks. Of course, you won’t find top 50 artists through SoundCloud. This is why it doesn’t rank as highly on my list. Nonetheless, there is great music out there besides the popstars on the radio. Why not give it a try and perhaps you will find a local musician whose music you could love. Saavn Music & Radio Another Hindi-related app for free music downloads, Saavn is in contention for the best app for Bollywood music. Personally, I believe Gaana is a bit better, but Saavn nonetheless shouldn’t be ignored. Saavn gives pretty much everything that Gaana does, but there are some differences between the two apps. For example, with Saavn, you can also enjoy podcasts and audio programmes. By following your favourite artists, you will be notified when/if there are any updates. Saavn In addition, with Saavn you can listen to your favourite songs offline. Playlists are also in your control to create and then modify. Like Gaana, you still get the array of different music, from English to Bollywood, Hindi to Tamil. Saavn Music & Radio is proving to be quite popular, with around 750,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play site. MP3 Music Download An app as simple and effective as its title suggests, MP3 Music Downloader may not be as popular as the rest of these apps for free music downloads, but it certainly contends well. With this app, you have unlimited access to a bunch of music files, as well as unlimited music downloads. It’s all very simple with this app. Just search for the song, artist or genre you have in mind, let the app work its magic, and then begin your download. Download App You can alternatively just stream the track if you prefer. Ultimately, this app is one of the most basic music-related apps out there on the market. It has been downloaded only 8,356 times at present, but around 50% of users have rated the app a full 5 stars out of 5. Other Great Free Music Download Apps That Almost Made the Cut Apple Music From the mega power of Apple Music comes this useful app. There are approximately 30 million Apple tracks available to listen to through this app. However, I must declare early that this app is not completely free. On the other hand, if you subscribe you can use it for free for 3 months. The fact that Apple Music is not free has dropped it out of my personal top 10 apps for free music downloads. If it weren’t for this hick-up, however, Apple Music would have a fair shot at one of the highest positions on the top 10. There are thousands of playlists to go along with the huge library of 30 million Apple songs. You can create your own library of your favourite songs. Apple Music also offers regular recommendations depending on what you listen to. There are also radio stations and other audio programmes to delve within. Basically, if you don’t want to spend a penny, you can only have this app for a limited time. The Apple Music app currently holds an overall rating of 3.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Shazam I wrestled with myself for quite some time on where to put Shazam on this list. This app fully deserves a top 10 place, and 2 million people on Google Play would probably agree with that. At the present moment, Shazam has been downloaded almost 3 million times. Of these downloaders, around two-thirds of them have given Shazam the full 5 out of 5 rating. Another half a million have given the app a 4 star rating. Shazam has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Besides these highly impressive statistics, what does Shazam have to say about itself? Apparently, top singers and celebrities like Adele and Demi Lovato are using the app for their own free music downloads. Some of the top features include: access to lyrics, identify music offline, add songs onto Spotify playlists from Shazam, and more. Shazam also uses amazing visual recognition scanning. This means if you see an album cover or poster, for example, which you want to know more about, use Shazam to scan it and the app will collect information about the music artist in question. There are many other little features which make Shazam a great free app to have. I highly recommend giving it a try, despite the fact that it has just slipped outside the top 10. Vevo In recent years, the Vevo corporation have placed their stamp on many of the biggest, most viewed music videos. Vevo is the result of the partnership between two of the giants of music distrubution: Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. From this we now have Vevo, the now-popular music video hosting service. So, what can their app do for you? This app as you may have already figured is focused solely on music videos. Due to the fact that this app deals with videos only, and not specifically free music download, it has thus crept out of the top 10 spot. With Vevo, you can watch your favourite music videos in HD and create playlists of the videos you like most. You can also favourite artists, and when a new music video is released by your favourited artist you will be notified. However, Vevo is only available in a select number of countries. The Vevo app is available in the following countries: Canada, USA, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and New Zealand. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 on Google Play. TuneIn Radio One of the most popular radio apps, TuneIn Radio offers an impressive 10,000 different radio stations for free. As a radio station app, it has thus fallen out of my top 10 apps for free music downloads. In addition to all this great music, you can also tune into the news, sports and weather broadcasts, as well as other radio programmes. With TuneIn Radio you can keep track of college basketball, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL. All of the radio is delivered live from the very sources. Therefore, you won’t be in complete control over what music artist or song you want to listen to. Nonetheless, you can choose a specific radio station out the thousands of quality stations on offer. Basically, TuneIn Radio sources thousands of top quality radio stations into one single app. There is an abundance of stations to choose from. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Tidal This app combines high quality definition, high definition music videos, as well as valued information from music journalists. There are huge amounts of music on offer with Tidal. The app claims to offer over 40 million tracks, as well as more than 130,000 high definition music videos. As for the contributing journalists, you can try out the carefully selected playlists chosen by these musical experts. You can also read the well-crafted articles, recommendations and interviews provided by these music journalists. In addition to all this, there are no ads nor any ‘fuzzy images’. There is also an offline mode, which allows you to listen to your albums and playlists when you are out and about. The Tidal app currently holds an overall rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Google Play based on 38,653 votes. Heart Radio Again another radio app, Heart radio is a popular radio station situated in the UK. The app is plain and simple. This app is the official app of Heart Radio and thus brings the station to your device. With the app, you can also see what songs are playing next, re-listen to songs from the past week, view the top trending videos, get celebrity news, and more. Of course, this app isn’t exactly an app for free music downloads, hence why I haven’t included it in my top 10. It is, however, a good radio station nonetheless. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play. Qello Concerts This app is quite unique. With Qello Converts, you can stream classic concerts and documentaries. This app is essentially a treasure chest full of old great live concerts which you can replay at any time. Some of the things which this app also provides are: One of more free tracks from each concert, more than 30 channels of continuous concert moments, and special free full-length shows. It may not be an app for free music downloads, but is is however an app for free music concert downloads. In addition, there are a whole bunch of award-winning music documentaries to feast your eyes and ears on. Qello Concerts currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play based on 23,233 user votes. Pandora Radio Unlike most radio apps, Pandora gives you complete control over what you want to listen to. With Pandora music, you can create individual stations or playlists for your favourite artists. Most Pandora apps allow you to store up to 100 different artist playlists. Once you have an artist playlist, you will be given anything by that artist on demand. Like I said, Pandora lets you create your own unique radio channels. Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandora, and it almost made its way into my top 10 favourite apps for free music downloads. You can upgrade to Pandora Plus, which will cut the ads, allow replays and skips, and offline playing. The Pandora Radio app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on an impressive number of 2,651,882 user votes. I highly recommend this app, despite the fact I haven’t included it in my top 10. SongFlip The SongFlip app claims to offer its users the ability to stream millions of free songs online. I am unsure if there is actually millions on offer from SongFlip, but it does nonetheless offer a lot. The SongFlip app is one of the most basic apps for free music downloads. Simply search for your song or artist and begin streaming for free. There is a high chance that SongFlip has the exact song or artist that you have in mind. After all, it does claim to have millions of tracks to give. The SongFlip app currently holds an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Google Play. Radio Player by Audials This app, yet another radio app, offers over 80,000 different radio stations across the USA. Simply search for an artist, a genre, song or album, and Audials will do its best to retrieve a station best suited to your search. In addition, you can record songs playing on any radio. In other words, if you hear a song which you happen to like but you don’t know the name of, you can choose to record the song right there and then. You can also connect your device to another computer belonging to you, thus allowing you to sync the selected music onto your home PC or laptop. The Radio Player by Audials app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on 19,49 user votes. Radio Online – PCRADIO You’ve probably assumed by now that there are thousands of radio-related music apps. That assertion would be correct. However, Radio Online – PCRADIO is one of the best free radio apps out there, and the following is why. This app offers hundreds of free radio stations, which is not as many as the thousands offered by the above Radio Player by Audials, or, TuneIn Radio, for example. Nonetheless, Radio Online PCRADIO does have its own perks. With this app, you can use it even if you do have the lowest of internet speeds. Also, all the radio channels are categorised by artist and genre, making your searches easy. Furthermore, Radio Online PCRADIO also offers full discographies on several artists. The Radio Online PCRADIO app currently holds an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Google Play based on 645,547 user votes. Other Great Music Downloader Apps For Free Music Downloads, and Apps Similar To Music Streaming The following apps are other apps for free music downloads. In addition there are some apps which are not quite designed to download free music. Some play music like many of the aforementioned apps and some are more unique in what they offer. SoundHound Picture yourself listening to a song, you don’t know who it’s by, and you have no way of finding out the artist. Well, these days we have SoundHound to do that for us. SoundHound can recognise voice clips, which will then generate heaps of results. You can save all your searches and import your findings into your Spotify account. The app comes with an embedded YouTube player so you can watch the music video of the found song (if there is one). You can also view the lyrics to the found song, or, if you wish, SoundHound will direct you to where you can purchase the track. There is also an abundance of information on numerous music artists to browse through. All this sounds great, but there is one snag. One version of SoundHound on the Google Play website is unfortunately not free ($3.99). On the other hand, there is another SoundHound app which is practically the exact same which is free. At the moment, I am trying to differentiate between the two apps and figure out if there is any difference. However, I can’t see any major differences, or a single difference at all. In short, search for the free version of SoundHound. This app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website based on 623,731 user votes. Deezer – Songs & Music Player Deezer does everything that a good music app should do. One of the best features used on this app is called ‘Flow’.. Flow will suggest music based on your listening habits. You can also play unlimited playlists, tune into the radio and catch up on the news or sports, create your own playlists, and generally listen to some of the world’s leading musical icons. The Deezer app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on the Google Play website. blinkbox Music A very basic app, blinkbox Music is an app specifically for android users. The app itself offers the essentials, such as unlimited streaming and a ton of free and popular hits. You can tune into top 40 playlists and other great additions. The blinkbox Music app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on the Google Play website.

You can create and edit your own individual homepage, share playlists with friends and use the privacy settings. YOUZEEK is available in over 200 countries.

The Torch music app currently holds and overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on the google Play website. New Releases Ed Sheeran – Shape Of You Currently storming the charts across the world is the young English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran. After a few years from his last album release, Sheeran is back from a brief break to release his new album, Divide. In the event of its release, Ed has given us two songs from his newest album, Castle on the Hill and Shape of You. Shape Of You is currently number 1 in the UK as well as other countries, and is the perfect track to ‘get down to’ in the clubs (if you haven’t already). Chainsmokers – Paris The Chainsmokers are the biggest DJ act to appear from the music scene within the past year or so, and their most recent single Paris is storming the charts. In recent weeks, these guys have produced big hits like Closer and Don’t Let Me Down. Paris has that same vibe, which has thus placed the track highly on the official charts throughout the world. The song has the same elements has other big tracks, which will make it an essentially tune on any weekend playlist. Rag’n’Bone Man – Human This rising artist is from England, and his most recent song Human is not only taking the UK charts by storm, but it also reached no.1 in several other European countries. Rag’n’Bone Man is certainly a name to remember for the future. To put a name on the genre, I would classify the song itself as Soul track with a modern touch of R & B.  This song may very well top the charts in the next few weeks, so get listening now. I Don’t Wanna Live Forever – ZAYN & Taylor Swift Zayn Malik of One Direction and pop super queen Taylor Swift have banded together to produce this song for the official Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack. The movie is set to release this week in cinemas worldwide, which should hopefully boost the song further up the charts. The song itself is well suited for the love and romance projected in the movie, so if you want some music for the upcoming Valentine’s day celebrations, this song may very well become part of your soundtrack. Little Mix – Touch Since appearing on the popular TV show The X Factor a few years back, Little Mix have gone from strength to strength. Their newest album has done quite well in the charts, and their new single, Touch, currently sits comfortably at no.4 on the UK top 40 charts. Touch blends the band’s nice girlband vocals with R & B vibes that have made them successful with earlier tracks, such as Shout Out To My Ex. Martin Garix & Dua Lippa – Scare To Be Lonely The world recognised Dj and producer, Martin Garrix teams up with female vocalist, Dua Lippa, for this big club mix. Scared To Be Lonely follows Garrix’s previous dance flavours, with big drops and catchy melodies sure to earn a place in your weekend playlist, and certain to get you pumped for the weekend parties. Stormzy – Big For Your Boots One of the biggest success stories to emerge from the London grime scene this year is Stormzy. It’s been 9 months since his last single, and now, his new single Big For Your Boots has climbed its way up the UK charts at no.8. The song is another great analysis of the working class London way of life. If you are a fan of British rap, Stormzy is an absolute must. James Arthur – Say You Won’t Let Go This young man won the coveted X Factor competition and disappeared into the shadow. Nothing was heard of James Arthur until this big single was unleashed, which shot its way up the charts. This, his first no. 1 single, is an acoustic ballad with simple love lyrics, sure to calm the heart of any romantically-seeking individual. He should be back with more similar music in the future, so keep an ear on him for the time being. Nick Jonas & Nicki Minaj – Bom Bidi Bom With the release of the new installment of the Fifty Shades franchise, Fifty Shades Darker, also comes a hot new soundtrack. Minaj and Nick Jonas from the hugely successful Jonas Brothers have teamed up to feature on the movie’s racy soundtrack. The track itself, Bom Bidi Bom, much like the movie it features on, is sure to get pulses racing and bodies moving. Ed Sheeran – How Would You Feel (Paean) Continuing from the upcoming release of his new album, Divide ÷ , Ed has just dropped yet another new single destined to do very well in the charts. The newest single, How Would You Feel (Paean) follows the same romantic vein as previous songs like Thinking Out Loud and Tenerife Sea. The song evokes the same nostalgic romances, sun rises and heartbreak which define some of Sheeran’s most popular songs. Jax Jones – You Don’t Know Me ft. RAYE Currently sitting nicely at no.4 on the UK top 40 charts is You Don’t Know Me by British DJ and producer Jax Jones, with RAYE on vocals. The track is inspired by the likes of Justin Timberlake and most other popular pop dance tracks that have dominated the charts these past few years. The song is perfect for uplifting the weekend party, setting a nice light dance atmosphere without going over the top. Dua Lipa – Be the One One artist who has really broken onto the music scene with great success recently is the beautiful singer, Dua Lipa. The singer has previously provided vocals for other chart hits, such as Scared To Be Alone by Martin Garrix, and You Don’t Know Me by Jax Jones. Dua Lipa indeed has her own material, and this upbeat track is doing quite well in the charts. She is really one to watch for the upcoming musical year and beyond. Kygo & Selena Gomez – It Ain’t Me Pop princess Selena Gomez is back with a new track set to become a big hit. The song is another tale of hardship in a relationship, and although the track has a romantic attitude, Kygo is featured to deliver the dance vibes which make it the perfect track to get your groove on. It Ain’t Me is ultimately a great blend of ballad and beat, passion and pulse, love and vibe. Lana Del Rey – Love After her hiatus, Lana Del Rey is finally back and throwing out the big tunes. Her latest track, Love, features her trademark ethereal atmospheres, smooth vocals and tender themes. Love is a passionate track which echoes the nature of her first big hits, such as Born To Die, Summertime Sadness and Video Games. Fans of her music are sure to ‘love’ her new track. Sam Hunt – Body Like A Back Road Sam Hunt, a new name that launched from the American country scene just over 2 years ago, has released an interesting mix of country and pop. The singer holds onto his country roots with the slide guitar, organ and other elements, and meshed it with a cool beat. If you’re not a fan of country music, Body Like A Back Road might make all this change for you. The Weeknd & Daft Punk – Starboy Popular rap act The Weeknd teams up with the legendary DJ duo, Daft Punk for this big track. Daft Punk provide the solid beats for The Weeknd’s flow, creating a great mix of rhythm and attitude in Starboy. This track is on route to joining another hit for The Weeknd, which is not surprising considering Daft Punk are behind the creation. Drake – Fake Love American rapper, Drake is back releasing big hits. The Online Bling singer’s new track, Fake Love, is another mastery of R & B and a solid lyrical flow. Fake Love deals with superficial relationships, and features a good beat along with some nice melodies. If you’re a fan of Drake’s music, this track is a must. Maroon 5 – Cold Adam Levine and co. are still going strong in their latest offering, Cold. The high tempo track features some house elements, along with Levine’s trademark alto voice. Cold is ultimately about a failing relationship. In addition, rapper, Future, also provides a flowing rap and some extra vocals mid-track to mix things up, creating a mesh of pop and R & B elements. Coldplay & The Chainsmokers – Something Just Like This Two of the world’s leading musical acts have teamed up to produce something quite special. The ethereal harmonies and progressions of Coldplay have beautifully meshed with the vibes and feel-good pulses of the The Chainsmokers. Something Just Like This will soon dominate radio stations and the charts everywhere, I’m almost sure of it. Calvin Harris – Slide World-recognised DJ superstar Calvin Harris is back with the big tunes. His latest single, Slide, features the good old savvy beats and rhythms that previously made the DJ such a big success. Slide has a hint of 80s funk, blended with some smooth male rap-inspired vocals and the essential big drops that’ll surely get you grooving. Imagine Dragons – Shot Imagine Dragons have enjoyed worldwide success over the past few years, and its for good reason that the American band are so popular. Their latest track, Shot, is filled with their trademark feel-good blend of pop, rock and dance. With a touch of electric guitars, blended with some synths and some strong vocals, Shot is a euphoric song that all fans of the band will surely enjoy. Katy Perry – Chained To the Rhythm Katy Perry has never really stepped out of the spotlight since her first single, I Kissed A Girl shot to no.1 all those years ago. These days the singer is back on the radio with her popular single Chained To the Rhythm. This song is doing quite well in the charts, with its catchy melodies and his forceful rhythm, it’s sure to be another pop hit for the American singer. Willie Nelson – A Woman’s Love The Red Headed Stranger is still going strong, as is evident in his most recent single, A Woman’s Love. For fan’s of Nelson and country in general, this track will be a joy. A Woman’s Love returns to the country roots of a vocalist spurned by love, accompanied by a wailing harmonica and the rest of Willie’s ingredients which open up the vistas of the western dusty roads in the mind’s eye. Rag’n’Bone Man – Skin Perhaps the biggest music star to emerge from nowhere these past few weeks is Rag’n’Bone man. His track ‘Human’ erupted onto the charts and catapulted the young singers name into the uppermost ranks of the musical world. The hits keep on coming with this man; Skin is set to also do very well in the charts. It features that similar gospel, R & B vibe that is inherent in his other tracks. This man is certainly a talent to keep an ear on. Coldplay – Hypnotised Coldplay are back, but then again, due their huge success as a band over the years, have they ever really left? Their most recent single, Hypnotised, is a continuation of their soft pop/rock sound, with a dreamy mix of piano, hypnotic guitars and Chris Martin’s high vocals. Although a new album hasn’t been scheduled for the band, I sense that a new album is in the works and coming soon. Ed Sheeran – Perfect The 25 year old pop superstar has just brought out his much anticipated new album, Divide, and the songs are proving to be big hits. Following the release of Shape of You and Castle On the Hill, two huge hits, Sheeran’s new song Perfect is another romantic hit dedicated to the new love of his life. Perfect is as romantic as it gets, and this ballad should certainly do very well in the charts over the next few weeks. Meghan Trainor – I’m A Lady Pop princess Meghan Trainor returns with another big track sure to empower ladies across the world. The singer secured some pretty big hits last year, and the big tunes keep coming from this one. I’m A Lady has hints of Beyonce, with some techno drops, R & B sazzle and powerful vocals. This song should do well in the tracks, if her past songs are anything to go by.

For example, mp3 is perhaps the most common file type for music downloads. Mp3 files can be used in almost any music playing software programme, like iTunes or Windows Media Player.

It’s great and I love it, but the app is being discontinued and I need a replacement. Any ideas? WorldMate, an itinerary-management tool for travellers that has been around since 2000, recently announced it was closing down. As the company explained, the WorldMate app will be removed from the Apple, Google and Windows app stores on March 31. While the paid Gold version of the app will maintain most functions like calendar sync and flight notifications after the app is removed, that service itself will be retired on September 30. In addition to providing tools like flight search, price alerts and currency converters, WorldMate allows users to forward email confirmations for flight, hotel, car rental and other travel-related receipts to the service. It then combined all the information into one spot, creating a handy trip itinerary with all the details. However, WorldMate was not the only travel app to do so and several alternatives exist that work in a similar way. TripIt has many of the same basic features as WorldMate and has mobile apps for Android, BlackBerry, iOS and Windows Phone (along with many positive reviews). The free version syncs and shares your travel information in one place, but the TripIt Pro edition ($49 a year) adds real-time flight alerts, seat-upgrade notifications and other perks. TripCase is another well-reviewed free itinerary manager with similar tools for Android and iOS devices; it also has integration with the Alexa assistant on the Amazon Echo line of speakers. And for those immersed in the Google ecosystem, the free Google Trips travel planner for Android and iOS automatically creates itineraries by pulling in confirmations sent to Gmail accounts. Q: I use the mail program that came with Windows 10 and I notice that at the bottom of every message I send, the program sticks in a line that says ‘Sent from Mail for Windows 10.’ How do I get rid of that? As with other mail programs, if you have not added a customised signature in the settings, the Mail for Windows 10 program inserts a default line at the bottom of each message — in this case, one that advertises the name of your email app. To lose this generic sentence appended to your outgoing messages, you can replace it with the text of your choice or turn off the signature feature altogether. To take either action, open the Mail app on your PC and select the gear-shaped Settings icon on the bottom-left corner of the windows. When the Settings pane appears on the right side of the Mail windows, select Signature from the list. At the bottom of the Signature setting screen, you can replace the boilerplate ‘Sent from Mail for Windows 10’ line with more personal text, like your name and contact information, a favourite quote, a disclaimer or anything else that comes to mind. If you use multiple accounts with the Mail app, you can include the signature with all of them by turning on the ‘Apply to all accounts’ option at the top of the settings box. The Windows 10 Mail app does not allow you to change the font or font colour in your signature file, nor can you insert images or web links. If you would rather skip the signature at the bottom of your messages, change the button from On to Off in the ‘Use an email signature’ section of the settings box. Mac users can add signatures to outgoing messages in Apple’s built-in Mail app. Open the programme, go to the Mail menu and choose Signatures to get to the settings.   Tweet Go to Top Videos Congress, SP, BSP have different culture of...

Find out how to get, activate and start using the new digital assistant, here.   Almost a year after it was first unveiled, Google has finally begun a widespread rollout of its own AI-powered virtual assistant. Following it the footsteps of popular virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa and Cortana, Google Assistant brings a digital helper of its own to Android users across the globe.   The feature, which was first showcased at Google I/O last spring, was initially made available only to Google Pixel phone users, but as of this week, Google announced that many more Android users will be enjoying Google Assistant. The feature began rolling out to Nougat and Marshmallow devices the week of February 26 and continues to become available to more users every day. If you have an Android device and want to get Google Assistant working on it but aren’t sure how, we’ve put together a comprehensive guide of everything you need to know to activate and begin using Google Assistant on your device. Google Assistant Update Release: How To Get, Activate And Start Using Google’s New Virtual Assistant google assistant how to get use activate google assistant update google play service start google assistant pixel android smartphones compatible download apk instructionsMore Google's virtual assistant has begun rolling out to more users this week. Find out if your device is compatible. Photo: Google Which Devices Are Compatible With Google Assistant? So before you try to grab Google Assistant, the first thing you need to check is if your device is compatible. Google Assistant has been available on Google Pixel Phone since its release, but this week, Google has begun rolling out the AI helper to Android phones running Android 7.0 Nougat and 6.0 Marshmallow. While there is no official listing of phones that will be compatible with the update, here are a few popular devices that should receive it: HTC 10 HTC U Ultra Huawei P9 LG G5 LG V20 Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Sony Xperia XZ Which Countries Will Receive The Google Assistant Update? Unfortunately, Google Assistant won’t be available to users in every country. The update will release to users in the U.S. first and then will roll out to users in the UK, Australia, Canada and Germany. Android users outside of these countries will not have access to the update.  How Do I Get And Activate Google Assistant? If you know your device is compatible then getting the Google Assistant is pretty simple. All that is required is to update your device’s Google Play Services. Keep in mind, though, Google Assistant is rolling out slowly, so not everyone with a compaatible device in a country where the rollout is taking place will have access to it right away. If your Google Play Service is updated but Google Assistant still isn't available to you, it likely hasn't rolled out in your area yet. Just keep checking on it each day. How Do I Update Google Play Services? Updating Google Play Services is fairly simple but not exactly intuitive. Here are steps to follow for getting and updating Google Play Services on your Android phone. Get the latest Google Play Services APK and download it on your device. You can find a full listing of these, here. Find the APK your downloaded, and copy it to your device’s internal/external storage. Go to Settings > Security > Unknown Sources and check the box that allows 3rd-party application installation. Now find where you saved the APK on your device and open up the installation screen. Tap on the install button and the update will begin. Once the app is finished updating, Google Assistant should be ready to go! How To Check If Google Assistant Is Installed google assistant how to get use activate google assistant update google play service start google assistant pixel android smartphones compatible download apk instructionsMore Read More Activating Google Assistant simply requires long pressing the home button or saying "Ok, Google." Photo: Google If Google Assistant has rolled out in our area, and Google Play Services have updated properly, Google Assistant should be ready to go. To activate Google assistant and start using it, simply long press on the home button. You’ll be introduced to Google Assistant and asked to allow some permissions so that it can work. Once you’ve finished, Google Assistant is ready to use.  Tips And Tricks For Starting And Using Google Assistant google assistant how to get use activate google assistant update google play service start google assistant pixel android smartphones compatible download apk instructionsMore You can ask Google Assistant to help with lots of things. The new virtual AI is designed to understand natural language. Photo: Google Once you know Google Assistant is installed, you are now ready to start using it. To activate Google Assistant either long press on the home button or say the magic words, “Ok, Google.” Google Assistant will pop up on the screen with a “Hi, how can I help you” message. If you are new to using a virtual assistant, you might feel a little silly talking to it. Don’t worry, though: New AI helpers like Google Assistant have been designed to recognize natural language, so just ask questions the way you would to a friend. On the Google Assistant’s support page, the company actually offers a few suggestions for things you can ask your new smartphone helper. Here’s a small sample: What's the weather today? What's will the weather be this weekend? What restaurants are nearby? I feel like having pizza tonight. Where's the closest gas station? Which pharmacy is open? How long will it take to get to the airport? Show me my schedule for tomorrow. Set an alarm for 6 a.m. Show me my photos of the beach.

Rather, the self-driving space is left to contend with legal hurdles, in addition to the likes of technological and regulatory issues. It is currently speculated that the earliest self-driving ventures could come to fruition is 2020. With the legal monkey on its back, will the schedule be pushed back? Technology Companies Give Up Go-Alone Approach After high profile launches, with the promise to commercialize self-driving cars, tech companies such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) have slowly and steadily realized the challenges to diversify into hardware. After Google spun off its self-driving venture into a standalone company called Waymo, it has signaled that it will stick to its strength of supplying the technological expertise, while leaving the hardware part to traditional automakers. Related Link: Automakers Eye The Finish Line in Sprint To Rollout Driverless Vehicles Confidentiality Breached These companies are now facing challenges from unexpected quarters. A few of them have initiated legal proceedings, alleging theft of intellectual property, specifically by former employees, who breached confidentiality clause. Google's ‘Et Tu, Brute' Moment Google's Waymo filed a lawsuit in a California federal court last Thursday, alleging that Anthony Levandowski, a former manager at Waymo had downloaded more than 14,000 proprietary and confidential files, including the lidar, Light Detection and Ranging, circuit board. Levandowski quit Google in January 2016 and later formed Otto LLC in May 2016 — a company intended to develop hardware and software for autonomous vehicles. Otto was subsequently acquired by Uber Technologies for $680 million. Waymo's lawsuit alleges unfair competition, patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation. "Instead, Otto and Uber have taken Waymo's intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology," Waymo said in the complaint. The lawsuit doesn't look like without merit, as Waymo took seven years to design the lidar circuit board, while Uber reportedly did it in nine months. Google was also involved in another lawsuit, which it filed last December, against a former employee for breaching the contractual obligations concerning possession and use of confidential information, when he went on to work for a start-up called Drive.ai. Tesla Also In Legal Tangle Meanwhile, in a separate development, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) has sued its former autopilot director. In a lawsuit filed with the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara, the case reads in part, "This dispute arises out of the efforts of [redacted] [...] to violate his contractual and other obligations to Tesla by attempting to recruit at least a dozen Tesla engineers, taking Tesla's confidential and proprietary information, and doctoring and destroying evidence in an effort to cover his tracks — all for the benefit of a competing venture he launched while still a Tesla employee." The formal complaints raised in the case, however, are verbatim: Breach of contract. Breach of duty of loyalty. Aiding and abetting breach of duty of loyalty. Intentional interference with contractual relations. Intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. Violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. With huge stakes involved in IP, it is not without rhyme and reason, these technology giants have opted to fight it out in the courts.

Gadget Hacks Android Hacks WonderHowTo Gadget Hacks Next Reality Invisiverse Driverless Null Byte Android Basics Glossary of Terms Galaxy S8 Rumors HTC 11 Rumors Everything Pixel Rooting Guide Gaming Roundups Forum Stay Secure How-Tos News How To: Google Actually Has 4 Different 'Assistants'—Here's the Best One for You By Dallas Thomas Fri 6:42 PM Google Actually Has 4 Different 'Assistants'—Here's the Best One for You The new Google Assistant is only officially available on three platforms—newer Android phones (Pixels and those running Marshmallow and Nougat), the Google Allo app, and Google Home. However, most of the Assistant's basic functionality is also bundled into the Google app for Android and iOS, which used to go by the name Google Now, but is now referred to only as Screen Search or your Google app's Feed. Counting the three official Google Assistant platforms and the Google app for Android and iOS, we now have a total of four different ways to interact with Google conversationally. Then, when you consider that all four of these "Assistants" have their own strengths and weaknesses, things start to get a little confusing. So to clarify, we reached out to Google's PR team and got a few answers, and we'll share those below while also explaining how Google Assistant works on each platform. Don't Miss: 10 Things Google Assistant Can Do to Make Your Life Easier The Four Googles Before we get into all of the finer differences between the various ways to interact with Google, let's take a second to define them all. Google Assistant: The voice-based Google Assistant that was previously only available on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, but is now rolling out to all phones with Marshmallow and Nougat. Google Home's Assistant: Another voice-based variant of the Google Assistant, which is only available if you purchase a Google Home smart speaker. Google Allo's Assistant: A text-based form of the Google Assistant that you can access by installing the Google Allo app for Android or iOS. Google app: What used to be called Google Now and Now on Tap. Instead, these features are now called Feed and Screen Search, respectively, and they're both included with the regular Google app for Android or iOS. The Google app's Feed shows you cards with relevant info before you perform a search, and the Screen Search feature lets you perform a quick Google search for keywords on the screen you're viewing (Android only). 1. Google Assistant First up, let's talk about the version available on Pixels, and phones running Marshmallow or Nougat. This one's probably the most confusing, because you've got voice-based interactions and text-based interactions right on the same home screen, which would lead you to believe that these are different ways to interact with the Assistant. But as the Google spokesperson we contacted put it, "There is only one Google Assistant." You see, the Google Assistant is only one part of the overall Google experience on Android: When you long-press your home button, you can speak to the Google Assistant from any screen. That's it. Short of installing Google Allo (more on that later), this is the only way to access Google Assistant on an Android device. The rest of the phone's Google features are all parts of the regular Google app. There's a widget on your home screen where you can type searches or dictate voice queries, but that offers the same experience you would get on any phone by installing the Google app. Don't Miss: How to Get Rid of Google Assistant on Your Pixel & Switch Back to Google Now There's a page on the left of your home screen that displays your Feed, showing you relevant information before you perform a search—but again, this is just an extension of the Google app. Makes sense, right? But there's one more wrinkle we need to address: The Google Assistant on newer Android devices has a slightly different set of features than the Google Assistant on other platforms. You can ask the it to send a message to one of your contacts, but this isn't possible with the Assistant on Google Home. Same goes for "Show me pictures of [x]." And unlike the other platforms, the Pixel's Assistant has Screen Search baked in, meaning you can scan your current screen for search keywords by swiping up after triggering the Assistant—but this is only possible because of the Google app integration on Android. To address these discrepancies, the Google spokesperson told us, "The goal of the Assistant is to provide the best results for the context in which you're interacting, so depending on the surface, you may get a slightly different result." Fair enough, but there are still some other minor differences between the various versions of Google and the Google Assistant. Verdict: Use the main Google Assistant if you want to go hands-free. The extra on-device features compared to Google Home give it the edge in voice command capabilities for now. 2. Allo's Assistant Another way to access the Google Assistant is by installing the Google Allo app for Android or iOS. It's a messaging service similar to WhatsApp, but with one neat trick up its sleeve—you can message the Google Assistant directly, as if it were one of your contacts. For the most part, Allo's Assistant behaves almost exactly like the Google Assistant on Android devices, except it's text-based rather than voice-based. Another difference is that there's no Google app integration, so when you're using Allo, you're only interacting with Google Assistant. This means there's no Screen Search or Feed, but it's an understandable omission, as the Google app can be downloaded separately if you want these features. Don't Miss: Google's New AI-Powered Allo App Makes Your Messages Smarter However, there are some things that Allo's Assistant can do which other Assistant platforms cannot. For instance, "Show me pictures of [x]" still works, even though it's not currently possible on Google Home. In addition to that, you can play an emoji-based guessing game with the Assistant on Allo, but this isn't an option on any of the other platforms. So we're starting to notice a trend here: The Google Assistant can have slightly different capabilities depending on how you access it. To expand on that concept, the Google spokesperson told us: An emoji game in Allo wouldn't work on the Assistant on Pixel because Pixel is voice-only, while Allo gives you the opportunity to type emoji responses. It's still very early days and by no means is the Assistant perfect on day 1, but our goal is to provide the more relevant result for your question. — Google Spokesperson Think of it this way: The Pixel and other Android phones being updated right now have a Google search widget on the home screen that you can type queries into, so there's no need for its Assistant to accept text input. However, with Allo, the whole point of the app is texting, so the Assistant only exists in a text-based form, which gives it a different set of strengths on this platform. Verdict: Use Allo's Assistant if you don't like talking to your phone. As it stands, Allo is the only platform where you can actually type to Google Assistant. 3. Google Home's Assistant To summarize what we've learned so far, you talk to the main Google Assistant, and write to Allo's Assistant, which gives you a slightly different experience on the two different platforms. But what about the Assistant that's baked into the Google Home smart speaker? Much like the main Google Assistant, this one can only be spoken to because there's no keyboard. But there's another hardware limitation that leads to a few more minor discrepancies—the Google Home doesn't have a display. For this reason, Google Home's Assistant doesn't know what to do when you ask it things like "Show me pictures of cats." But on the bright side, it also means that the Assistant in Google Home gets Google Cast capabilities. Don't Miss: 20 Google Home Easter Eggs & Fun Commands When you're setting up Google Home, you can add any Google Cast-compatible devices to your Assistant's repertoire, which includes Chromecast and Android TV. Once you've done that, you can ask the Assistant to "Show me cat videos on my TV," then the media will pop up on the external display. Sadly, this functionality is not available with Assistant in Allo, Pixel, or other Android phones being updated. But on the bright side, we asked Google about this issue, and it's one discrepancy that should actually get ironed out soon: We're working on bringing Cast functionality to the Assistant on Pixel soon. — Google Spokesperson Verdict: Use Google Home's Assistant if you're into controlling your TV, lights, and other home automation equipment. For now, it still has the edge on Pixel's Assistant when it comes to controlling external devices. 4. The Google App Finally, there's the regular old Google app, which is available for any smartphone, and supports both text and voice input simultaneously. It's what we used to call "Google Now," though its new name is simply "Google," with the additional Now features getting new labels: Google Now is no longer a product. ... [It] continues to live in Screen Search and the Google app on older Android devices. — Google Spokesperson Not mentioned there is the Google Feed, which is the list of cards underneath the search box in the Google app. Together, Google, Screen Search, and Feed make up a pretty formidable Google experience. The actual Google Assistant feature was said to remain exclusive to Google Home, Allo, and Pixel devices, as we were told before: We're starting with Pixel, we have no additional plans to share. — Google Spokesperson But Android devices running Marshmallow and Nougat with Google Play Services are being updated as we speak with Google Assistant! Older phones are still missing out, but several features, such as the Shazaam-like "What song is this?" voice command, the ability to share screenshots with Screen Search, and translating on-screen text, are not currently available on any of the Google Assistant platforms, so not getting Assistant may not be so bad for you. In fact, if you're not interested in Google Assistant's conversational attitude on Android, its text-based games in Allo, or the burgeoning smart home control features in Google Home, the regular Google app experience is superior in every other regard. It takes voice and text input as one and the same, has many features that have not yet been ported to Assistant, and offers a consistent experience across all platforms. Verdict: Use the Google app if you like to speak and type to your virtual assistant, or if you prefer extra features. For the time being, the Google app's voice and text controls offer more functionality than any of the official Google Assistant platforms.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The Better One Between Apple iPhone 8 vs. Google Pixel 2 Corazon Victorino International Business TimesMarch 5, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share After Google confirmed that a Pixel successor is hitting the market this year, the device is now expected to be one of the major competitors of Apple’s upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone, which is speculated to debut with the “iPhone 8” moniker. The iPhone 7 was not so much of an upgrade compared to its predecessor, so Apple is poised to change that with the next iPhone. On the other hand, Google’s Pixel 2 could raise the bar for Android smartphones coming out this 2017. Given that both handsets are likely to emerge successful upon their respective launch, it’s just fitting for us to look into them and see if one can one-up the other based on their rumored specs and features. Performance Apple’s iPhone 7 impressed a lot of people when it launched with the Apple A10 Fusion chip, which is basically a quad-core ARM processor composed of two high-performance Hurricane cores and two high-efficiency Zephyr cores. The six-core PowerVR Series7XT Plus GPU was also no joke for it enabled the device to do “console-level” performance when running mobile games. This year, the Cupertino giant is rumored to bring its A11 processor to the next-generation iPhone. Back in December, The Motley Fool reported that Apple’s supplier, TSMC, is going to manufacture the smartphone CPU using 10-nanometer technology. It is then expected to be more powerful and faster than the A10 Fusion. As for its GPU, analysts have said that the next-generation iPhone could come equipped with Imagination Technologies’ Series8XT, which is reportedly more power-efficient than the one on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Geekbench scores for the current iPhones are really impressive, so we’re hoping to see higher ratings for the iPhone 8’s performance.  Google also ensured that its flagship smartphone, the Pixel, would be a powerhouse. The Android 7.1 Nougat-running handset debuted with the Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, which is made up of two 2.15 GHz Kryo cores and two 1.6 GHz Kryo cores. The device also came wth the Adreno 530 GPU. The CPU and GPU combo in the Pixel was regarded as pretty stellar by the tech industry at the time. Looking at it now, however, the combination wouldn’t really be as impressive as before. Despite receiving great scores from Geekbench, it’s clear that the Pixel was nowhere near the iPhone 7 in terms of performance. BGR’s comparison of the handsets’ Geekbench scores showed that the Apple device crushed the Google phone in both the single-core (3488 vs. 1565) and multi-core (5590 x 4103) tests. The Pixel 2 is rumored to run on Snapdragon 835 CPU — the same chipset that will be powering Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. If this were the case, then it’s certain that the iPhone 8 will trump the Pixel 2 in terms of performance. The Geekbench results for the Galaxy S8+ have already been leaked, and the Snapdragon 835 chipset received a lower score than the iPhone 7 Plus in the single-core test (1929 vs. 3473). In the multi-core test, the processor did better than the A10 Fusion, but the difference isn’t as significantly large as in the single-core test (6084 vs. 5664).  Display For the most part, the iPhone 8 is claimed to launch with a 5.8-inch display. What would make this screen special is the company’s rumored venture into edge-to-edge display that would see the death of the physical home button. This will not come as a surprise if true because the big players in the smartphone industry are migrating to this type of display for their flagship devices. LG already showed off its edge-to-edge design on the G6 at the recently concluded MWC 2017. Samsung is also said to have embraced this type of display design for its Galaxy S8. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said back in February (via MacRumors) that the iPhone 8's display is an OLED panel. In spite of the larger screen estate, fans can expect the handset itself to retain the size of the current iPhone. Kuo said the measurements of the phone’s form factor would be the same as those of the iPhone 7, but the rather large screen will eat up the entire front panel of the iPhone 8. This would be possible thanks to the advanced technology that would allow Apple to embed its Touch ID fingerprint scanner onto the display itself. Read More There were rumors of Apple killing off Touch ID for a more advanced 3D scanner with facial recognition technology, but come to think of it, it’s unlikely for the Cupertino giant to just get rid of Touch ID after all of the hard work it has put into making it the first line of defense of iPhone users from hackers as well as the verification tool to authorize users’ purchases and other mobile monetary transactions. Nothing about the screen resolution has been mentioned so far, but we’re hoping Apple is considering bumping up the 750 x 1334 resolution and 331 ppi pixel density on the iPhone 7 for this year’s iPhone.  The original Google Pixel launched with a 5-inch AMOLED capacitive screen with 1080 x 1920 screen resolution and 441 ppi pixel density. Based on speculations from tech insiders, Google is sticking with the 5-inch screen size for the Pixel 2. It is also expected to have a 2560 x 1440 screen resolution. This improved screen resolution will make the handset the perfect partner of Google’s VR headset Daydream. While many believe that Google could be bringing the design of the first-generation Pixel to the upcoming version, there are also others who are hoping for the company to follow the new trend of edge-to-edge displays. If done well, this could help increase the reception of consumers since not everyone was a fan of the rather large top and bottom bezels of the original Pixel smartphone. Pocket-lint says shrinking the bezels is one way for Google to stay competitive now that most of the big players in the phone-making scene are starting to embrace the almost bezel-less design for their devices. There also wouldn’t be a problem if the Mountain View giant shifts to edge-to-edge display since the fingerprint scanner on the original Pixel is rear-mounted. By keeping the sensor at the back, Google will have less challenges to take on in making the almost all-screen front possible.  Camera Technology At launch, the biggest selling point of the iPhone 7 was its advanced camera technology. Its bigger brother stole the show for the most part with its dual-lens camera module that was marketed as a technology that captures DLSR-quality photos. The iPhone 7 also has a similar kind of camera; the only difference is it has a single lens instead of two. It has the same 12-megapixel sensor, phase detection autofocus, optical image stabilization and the quad-LED (dual tone) flash. For its front camera, the iPhone 7 sports a 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera that’s capable of taking 1080p@30fps videos. It also has face detection, HDR and panoramic features. There’s no word yet on how Apple intends to top the rear camera of the iPhone 7, but there’s now word on a powerful front-facing selfie camera with 3D-sensing capabilities. This actually fueled speculations that Apple is getting rid of Touch ID because the front snapper is said to function as a 3D facial scanner as well as an iris scanner. JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall was even quoted by MacRumors in a separate report that facial recognition is a more secure alternative for Apple Pay.  On the contrary, Google set the bar high for Android-powered phones in terms of camera technology when it introduced its Google Pixel late last year. It even got a recognition from DxO Mark as the best smartphone camera yet. The back camera on the Pixel has a 12.3-megapixel sensor, an f/2.0 aperture, electronic image stabilization and laser autofocus as well as dual-LED (dual tone) flash. Despite not really having specifications that would make it stand out by leaps, Wired explains that the camera just impresses and blows everyone away because its HDR+ marquee mode takes images in rapid succession, analyzes them and creates some tone-mapping magic to create stunning photographs. The 8-megapixel front snapper is also commendable. This 2017, Google is likely to put a major emphasis on the camera of the Pixel 2. 9to5Google learned through sources that the company is developing a camera lens that will perform impressively even in low light conditions. The megapixels will not see a significant increase, but Google is going to compensate for this with extra camera features. Miscellaneous The iPhone 8 is going to have a water-resistant body. Compared to its predecessor, The Korea Herald reports the next-generation iPhone will have a higher water resistance rating. The iPhone 7 has IP67 rating by the way. With the 10th anniversary iPhone, Apple is aiming for an IP68 rating that would enable users to submerge their handsets underwater for 30 minutes without negative repercussions. There are also rumors Apple is re-adopting the glass body it used on the iPhone 4 instead of keeping its streak of using the aluminum body found on the recent iPhones. Apple supplier Catcher Technology says (via Nikkei) the glass body is returning this year. If true, Apple could make use of stainless steel frames to hold together the front and back glass panels of the device. For users who are very particular with the internal memory of their daily driver, the next iPhone could be the best iPhone for you yet. CNET reported late last month that Samsung’s biggest rival is ditching the 32GB base model for a generous 64GB starting memory variant. Previously, Apple got rid of the 16GB entry-level model when it launched the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Other expected specs and features for the iPhone 8 include wireless charging, support for Apple Pencil, 3GB of RAM and a new color variant (Red). Given the premium hardware of the next-generation iPhone, it is said to come with a hefty price tag that could exceed $1,000.  Water resistance has become a must-have feature of flagship phones, so the Pixel 2 is also rumored to sport a water-resistant body. Trusted Reviews claims Google could be looking to build a handset with either an IP67 or IP68 rating just to compete with the iPhone 8 and the Galaxy S8. The Pixel 2 is also expected to come with a tougher build because the original Pixel’s metal body is prone to scratches and dents. Some are hoping for Google to improve the audio experience in the next-generation Pixel since the first-generation device have tiny and downward facing speakers. Perhaps Google could equip the handset with more powerful speakers to make it a notable media-centric device. Rumor also has it that the Mountain View-headquartered company is going to increase the base model’s internal memory. The first Pixel debuted with 32GB and 128GB storage variants. Since video files and mobile games are becoming more ambitious, a larger internal memory would come in handy. Thus, sources are saying Google could be boosting the base model’s storage to 64GB. Other standout features that are expected for the Pixel 2 include Quick Charge 4.0 and Android 8 or another modified Android software like the Android 7.1 Nougat of the first Pixel. Meanwhile, it’s very likely for Google to keep the same price points of the predecessors for the new models.  Apple is likely to launch the iPhone 8 in September, while Google could hold an October/November launch event for the Pixel 2.

Google’s plans of rolling out the Google Assistant for Android devices was initially unveiled during the Mobile World Congress 2017. The availability of the update will not be in the form of an app. Instead, Google will introduce the Google Assistant to Android devices through the inclusion of a functionality in the Google Play Store. An update to Google Play services will pop up in the Google Play Store, which means you’re getting the Assistant on your device. Users must be using an Android Marshmallow or Nougat device with at least 1.5 GB of RAM and 720 px resolution screen to be able to avail Assistant’s new features. Google announced the expansion of the Google Assistant to Android devices via a tweet too.   Now rolling out to more @Android phones, it’s time to meet your #GoogleAssistant ? https://t.co/tu9bGCgo7F pic.twitter.com/aeWdgBTJH1 — Google (@Google) March 2, 2017 While the other eligible Android devices are waiting for the update, the LG G6 bagged the title of being the first non-Pixel phone to be shipped with Google Assistant. Google claims that “hundreds of millions of Android users” will now be able to use the Google Assistant, instead of the voice search feature. In order to activate the Google Assistant, all the user has to do is long press the Home button. Though Google hasn’t specified the list of “eligible” devices, the update will first be available to Android users in the United States, followed by the United Kingdom,Australia, Canada and Germany. As far as users in India are concerned, it has not yet been ascertained when the Google Assistant update will be launched here. likethis What's your reaction?

Somewhere between 30 and 50 million websites rely on it for tracking and measuring the metrics that matter to them. It’s powerful. It’s robust. It’s free (and everyone loves free). But it’s not perfect. Like everything else, it has its shortcomings. It’s flawed, occasionally misleading, and an outright failure in some ways. Analyzing and exploring the data it collects can guide your decisions and help you transform your website into a conversion machine. That’s good. However, there are some things it can’t tell you. Information you need to make the most informed decisions about your business, your website, and your marketing strategies. That’s bad. Are there ways to bridge those gaps? You better believe it. User Experience and Intent The most consistent complaint against the platform is that it focuses too much on your success — traffic, clicks, downloads, and conversions — and not enough on your failures, which can be even more revealing. Analytics excels at presenting the “what:” bounce rates, exit pages, traffic sources, session length, landing pages, site speed, and so on. It’s not so good at giving you a “why,” and that’s arguably the more important question. It’s great to know your conversion rate. It’s wonderful to see that Facebook sends a steady stream of traffic your way. But what about the people that visit your site, explore a little (or a lot), and then leave? Or customers that abandon their cart on the last step? Wouldn’t it be great to have some data about that, to know why it happened (and not just that it did)? You can. You just need to look beyond Analytics. There are dozens of tools and services out there to give you that priceless insight: Q&A The easiest thing to remember in both life and business is that if you don’t know, ask. Simple. So if you don’t know why your visitors and customers are doing or not doing something, ask them. But how? A service like Qualaroo can do it for you. They provide real-time opportunities to ask targeted questions at particular points in your funnel, on certain pages, exit surveys when they click to leave, or for segmented audiences (based on time on page, number of visits, and more). Their onsite surveys ask the right questions at the right time (while it’s happening), collating the responses and presenting them to you in easy-to-digest reports. These “voice of customer” insights lead to better, stronger business decisions, and that leads to a better, stronger business. Heat Maps Get a visual representation of how visitors are interacting (and actively not interacting) with each page on your site. A heat map like Crazy Egg or Simple Heatmaps provides tons of data on user clicks, attention, and scrolling. See exactly where they do and do not click, look, scroll (and stop scrolling), and read. You can eliminate or improve dead zones, streamline pages by removing links, forms, and content that is being ignored, opting to move it or lose it. You can even color code those clicks and looks by the originating source of the traffic. Give your visitors the website they want, based on what they’re already doing and not doing on it. Session Replays Imagine being able to stand behind your visitors and watch over their shoulder as they explore and engage with your site. You’d see firsthand where they get confused, when the navigation is misleading, their path from arrival to ultimate conversion, and so on. A valuable exercise, but unrealistic. Or is it? You can get the same virtual experience with a tool like Jaco or Clicktale. They can record every user session in its entirety — complete with session transcript, advanced filters, and session scorecard — allowing you to watch at your leisure and see exactly what they’re doing, problems they’re having, obstacles, bottlenecks, hesitation, and more. See your website, product, or service through their eyes. Experience the buyer’s journey from their perspective. And then make it better for them. The best way to understand and appreciate the user experience is to experience it. These tools let you do that. Get the “why” to go with the Analytics “what”. Call Tracking We live in a mobile, digital, always-connected world. But to assume no one is using “older” technology like the phone is premature. People are still going to call for more information, or to make an appointment, or to request a quote, or to make a purchase. You’ve most likely got your business number listed somewhere on your website and marketing materials. Google Analytics can tell you when someone arrives at your digital doorstep via Twitter, or Instagram, or that guest post on another industry blog. That’s useful information that helps you allocate budget and resources (more to channels working, less to those that aren’t). But what if someone calls you after getting your number from your Facebook Page? You have no way of tracking that point-of-contact. You just know they called you. Maybe you jot that down in the customer profile (if you create one), maybe you don’t. Either way, Facebook isn’t getting the credit it deserves for that new lead/customer. Enter call tracking. With it, you attach a unique phone number to each campaign or channel in order to track who’s calling and to which campaign they’re responding for each call you receive. That’s the kind of detailed attribution you need. Why is this important? A phone call response typically converts in the 30-50% range (we only call when we’re really, really interested), compared to only 1-2% for online clicks, and up to 92% of calls coming through to a business originate from a digital campaign. That’s why. Call tracking providers like CallRail or Call Sumo bridge the gap between your online marketing and real-world responses. They can record those calls, and offer call management, call attribution, and call analytics. Let Analytics handle the digital responses and traffic. But for the humble phone call, you need to look elsewhere. Speaking of attribution… Attribution Problems Without a little extra work and tweaking, Analytics is notoriously mediocre at attribution. It’s a session-based platform that’s great at tracking a user during a single session: where they came from, what they did once they arrived, and where they exited. It is not great at multi-session visits. Part of the problem stems from how GA tracks users. It needs access to someone’s tracking cookies, but if a user frequently deletes those cookies, for example, then you run into all kinds of problems. No cookie, and a return visitor to your site will be cataloged as a new user by GA. If they visit, erase the cookie, visit again, erase again, and finally visit a third time and sign up for your newsletter, Analytics will classify them as a first-time new user, and that conversion will be credited to whatever channel brought them back that third time (most likely direct, which is why direct traffic numbers on GA are often skewed). One way around this that provides at least better (though not perfect) attribution and session tracking is assigning a unique user ID to each visitor. You have to set it up on your Analytics view (you have to enable it and then implement in your code), but once you do, you’ll be able to connect multiple devices, sessions, and engagement for more accurate user and attribution data. Another simple tweak to ensure you’re getting reliable campaign data is to use UTM parameters for each marketing campaign you have going. Use Google’s Campaign URL Builder, fill in the required fields, and then see accurate and precise data for each individual campaign under Acquisition > Campaigns > All Campaigns. See which ones are bringing people in, converting, and growing your business (and by extension, which ones aren’t). It’s an easy enhancement to GA, but there are a number of common mistakes people are making over and over again. Read through and avoid them. With multi-channel marketing (and let’s face it, most of us are using several channels), proper user and attribution data is crucial. Give GA everything it needs to present the best data possible. Keywords (Not Provided) Last but not least, you already understand the importance of keywords to your digital marketing and SEO efforts. Analytics is not much help here unless you connect your Search Console and GA accounts (enable it under Admin > Property > Property Settings > Search Console). Once you do, you can see the search terms that are bringing people to your site under Acquisition > Search Console > Queries. You’ll see each search query along with its corresponding impressions, clicks, CTR, and Average Position. Useful, but you’ll also likely see the dreaded (Not Provided). Google is encrypting more and more of its keyword data, making your job that much harder. But there are a few ways to glean a bit more information. For starters, drill down to the landing page level and add keyword as secondary dimension. Head on over to Behavior > Site Content > Landing Pages. Scroll down to the bottom list, click on Secondary dimension, and type “Keyword” in the field to add that data set to the report. Now, for each page that people arrive on, you’ll see the search words that are bringing them in. If you see (Not Provided) for any page, you can take a reasonable guess as to the missing term by either a) considering the keywords you targeted with that page, or b) comparing it to the provided terms for that same page. Is it a perfect solution? Not at all. But it does give you a bit more to work with. You might also consider using paid search a bit more, too. The keywords for your AdWord campaigns are not hidden from you like they are for organic search. You’ll see all the terms bringing in paid traffic. Google Analytics is good, but it’s not without its flaws. The suggestions here can provide more of what you need, but it’s still not everything. At a minimum, connect your GA account to Search Console for better organic search query data. Connect it to your Adwords account for query, sitelink, and cost data, as well as richer data sets in general. Turn on Advertising Reporting Features (found under Admin > Property > Tracking Info > Data Collection) for more visitor detailed demographics and interests. And if you’re tired of just not “getting” Analytics in the first place, check out a beginner’s guide. There’s no shame in starting at the beginning. Even the experts among us were newbies at some point. Finally, don’t forget that Google Analytics is not the only game in town. Alternatives include Adobe Analytics, Piwik, and Clicky (which very cleverly highlights the features either missing or inadequate in Analytics). Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and might be a better fit for what you need from your analytics solution. Clicky, for example, provides reports on every single person who visits your website, along with video analytics, search keyword rankings, and heat maps built right in. Adobe Analytics provides better data storage, and Piwik is open source. Find the right tool for your job. What data is missing from Google Analytics for your needs? What do you use to fill that gap?

The reports claimed the Chrome OS-running, Pixel-branded laptops have been discontinued by the Mountain View giant. Apparently, such reports are not at all true.  Osterloh has come out to correct the misinformation about Google’s budget-friendly laptop series. According to him, his statement at MWC 2017 may have been taken out of context, and this was what led many people to believe that Google does not intend to release more Chromebooks.  On Twitter, Osterloh clarified that Google is still building new Chromebooks, but the company does not have plans to release one as of this time. He wrote, “Hey all, Google’s own Chromebooks aren’t ‘dead‘ as has been reported. They will live on, we just have *no plans to share at this time* ;)”  According to TechnoBuffalo, it just makes sense for Google to continue with its Chromebooks business. After all, it is among the companies creating high-end Chromebooks that many people really appreciate and prefer over regular Windows-running laptops. The Google hardware is also seen by many as a good alternative to expensive Windows and Mac OS-powered portable computers.  Google introduced its first Chromebook Pixel device in 2013 and released a follow-up in 2015. Two years ago, Time reported that Chromebooks did well in the market with the education sector comprising 72 percent of the sales. In 2014, Chromebooks even beat out Apple’s iPad shipments to schools because they are cheaper and they appeal to users who simply want a practical device for school work. At present, there's already a large number of Chromebooks up for grabs in the market. Samsung, Asus, Dell, Acer and HP have since joined Google in providing consumers with more Chrome OS-running laptop options.  GoogleMore Google will continue the Chromebooks series despite reports saying the laptop line is dead.

Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler’s impending departure, announced just 15 months after he joined Tesla from Google, will be the latest in a raft of largely under-the-radar exits. Former executives, who spoke on the condition they not be identified, cited a range of reasons for their exits over the past year, including long hours in the rush to high-volume production, mission creep, and a tense culture that reflects their visionary but indefatigable chief executive officer, Elon Musk. “Tesla looks like a company that is getting stretched to the limit,” said Dave Sullivan, an analyst at industry researcher AutoPacific Inc. “The pressure of getting out the Model 3 is getting to everybody, from the people on the factory floor to the people at the top.” A Tesla spokesman in an emailed statement called attracting and retaining talent “one of our biggest assets” and said the company’s attrition rate was below average among technology companies. Long hours and job-hopping are routine at tech companies in California’s Silicon Valley, and Palo Alto-based Tesla continues to make high-profile hires. Even so, analysts have flagged the departures as a risk to what will be Tesla’s most challenging execution year in its short history. Musk plans to introduce the Model 3, is starting battery production at the Gigafactory and will integrate SolarCity, the recent acquisition that pushed Tesla’s global workforce to roughly 30,000 people. Like many companies, Tesla noted among risk factors in its just-filed annual report that it needs to attract and retain skilled workers. This year, however, it added a new phrase to the boilerplate, saying the efforts are needed “especially to support our expansion plans and ramp to high-volume manufacture of vehicles.” “Any time you’re going through a big change it’s important to have consistent management,” Colin Langan, a UBS analyst who has a sell rating on the stock, said in an interview. “Jason Wheeler was a big hire and he’s leaving, and there have been many other departures. If you’re putting out aggressive targets and the people aren’t there to meet them, it’s a problem.” Wheeler, whose departure was first announced on last week’s quarterly earnings call, said he wants to pursue work in public policy and praised what he called the “A-team” at Tesla. Deepak Ahuja, the CFO who led Tesla from the brink of bankruptcy through its 2010 initial public offering and retired in 2015, will return in April for a second tour of duty. Bloomberg News compiled a list of more than two dozen management departures over the past year that include vice presidents of finance, communications, regulatory affairs, production, manufacturing, products and programs. Most recently Tesla has lost Mark Lipscomb, its vice president of human resources, and Satish Jeyachandran, the director of hardware engineering. Tesla is generally opaque about its leadership beyond Musk and Chief Technical Officer J.B. Straubel, with no list of executives or vice presidents on its website, its investor relations page or in the annual report filed with the SEC this week. Among Tesla’s senior leadership team, three quarters have more than three years of tenure, 60 percent have been with the company at least six years and 20 percent have worked there a decade, according to its spokesman. Almost 60 percent of those who’ve had a leadership position at Tesla over its 14-year existence are still with the company, Tesla said. None of the former managers Bloomberg News reached agreed to speak on the record. Goldman Sachs this week downgraded Tesla to sell from neutral, with analyst David Tamberrino casting doubt on its ability to deliver the Model 3 on time. The Feb. 27 report contributed to the shares dropping about 11 percent from their 19-month closing high of $280.98 on Feb. 14. Of 23 analysts tracked by Bloomberg, eight have buy ratings on the shares, nine are neutral and six recommend selling. Tesla’s shares have jumped about 28 percent over the past year. Revenue surged 73 percent to more than $7 billion in 2016. When Tesla announced in January it hired Chris Lattner from Apple as vice president of Autopilot software, it didn’t mention that Sterling Anderson, the executive who ran the entire Autopilot program and reported directly to Musk, departed in late December. Tesla then sued Anderson, alleging he broke his confidentiality agreement with the company. Aurora Innovation, the company Anderson started with the former head of Google’s self-driving project, said it would fight the “meritless” lawsuit. Several former Tesla employees have landed at other auto companies, including Future Mobility Corp., Nio and Waymo, the self-driving car business spun off by Google parent Alphabet. To be sure, Tesla’s clean-energy mission and compelling products has attracted high-caliber people, regardless of its hard-driving reputation. The 45-year-old Musk has described himself as a “nano manager,” has kept a sleeping bag at the company’s car factory and works a second job running a rocket company. About half of Musk’s roughly $11.6 billion in estimated wealth comes from Tesla, where he takes no salary but is the largest shareholder with a 21 percent stake. As of Dec. 31, Tesla had about 17,800 employees, not counting another 12,200 added with the $2 billion acquisition of SolarCity last year. Despite the growing headcount, more than 2,000 job postings at Tesla are listed on the recruiting website Taleo. Tesla produced almost 84,000 vehicles in 2016 and plans to make half a million in 2018, then 1 million in 2020. It expects to pick locations for more gigafactories by the end of this year, and to introduce a semi truck and bus. Earlier this week it was named the highest-ranked domestic car brand by Consumer Reports magazine. One worker at Tesla’s Fremont, California, auto plant touched off a unionization effort last month, publishing a Medium post describing 60- to 70-hour work weeks, safety-related issues and mandatory overtime. The unionization talk has drawn pushback from Musk. He promised employees free frozen yogurt stands, an electric pod-car roller coaster connecting parking lots to the factory and a “really amazing party once Model 3 reaches volume production later this year,” according to an internal email Buzzfeed obtained last month. Musk’s moves to lighten the environment show the union threat has registered, AutoPacific’s Sullivan said. “If Tesla has more than 2,000 job openings, does that mean that people are overloaded, or doubling up? You can’t constantly ask for the impossible.”     Tesla Motors model X electric car in showroom.(테슬라 모터스 모델 X 전기 자동차가 쇼룸에 전시된 모습.) 블룸버그 한계에 다다른 테슬라 업무강도, 주요 인재들이 빠져 나간다 다나 헐 회사에 가장 중요한 모델인 모델 3 출시를 앞두고 박차를 가하면서 테슬라가 주요 인재들을 잃고 있다. 테슬라에서 일을 시작한지 15개월 만에 CFO 제이슨 윌러가 곧 사임할 의사를 밝혔다. 제이슨 윌러는 테슬라에 오기 전 구글에서 일을 하고 있었다.  이외에도 알려지지 않은 체 많은 인재들이 회사를 떠나고 있다. 테슬라를 떠난 다른 경영진 인사들은 회사를 떠나게 된 이유로 긴 업무시간, 예상밖에 생기는 업무, 긴장감이 감도는 업무 문화를 꼽았다. 업무 문화는 비전을 제시하는 천재이자 지칠 줄 모르는 에너지의  CEO 일론 머스크의 성향을 반영한다. “테슬라는 지금 한계점에 달한 것 같다”고 산업리서치회사 오토퍼시픽의 애널리스트 데이브 설리반이 말했다.  “모델 3를 기한 내에 출시해야한다는 압박감이 회사 전 직원들에게 영향을 미치고 있다.” 테슬라 대변인은 이메일 발표문에서 인재들을 영입하고 보존하는 것이 회사의 가장 큰 자산 중의 하나라고 설명했다.  그에 따르면 테슬라의 인재 이직율은 전반적인 테크놀로지 회사 평균보다 낮다고 한다. 긴 업무시간과 직원들의 이직은 실리콘 밸리에서 항시적으로 있는 일이다. 그리고 팔로 알토에 위치한 테슬라는 계속해서 업계 주요 인사들을 영입하고 있다. 그럼에도 애널리스트들은 회사의 짧은 역사에서 가장 중대한 도전을 하는 시기인 올해 인재들이 떠나는 것을 중대한 위기로 판단한다.  테슬라는 올해 모델 3를 출시할 계획이고 이를 위해 새로운 공장 기가팩토리에서 베터리 생산을 시작했다. 그리고 태양열 에너지 회사 솔라시티와 통합할 예정이다. 솔라시티와의 합병은 최근의 일로 완료된 후에는 테슬라의 직원이 3만명에 육박할 것으로 보인다. “큰 변화의 시기에는 일관성 있는 경영진을 유지하는 것이 중요하다” 고 콜린 랭언 유비에스 애널리스트가 말했다.  그는 테슬라 ‘매도’의견을 냈다. 그는 또한 인터뷰에서 “제이슨 윌러는 아주 중요한 영입이었습니다. 그는 이제 곧 회사를 떠난다. 이 외에도 많은 인재들이 떠났다. 당신이 야심찬 목표를 설정했을 때 사람들이 그 목표를 달성하기 위해 자리를 지키지 않고 떠난다면 이는 큰 문제이다.”        (번역: 이동근)    <저작권자 © 울산매일, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지>  저작권 문의 블룸버그 다른기사 보기 페이스북 이메일 기사 수정 :   2017-03-05 20:20   노옥진 기자 입력.편집 :   2017-03-05 20:20   노옥진 기자 icon오늘의 인기기사 90년대 풍미한 '한국계' 미국 아이돌 토미 페이지 사망 강릉서 마티즈-모하비 승용차 충돌 현대중공업 노사, 임시주총 이후 첫 협상… 또 입장차 확인만 분할법인 출범 20여일 남았는데… 노조 임단협 ‘발등에 불’ 금오공대 학생회관에 쌓여있는 술 상자 티샷 날리는 전인지 90년대 풍미한 '한국계' 미국 아이돌 토미 페이지 사망 댓글 (200자평) 0개 전체보기 200자까지 쓰실 수 있습니다. 등록 ※ 비속어와 인신공격성 글 등은 바로 삭제됩니다. 특히, 근거 없는 글로 타인의 명예를 훼손하면 민·형사상 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다.

It was announced in a blog post by Google celebrating the success of Chromebooks in Swedish schools. Not a lot of details are available about this model. Google only mentioned a 360 degree rotating hinge with USB-C charging, optional stylus, and an outward-facing camera. It's likely that the HP Chromebook x360 11 G1 Education Edition is based entirely on the HP ProBook x360 11 G1 Education Edition, which comes with Windows 10 Pro. In that case it should have the same Intel Celeron N3350 or Pentium N4200 processor, 8GB DDR3 RAM, 128GB flash storage and 11.6-inch 1366x768 resolution touchscreen display. No pricing has been announced yet but it will be available for purchase in mid-April.

Reply Claudiu.Lucian LaAm 05 Mar 2017 Why not? 128GB is not that much for a laptop(on Windows you need 256GB to have space for anything) , ok you can get along with Chrome OS on 64GB, but the 128 one is considerably faster, being a M.2 SDD, not a cheap eMMC.

Many lives hang on that one decision. But the task is so vast and difficult that agreement between different pathologists studying the same slides can be as low as only 48 per cent, according to reports. Which is why Google is working on an automated system to complete this task wih a Deep Learning AI project and the results are astonishing. "There can be many slides per patient, each of which is 10+ gigapixels when digitized at 40X magnification. Imagine having to go through a thousand 10 megapixel (MP) photos, and having to be responsible for every pixel. Needless to say, this is a lot of data to cover, and often time is limited," says experts. That's why Google has been working on an advanced image-recognition system for several years now through the GoogLeNet projects. This project was initially for the autonomous car project of the company, to teach the self-driving cars to recognise road layouts, stop signs etc. Now Google is applying the same GoogLeNet tech for the cancer diagnosis system. "After additional customization, including training networks to examine the image at different magnifications (much like what a pathologist does), we showed that it was possible to train a model that either matched or exceeded the performance of a pathologist who had unlimited time to examine the slides," says Google. Recently the AI system was pitted against an experienced expert pathologist to examine slides in an unlimited time frame. While the human being achieved 73 per cent accuracy, by the end of tweaking, GoogLeNet scored a smooth 89 per cent accuracy. However, Google has said that they do not expect this AI system to replace pathologists, as the system still generates false positives. Moreover, this system cannot detect the other irregularities that a human pathologist can pick. The plan, as Google says, is to point out the suspected regions for a pathologist to review them. It could also help measure the tumor size more accurately, which is very significant in developing a prognosis for cancer. Google has published a white paper explaining the project.

The smartphone has been created by Google who is also the Android parent. There are many factors which helped Pixel gather such a large customer base and one of them is certainly its sleek design. Even though Pixel’s design looks impressive, Google has received some harsh criticism for designing it the same way iPhone 6 was designed. Google Pixel Copied iPhone 6’s Design Google has been producing smartphones for a long while now but Pixel is the first ever “Google-made” smartphone. All the other devices have been created in partnership with other tech manufacturers and branded under the Nexus name. Before Google decided to venture into the smartphone world by itself, it analyzed all that its competition was offering and decided to mimic their best features on Pixel. We think it’s pretty safe to say that Pixel is just an iPhone 6 with a glass back plate when it comes to design. What’s really intriguing though is that Apple has actually copied HTC One’s design when it created iPhone 6. This looks like we have a vicious circle on our hands. Even better, Google has actually copied another Apple feature. We are talking about the exterior antenna. A few years ago, Apple decided to implement an innovative antenna design on iPhone 4. The smartphone had its antenna spread out on the back panel, similar to the way Pixel has been designed. We should mention that when Apple first launched the iPhone that featured an exterior antenna, the company received some harsh criticism because of it. iPhone 4 users needed to be careful how they hold the device since if their hand covered the antenna, the device lost its signal strength. Apple was eventually forced to start giving out free bumper cases so that iPhone 4 owners would be happy. Nonetheless, rumor has it that Google is actually working on creating Pixel 2 right now. Maybe the new flagship smartphone will finally feature an exclusive design. Obviously the smartphone will feature the back plate piece of glass because it’s seen as Google’s trademark, but maybe it will ship with an innovative edge to edge display.

Rumors about the upcoming Google Pixel 2 handset have spread around the internet in quick succession and the tech giant has finally made a statement regarding the upcoming Pixel device which was confirmed to be launched somewhere in the last quarter of 2017. Tech enthusiasts are wondering what features will it bring and considering the fact that the Pixel was a major success, the upcoming handset will not disappoint whatsoever. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL devices were launched in 2016 and have brought the attention of the tech world in terms of being extremely divisive between fans as they have had a love-hate relationship with them. A lot of specialists consider the Pixel lineup to be the best Android phones available on the market as it came with amazing features such as the best camera encountered on a smartphone as well as some amazing battery life and an overall solid performance. The tech giant has recently announced that the Pixel lineup will receive a sequel in 2017 and will most likely be named the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel XL 2. There are still some rumors around the internet that the Google HQ is still working on some other names. Google’s Pixel lineup has a lot of ways in which it can be improved. Google can definitely improve the way in which their handsets are designed and upcoming Pixel devices should vent towards a more exciting and daring looks rather than opting for a dull model. The original lineup was regarded as extremely conventional and conservative. The next big improvement which might hit the new Pixel lineup is water and dust resistance which was completely lacking from the previous generation of handsets and judging by the fact that they are aimed at the premium market, it is a feature which should be included. Google should also improve the way in which people could store more media in their devices by adding microSD support to their devices as there are some amazing SD card options around. Wireless charging is yet another important feature which should be added to the Pixel as many manufacturers already rolled out devices with this amazing feature.

Google Home One of the biggest problems with virtual assistants and smart speakers which greatly enhance the way we live our lives is that they only work with a single account. The latest version of Google Home app is showing some signs that the tech giant is working towards a way of improving its functionality as it is going to receive some much needed support for multi-users. There are some hints in the code which suggest their future devices or software to be able to recognize a user’s voice without needing to be trained. The Google device will soon be able to recognize to whom it is speaking to and tech enthusiasts are going to have a blast by Google adding a multi-voice support to their Google Home device. Google is yet to release a statement which supports the upcoming feature of Google home and when asked about this feature, they have state that they are working towards improving the way in which people will interact with Google Home but they do not have any specific updates at this given time. There are a lot of tech manufacturers who have entered the smart speaker game and they show no signs of working towards a system which knows to whom is it talking to thus being one of the device’s biggest limitations yet. Having a digital assistant is extremely beneficial but if commands are not recognized by any other people living under the same roof, such devices seem a little bit lackluster. Amazon is also working towards their Alexa being able to recognize multiple voice patterns and the feature is pretty much set to receive an update as they are working towards fixing the latest privacy concerns. It is already able to switch between users but those who use the device need to manually switch between them. Google’s multi-user support is extremely early in development and there is a slight chance that it will hit Google Home devices anytime soon. It seems that the project is still in the works and we are yet to hear an announcement made by the tech giant regarding this concern.

Rosenwald 1 day ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL 10 tips for saving money at Costco and big box stores Donald Trump's superyacht and other billionaire boats © Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post Asher Labovich, 13, and his 10-year-old sister, Emerson, mess around with the family’s Alexa while their mom, Laura, watches in Bethesda, Md. Kids adore their new robot siblings. As millions of American families buy robotic voice assistants to turn off lights, order pizzas and fetch movie times, children are eagerly co-opting the gadgets to settle dinner table disputes, answer homework questions and entertain friends at sleepover parties. Many parents have been startled and intrigued by the way these disembodied, know-it-all voices — Amazon’s Alexa, Google Home, Microsoft’s Cortana — are impacting their kids’ behavior, making them more curious but also, at times, far less polite. In just two years, the promise of the technology has already exceeded the marketing come-ons. The disabled are using voice assistants to control their homes, order groceries and listen to books. Caregivers to the elderly say the devices help with dementia, reminding users what day it is or when to take medicine. For children, the potential for transformative interactions are just as dramatic — at home and in classrooms. But psychologists, technologists and linguists are only beginning to ponder the possible perils of surrounding kids with artificial intelligence, particularly as they traverse important stages of social and language development. “How they react and treat this nonhuman entity is, to me, the biggest question,” said Sandra Calvert, a Georgetown University psychologist and director of the Children’s Digital Media Center. “And how does that subsequently affect family dynamics and social interactions with other people?” With an estimated 25 million voice assistants expected to sell this year at $40 to $180 — up from 1.7 million in 2015 — there are even ramifications for the diaper crowd. Toy giant Mattel recently announced the birth of Aristotle, a home baby monitor launching this summer that “comforts, teaches and entertains” using AI from Microsoft. As children get older, they can ask or answer questions. The company says, “Aristotle was specifically designed to grow up with a child.” Boosters of the technology say kids typically learn to acquire information using the prevailing technology of the moment — from the library card catalogue, to Google, to brief conversations with friendly, all-knowing voices. But what if these gadgets lead children, whose faces are already glued to screens, further away from situations where they learn important interpersonal skills? It’s unclear whether any of the companies involved are even paying attention to this issue. Amazon did not return a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Partnership for AI, a new organization that includes Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other companies working on voice assistants, said nobody was available to answer questions. “These devices don’t have emotional intelligence,” said Allison Druin, a University of Maryland professor who studies how children use technology. “They have factual intelligence.” Children certainly enjoy their company, referring to Alexa like just another family member. “We like to ask her a lot of really random things,” said Emerson Labovich, a fifth-grader in Bethesda, Md., who pesters Alexa with her older brother Asher. This winter, Emerson asked her almost every day help counting down the days until a trip to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Florida. “She can also rap and rhyme,” Emerson said. Today’s children will be shaped by AI much like their grandparents were shaped by new devices called television. But you couldn’t talk with a TV. Ken Yarmosh, a 36-year-old Northern Virginia app developer and founder of Savvy Apps has multiple voice assistants in his family’s home, including those made by Google and Amazon. (The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos, whose middle name is Preston, according to Alexa.) © Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post The Laboviches sit at their kitchen table with Alexa. Yarmosh’s 2-year-old son has been so enthralled by Alexa that he tries to speak with coasters and other cylindrical objects that look like Amazon’s device. Meanwhile, Yarmosh’s now 5-year-old son, in comparing his two assistants, came to believe Google knew him better. “Alexa isn’t smart enough for me,” he’d say, asking random questions that his parents couldn’t answer, like how many miles it is to China. (“China is 7,248 miles away, ” Google Home says, “as the crow flies.”) In talking that way about a device plugged into a wall, Yarmosh’s son was anthropomorphizing it — which means to “ascribe human features to something,” Alexa happily explains. Humans do this a lot, Calvert said. We do it with dogs, dressing them in costumes on Halloween. We name boats. And when we encounter robots, we — especially children — treat them as near equals. In 2012, University of Washington researchers published results of a study involving 90 children interacting with a life-size robot named Robovie. Most kids thought Robovie had “mental states” and was a “social being.” When Robovie was shoved into a closet, more than half felt it wasn’t fair. A similar emotional connection is taking hold with Alexa and other assistants — even for parents. “It’s definitely become part of our lives,” said Emerson’s mother, Laura Labovich, who then quickly corrected herself: “She’s definitely part of our lives.” The problem, Druin said, is that this emotional connection sets up expectations for children that devices can’t or weren’t designed to meet, causing confusion, frustration and even changes in the way kids talk or interact with adults. Yarmosh’s son thought Alexa couldn’t understand him, but it was the algorithms that couldn’t grasp the pitch in his voice or the way children formulate questions. Educators introducing these devices into classrooms and school libraries have encountered the same issue. “If Alexa doesn’t understand the question, is it Alexa’s fault or might it be the question’s fault?” said Gwyneth Jones, a librarian who uses Amazon’s device at Murray Hill Middle School in Laurel, Maryland.  “People are not always going to get what they are saying, so it’s important that they learn how to ask good questions.” Naomi S. Baron, an American University linguist who studies digital communication, is among those who wonder whether the devices, even as they get smarter, will push children to value simplistic language — and simplistic inquiries — over nuance and complex questions. Asking Alexa, “How do you ask a good question?” produces this answer: “I wasn’t able to understand the question I heard.” But she is able to answer a simple derivative: “What is a question?” © Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post For the Laboviches, Alexa is treated as a member of the family. “A linguistic expression used to make a request for information,” she says. And then there is the potential rewiring of adult-child communication. Although Mattel’s new assistant will have a setting forcing children to say “please” when asking for information, the assistants made by Google, Amazon and others are designed so users can quickly — and bluntly — ask questions. Parents are noticing some not-so-subtle changes in their children. In a blog post last year, a California venture capitalist wrote that his 4-year-old daughter thought Alexa was the best speller in the house. “But I fear it’s also turning our daughter into a raging a------,” Hunter Walk wrote. “Because Alexa tolerates poor manners.” To ask her a question, all you need to do is say her name, followed by the query. No “please.” And no “thank you” before asking a follow-up. “Cognitively I’m not sure a kid gets why you can boss Alexa around but not a person,” Walk wrote. “At the very least, it creates patterns and reinforcement that so long as your diction is good, you can get what you want without niceties.” Jones, the librarian, has witnessed the digital equivalent of everybody asking a question at the same time. “You all are being really pushy,” she’ll say, as Alexa declares over and over that she doesn’t understand. “You’re confusing her. One at a time, just like a person.” The personal yet transactional nature of the relationship is appealing to children and teenagers. Parents (including this reporter) have noticed that queries previously made to adults are shifting to assistants, particularly for homework — spelling words, simple math, historical facts. Or take the weather, particularly in winter. Instead of asking Mom or Dad the temperature that day, children just go to the device, treating the answer as gospel. Upside: No more fights over what the temperature will really be and what’s appropriate to wear. Downside: Kids will go to their parents less, with both sides losing out on timeworn interactions. “There can be a lot of unintended consequences to interactions with these devices that mimic conversation,” said Kate Darling, an MIT professor who studies how humans interact with robots. “We don’t know what all of them are yet.” But most researchers, educators and parents — even some kids — already agree that these devices need to be put in their place, just like a know-it-all sibling. Jones, the librarian, puts Alexa away for a couple of weeks at a time, so her students don’t rely on her too much. Yarmosh, who recently launched a project curating online videos for kids, is keeping the assistants out of his children’s rooms. Emerson and her brother take a school playground approach. “Alexa,” they’ll say, “you’re such a butt.” Read more: Are parents ruining youth sports?

But this isn’t great for large files. As Senator Ted Stevens once pointed out, the Internet is a series of tubes, and most providers have rules to stop you from them clogging up. But today, Google announced it doubled the size of attachments you can receive through Gmail, with the maximum size raised from 25MB to 50MB. Annoyingly, the maximum size for an outbound attachment is still 25MB. “We're hunting for awesome startups” Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage! CHECK IT OUT Google’s still very much wedded to the idea of people using Google Drive for large files, but it recognizes that many workplaces and individuals are yet to make the switch to Gmail and Gsuite. This move simply makes it easier for Gmail users to receive large attachments – like high-resolution photos, presentations, and photoshop files – from those holdouts. According to Google’s announcement, this update will propagate to all end-users over the next three days, so keep an eye out for it. And as pointed out by the folks at Android Police, Gmail storage is limited, so be careful. It won’t take that many 50MB attachments to clog up your inbox.

These issues have extended to the many other versions of the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update.

As for the Galaxy Note Edge Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update, it’s pushing out in England. It also looks like its rolled out to the unlocked version of the Galaxy Note Edge in other parts of Europe and to models in Canada. It’s moving like a slug compared to Samsung’s Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow roll out for the Galaxy Note 4 but we expect it to pick up speed in the weeks ahead. We expect the Galaxy Note 4 to remain on Marshmallow. We haven’t seen anyone point to a Nougat release. At least not yet. Features Thanks to these roll outs, we know what the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update looks like. The Galaxy Note 4 update comes with the new Air Command menu that’s found on the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5. There are also some new icons for applications. Similar to the Samsung Galaxy S6’s update. It also comes with the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 feature that allows you to take notes when the device’s screen is off. Others In addition to updates for these popular devices, Samsung is rolling out a number of other Marshmallow updates around the world. Samsung is now pushing the Android 6.0.1 update to the Galaxy A9, a 6-inch smartphone that’s available in limited markets. The Galaxy A9 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is available for the SM-A9000 model in China. The company’s also deployed the first Galaxy A7 and Galaxy A5 Marshmallow updates. The Android 6.0.1 software is rolling out to Galaxy A7 and Galaxy A5 models in Russia. The A7 update is also pushing out in Europe. The Galaxy A5 Marshmallow update is also pushing out to Canadian users. Telus recently confirmed the start of the roll out. The update is also rolling out to Samsung’s budget line of devices. The Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update has made its way over to the Galaxy J5 in India and Europe. Like Samsung’s other Marshmallow upgrades, it brings some huge changes to the device. Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S2 Android 6.0.1 update has started to roll out. The upgrade rolling out right now in Germany for the 9-inch model. It brings well-known Marshmallow features and it also brings a multi-user mode. This mode allows you to create separate accounts for family members and friends. A few more notes: The Galaxy Tab S2 9-inch Marshmallow update is also pushing for the 4G model in the Netherlands. The Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is now rolling out for the 8-inch Galaxy Tab S2 in the United Kingdom. The update is similar to the upgrade for the larger version. Samsung’s Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is also rolling out to the Galaxy Tab S2 on Rogers in Canada and Verizon in the United States. The AT&T Galaxy Tab S2 Marshmallow update is rolling out right now. T-Mobile is also rolling out a Galaxy Tab S2 Marshmallow update in the United States. The update should be available OTA right now. Verizon is also now rolling out a Galaxy Tab E 8.0 Marshmallow update. It’s similar to the other Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow updates for Big Red and those who own this relatively new tablet are encouraged to check for the update right now. Android Marshmallow is also rolling out the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4. The update is currently available for the Wi-Fi model in Europe. As for the rest of Samsung’s tablet line, the Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is also rolling out for the first time to the Galaxy Tab A. The update is pushing out in France to the 9.7-inch Wi-Fi only variant. It’s also pushing out in Australia to the 8-inch Wi-Fi model. The update is a little over 1GB in size and it brings enhancements and new features to the slate. U.S. Cellular’s also started rolling out the Samsung Galaxy S 10.5 Android Marshmallow update after a long wait. Samsung February Security Update Google is rolling out February security updates to its Nexus devices and Samsung is following suit with February security updates of its own. The February security patch is rolling out slowly but it’s now available in several regions including the United States. T-Mobile recently rolled out Samsung’s February security update to the Galaxy S4 and the Galaxy Tab 3. Other devices like the Galaxy J5 and Galaxy A8 have also received Samsung’s version of the February security update. You can read the specific patch notes on the company’s website. It delivers key patches from Samsung and Google. Android Nougat Update As we’ve noted, the Samsung Galaxy Marshmallow roll out has been joined by Samsung’s new Android 7.0 Nougat update. The company’s official Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Android Nougat roll outs have begun though the release is limited to select models in select regions around the world. We expect that to change in the near future. Samsung’s promised several Nougat updates in the first half of 2017 and we expect all of these upgrades to deliver new features, tweaks and fixes for lingering Marshmallow issues. Devices like the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, and Galaxy Note 5 should be next in line for Samsung’s version of Android Nougat. For more information on the Android Marshmallow’s successor, take a look at our Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat roundup and our Android Nougat walkthrough. Samsung’s Android Nougat update will bump devices from Android 6.0.1 to Android 7.0. It’s not clear when or if Samsung will bump its devices to Android 7.1.1, the most up-t0-date version of Nougat. If you own a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge, we’ve put together a guide that will take you through the most important things to know about your update. If you own a Galaxy S6 or Galaxy Note 5, we’ve put together guides that will take you through the most exciting things about their release. 3 Reasons Not to Install Galaxy S7 Nougat & 6 Reasons You Should Install Nougat If You Want Better Security   1 / 9 Let's start with some basics. If you value your security, and most of you probably do, you'll want to think about installing the Galaxy S7 Nougat update soon after it arrives for your device.  Every month, Google and Samsung release important security patches for Android devices. The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Android Nougat updates should bring the latest security patches to your device. Samsung's initial batch of Galaxy S7 Nougat updates delivered the company's January security update while upcoming updates could deliver the patches from the February security update. You can read more about their contents on Samsung's website.  If you failed to download or receive Samsung's an older security update (December, November, etc), the patches from those updates might be baked into your version of Nougat. If not, you might be forced to install them manually before you can download Nougat.  On top of the patches, Samsung's Galaxy S7 Nougat update brings Samsung Pass, a way to secure your identity using biometric data rather than entering your password or ID.  Samsung Pass is like a master key for your various logins and it relies on Galaxy S7's fingerprint scanner. The biometric data is encrypted and stored safely by Samsung Knox.   1 / 9 359 Responses 01/06/2016 Ben Reply i dont see any difference in this version and what I am currently running on my S^ which I just got a few days ago. The hype and the hype over a few stupid changes is crazy. You guys in the media have to stop making things bigger than what they are, When a MAJOR change occurs, then hype and push it. Marshmallow is not a big deal. 01/12/2016 mnet Reply Marshmallow is hug Ben. It is huge because of the features you will get to control app permissions. The “wild west” days of Android apps with their crazy permissions is coming to an end. If you have not discovered all the features of 6.0 yet its because you have not looked into what is really there but instead troll the web. 03/05/2017 Sincose Line Reply Marshmallow is not working fine for many of the Samsung variants but of course after updating to Marshmallow from Lollipop, battery does not work as good as on Lollipop.

This update is about the marshmallow 6.0.1 and you must be talking about marshmallow 6.0 04/18/2016 William Ernst Reply The update sucks if you have an S5, as it has eliminated the feature that lets you transfer applications to the SD card 05/19/2016 Jamario Souza Reply The worst thing after this update is that I simply lost LTE connection. Only acces 3G. With Android 5 I could manage Network Band and select my prefered band, but now I have no access to it. In March it updated to Android 6.0, this month it updated to 6.0.1 and the shit continues. I cannot unlock phone using fingerprint after rebooting phone. It seems to me that Android M has taken a step backwards with my device.

Here’s what I’ve been doing>> USA Jobs Resort 04/14/2016 Robert Reply I disagree. I’ve had my S6 for several months on Lollipop, finally got the update to Marshmallow from Verizon a couple weeks ago and I’m really enjoying it. My S6 has much better battery life and it performs much better in benchmarks and normal use. It’s smoother (not as laggy), apps load faster, messaging is more streamlined (no more waiting to take and send pics through text), and total control of app permissions (finally). Marshmallow is a major update and I couldn’t be happier with it. It’s just a shame it took so long to actually get it. 06/21/2016 laurarussell532 Reply I found a great site that focuses on stay at home mom’s complete guide to gaining a serious amount of money in very little time.

If it’s not resolved within the two year update I’m moving to iOS. I rather deal with a company that updates regular and is more restrictive about what you can have than a company that takes months and months to update their devices. 01/11/2016 Taha Reply Chuck. Buying a nexus gives you instant apple style hardware and software updates. Cheers 01/12/2016 mnet Reply I agree with you to a point. But you have to ask yourself are you looking for updates for the sake of just getting something “new”? Most updates are minor, granted 6.0 is no minor update.

I think that it’s going to be another couple of months before I see it on my Note 4. But some great additions I didn’t expect…they’ve added scrolling screenshot functionality & the Edge is, at last amazing with half screen functionality and loads upon loads of Edge improvements. Battery life seems far better. I haven’t really dug in to fund everything yet, but so far as great improvement.

Had the S3, Note 10.1 (2012) and now Note 4 and always the same with lack of updates or extremely slow to update. Samsung needs to stop making dozens of devices with then dozens of variants of the same device! This is why they can’t update in a timely manner. If Google and Apple can make their device line up simple then so can Samsung! If Apple and Google can bypass carriers for updates and send them direct to users then so can Samsung. Until Samsung smartens up, they have lost me as a customer! Next phone will either be a Google Nexus device or (I hate to say and even think it but) iOS. I left Apple for Android but Google hates sd cards, all other manufacturers are slow to update. It’s ridiculous! Also the fact Samsung is removing the “adoptable storage” feature from their Android 6.0.1 updates is ridiculous! It’s a Google feature and Samsung and LG should have no right to remove/disable it. Give us the choice FFS! F U SAMDUNG! 02/25/2016 Too Squat Reply Note 4 owner…I think this is my last Samsung. I bought it because of the pen. Used to be an HTC buyer, they converted me to Android.

This is like reading the same thing over and over and over again. 4 months into Marshmellow and barely any devices have recieved it. Pathetic. Carriers suck with the added bloatware but it shouldn’t be this damn complicated. The real reason for the wait, S7 and S7 Edge. Gotta make sure as many people buy the latest and greatest before taking care of their actual customers first. Yes, its a business but wow…get the ball rolling Samsung or you’ll be losing about 100 people I know who’d love to try Apple.

Sir….. 02/29/2016 ThisGuyEntitledMuch Reply wow 02/29/2016 Charles Reply To the coders, thanks and all that… I’m sure that you busted a gut over this thing. but, Marshmallow doesn’t appear to be worth the risk of bricking your phone. You got Lollipop working ok.. You even dumped out a security patch. It works… It works well… The phone works as advertised. 6.0 and/or 6.0.1 for all the fanfare and hooplah… just doesn’t seem like it’s worth the risk. Maybe after 6.0.1 gets debugged… and/or maybe a 6.0.2 rolls out – or, maybe after the security fixes for it hit the bricks… It’ll be mature to a point where it’ll install and do what it’s supposed to do without doing any harm…. That could be a year away. Hell, there is even super hype blurting out over Android N… – and, they haven’t delivered 6.0.1… Why not talk about O and P while you’re at it…. There are still a lot of un-used letters in the alphabet. There is little or no talk about a USA release… thank god. It has to start out in S. Korea… and work its way west thru Bangladesh and Botswana. Sure, fine… brick pygmy phones if you have to. Don’t release the >1Gb bloat code here – until it works… It doesn’t even have to deliver the BS hype… just don’t brick my phone. and, If at all possible – don’t gut any useful functionality – that I had in Lollipop… We all know BS when we hear it. We know it won’t do all that you say it will do…. In short.. Do no harm… Don’t release an OS that is worse than the one we got. 02/29/2016 Bharath Reply Any chance of Touchwiz update on note 4? 03/01/2016 Young_Android_Runner Reply 29Feb2016 > Marshmallow isn’t here yet but we’re already hearing about a potential successor to the Marshmallow update Huh?

Third, the Settings aren’t all same like Galaxy S7. There is no triple-press home button for one-hand use feature. Fourth, Galaxy Labs is absent. Oh well, can’t think of more at the moment.

Clear all cache and see if it helps. It may be in settings or you may have to enter device recovery by turning it off then holding either the up or down volume while also holding power while it starts.

If you don’t have it and don’t care, you still didn’t need to post. Let us rant and why don’t you stay quiet? Samsuck is notorious for sending out upgrades late, thanks to their crappy touchwhiz garbage. They have to make sure the newest OS is working with that and thus it takes the longest. This is my first and last samsuck device, not only because of late OS updates (and N is right around the corner), but also because of their rapid charging mode. It wears out their batteries and people have to go buy new ones after about a year. My iPhone 5 that I gave my wife, I bought at launch and it is still working flawlessly on the same battery. My samsuck nope 4 is not holding the charge it once did because of its battery issue. I won’t be buying a new battery, however, I will be buying a new phone. And if I have to sell a kidney to afford and iPhone then so be it. 03/22/2016 Mathew Bolles Reply I received my update on my US Cellular S6 two days ago.

From what I can tell…. No one involved in the process seems to know what the process is. Supposedly, it is really rolling out some where… Botswana… Bangladesh… the Punjab in India. It is rolling of obscure tele-cos… with 10s of 100s of customers… The smaller the better. No projected or predicted or implied delivery dates have been met – any where. Those that got it – and, it worked – don’t seem to have a problem with it… even if it comes with its own completely new set of anomalies. Those that got it and it bricked their devices… simply disappear into non-digital existence. There seems to be some people that may or may not have it… that just love it to death. They are others seeing it as a cure for imagined ills. Then their are a few walking wounded that actually did get it… And, it didn’t deliver as promised. Bottom Line…. So far, it’s a huge non-event… and, that may be the good news… Some devices are skipping this promised land – for the next new – not quite there – version N. Which one must assume will be as nebulous as the nearly existent Marshmallow. This would all be a horrible fate if there was a problem with Lollipop to begin with. Fortunately, Lollipop isn’t all that bad. These promised improvements are like chasing mirages in the dessert… That can be a real problem if you are dying of thirst. The problem for the Android Overlords is that they can’t get any one thirsty for the new products…. Rumors, innuendos, and power of suggestion will only get you – but, so far. Plus, if you deliver one of these half-baked products – and, it bricks millions of devices… that a hell-of-a-lot of negative advertisement to get over. So, the latest update on the update… is that it is still kind of there but not there. No carrier has a completed roll out for all their devices. No device manufacturer has a completed roll out for all their makes and models on all carriers. There isn’t even a single device that is up and running on all carriers. It’s just one very specific make, model, – possibly even a specific block of serial numbers – within a model… pops up with a roll out on – one very specific carrier – usually some where outside the US. This is touted as progress…. Where – in comparison – Apple pulls a roll out and gets 80% of their products updated in a month… Still, ya have to admit…. Marshmallow is worth every penny ya paid for it. 03/24/2016 Jeffrey Gohlke Reply US Cellular S6 updated to 6.0.1 today 3-24-16 03/24/2016 Thersathomas Reply 203=1m­­­­­­­­­y neigh­­­­­­­­­bor’s mo­­­­­­­­­m m­­­­­­­­­akes $80 /h­­­­­­­­­r o­­­­­­­­­n th­­­­­­­­­e int­­­­­­­­­ernet .

If Wi-Fi is switched on, only the Play Store does not work. The Play Store works fine on LTE. All other Wi-Fi functions work fine. So I reset my device twice but no improvement.

What is the hold up, samsung??!?!?! Get on the ball, or hire some competent developers to get that update to everyone. This is ridiculous! 03/28/2016 Stan Reply I don’t think it’s too much too ask that Verizon, who are a multi-billion dollar empire, who rushed to be the first US player to update marshallow to Samsung’s phones ensure a safe install. The update BRICKED MY PHONE by not allowing it to charge. Even using a new battery didn’t work! I Have safely updated many phones and computers a million different ways. NEVER have I ever had an update DESTROY A device, let alone an $800 phone! The super messed up part is the take NO accountability for releasing software that can damage your phone.

However the update to 6.0.1 on the note 4 has a few issues so far, after the upgrade all my Bluetooth connections were wiped out and reconnecting is an issue because I have to reboot the phone and restart the headset 1 or 2 times before the phone sees the headset, I also found that one of tge greatest additions in marshmallows has been left out of the update and that is the theme engine, I mean really what sense does it make to leave out one of the best features, please put out an update that adds this feature back. Leaving out a major update at this stage of the game makes no sense at all. Guy’s get it fixed and get it right. 03/30/2016 Jay Reply Just got the 6.0.1 on my notes 5 sm – n920g 03/30/2016 Pamela Huff Reply My us cellular s6 edge plus updated to marshmallow a couple of weeks ago and I love it. Definitely some edge screen improvements but by far the most useful is having Google now right on top, no matter what page you’re on. 03/30/2016 Charles Reply As roll outs go… this is like standing in the middle of a turtle stampede. Sure, no one wants to rush anything… Why risk bricking your phone? The customers didn’t demand this. The customers aren’t really feeling the burn here… Yet, the vaguest reference of a siting in the most obscure of countries and the smallest of carriers – gets absurd pronouncements. It’ll happen when it happens. About the only good thing you can say about it – is – that it’s worth every penny you paid for it. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Here’s my 2¢. I’m glad my Note 4 got it as it is an update, it looks OK and works. I don’t like that Sammy took away the ability to move apps to the SD card and that I’ve gotta put the password in every time I reboot the phone. Other methods like fingerprint scan won’t work till after it’s fully rebooted via entering the password. I don’t think I’ve got extra emoji or wherever the modified battery saver was. It did come with a generous supply of Sprint/TouchWiz bloat as usual, but maybe a bit lighter by a few percentage points. I’m glad I didn’t pay for it though. And the next device for me will be called Nexus. See what you get for 2¢. :-P 03/30/2016 Wilson Reply After running the new update my S6 now randomly re-starts itself and I would say roughly half the phone calls are going directly to voicemail.

Too many issues to mention here. My phone is messed up! 03/31/2016 Charles Reply Here we are at the close of yet another month… March 31 – with Marshmallow market share resting comfortably at 2.3%… The pundits milestones fall by the wayside once again. and, They refuse to hold silence on their accolades for 6.0.1 – that barely exists… – and, where it does exist – there is no small amount of nashing of teeth. The pundits sell great snake oil…. btw… And, what’s wrong with snake oil – you might say. When was the last time you saw a squeaky snake? oh… well… There is always April – then May – then June…. Maybe some country some where with a sizable telecom – will roll this thing out and get it to work. Buyer be ware… If you got it “on” your new device – don’t panic… it’ll probably work just fine. Upgrading older devices – is always a bit of a crap shoot. If you bought older legacy hardware and update prior to loading your old apps…. that might work ok, too.. Marshmallow isn’t all that evil… It just can’t cope with all the possible combinations of footprints left over from old OS’s and legacy apps. Nothing ever has. Nothing ever will. The glacial roll out is probably a blessing – in that it is sparing you from the infinite new anomalies that you will encounter… The purported enhancements/improvements – may – or, may not – work as advertised. but, At least, you have gotten used to the quirks in your current device. Why suffer the trials and tribulations of different quirks – whilst Beta testing the lasted flavor. I guess that I long for the daze when one could stone false prophets. Back in the good ole daze, if the prophet spoke and got it wrong – they took him out to the gates of the city and stoned him… Not much of a retirement plan… But, it really cut down on people making idiot claims and speculations. 03/31/2016 Charles Reply Verizon has already inflicted/infected the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 users with Marshmallow…. Batteries dying… WiFi croaking… no access to the AppStore… BlueTooth disconnecting…. Who will be the next victim? Will they bless the 6s class? What did they ever do the Verizon… other than subscribe. The good news here – is – that as glacial as Android is with the updates, they aren’t all that essential. The updates sell features that you have never had… you are being told that you want them. Also… it’s great that it’s free… The update is worth every penny that you paid for it. So – not getting something that you don’t need and didn’t ask for – for money that you never paid… isn’t all that bad of a deal… Then Verizon steps in with its non-value added contribution. This slows the process even further. By the time Verizon is finished bloating the code, even more lettered releases appear on the horizon… N, O, P, etc. Which may displace the much exalted M – all together… and, Is that bad? You are still not paying for it. You still didn’t ask for it. You still don’t need it. So, does it ever matter, which version of the next shiny new OS that you aren’t actually getting? The hype seems totally unaffected. These are the same guys that barely got KitKat and Lolipop to stop coughing up blood… and, those two combined only pulled 37% of the market share for Samsung. Marshmallow is languishing at 2.3% – after 4 months. This is almost as much fun to watch as MicroSloth WinWoes rolling out their free WinWoes Tin…. 03/31/2016 Amy Sweet Reply Did the Marshmallow update and I can no longer lock my phone.

My update was just short of 1.4 GB. It has improved my Note by making it feel smoother and more intuitive. It seems to also be a bit lighter as in not so bloated, but I’m unable to confirm that as a fact. The only area I’m disappointed, and it’s a great disservice to us owners in my opinion, I no longer can move apps to the SD card. It’s not even accessable, as in moving apps to it, unless I’m missing something. This in my opinion is a real failure by Sammy. It just confirms my previous plan to go Nexus next time around. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Sorry for my redundancy at the end there. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply OK so there actually IS a way to transfer files from phone memory to a mounted SD card.

Learn where you do this on your particular phone as I don’t know about all is of them. I do know I did this to my Sammy Note 4 on Sprint and it helped with crashing apps after updating. Clear all cache. Then reboot. See if it helps. Hint: some devices have a setting menu for this, others you shut off the phone then get to the restore screen to clear cache.

Before, switching back and forth between fingerprint and nothing was super easy. Use fingerprints to identify, choose none, that’s it. Now it is fricken ridiculous and annoying as hell cause it asks for your backup password or code, then you select none, then it ALWAYS says cancel/delete fingerprints/keep fingerprints, even if you select keep fingerprints it asks for you to create a backup passcode TWICE which you already have!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Size: 1474.19 MB Version: N915PVPU4DPD1/N915PSPT4DPD1/N915PVPU4DPD1 · OS upgrade – Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow · To get the best from your device, please keep your phone up to date and regularly check for software updates. ※ Fingerprints are securely protected. An alternative unlock method (pattern, PIN, or password) is required to add fingerprints. ※ Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow does not support the Decrypt device function. If your mobile device is encrypted, encryption cannot be disabled after upgrading. If you want encryption to be disabled after upgrading, it must be disabled before you upgrade your device. To disable encryption go to Settings – Lock screen and security – Other security settings, then select Decrypt device. ※ If the Samsung Gear or Gear Fit Manager app does not work normally after this upgrade, uninstall the app, then install the latest version. This will reset your Gear to factory default settings and all data on your Gear will be erased. ※ Some apps that were installed via the Lollipop OS may need to be updated after upgrading to the Marshmallow OS. Go to Galaxy Apps or Play Store to update apps. 04/21/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow… 6.0.1 – over hyped… bloated… non-plused…. overall = not bad. For a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge+ / with Verizon, it’s not all that bad. My phone did not brick. My phone is not coughing up blood. The battery does not die… though – I’m not quite sure that the super enhanced improvement is there… The battery is doing ok.. not noticeably worse. The graphic depiction of projected duration is longer… I haven’t tried running it out to 12 hours yet… I don’t run enough BlueTooth peripherals to show a problem… It says its still there… I’m taking it at its word. The WiFi… may have had a problem – or, not…. The home WiFi didn’t skip a beat. The historical archive of pre-existing connections did ok, too… Scanning for potential – new – WiFis could be a problem – or, not… it could just work differently. I’ve had to re-register on a couple of hubs… So far, no big deal. The phone does not get mysteriously hot… or, cold… It does not randomly buzz, vibrate, reboot – or, speak in tongues. All the apps seem to have made it. The app store(s) are still there… — there is a special permission for non-PlayStore apps… Click a button and the Amazon apps, etc… are good to go. The GPS is doing ok. It appears to be doing every bit as well as the old Lollipop… It may be a schoosh faster – snappier. Schoosh…is a technical digital device term = barely noticeable. The user interface “is” slightly different… enough to annoy… I can’t see much of a wow factor in it. The “edge” feature is different… (? better ?)… It’s only better if you were a heavy user to begin with. If you had never bonded to the feature to begin with.. this probably isn’t going to get you anymore involved. So far, Marshmallow is a benevolent improvement. It has done no noticeable harm. I haven’t lost any capabilities. It may even be an improvement – overall. I can’t dodge the feeling that I am missing something… with all the fanfare, there should be some sort of wow-factor that justifies all the hype… Sometimes ya just have to take it as it is… at least, it didn’t set me back. I would recommend it – if I only knew – why? 04/21/2016 Elle Reply Thank you 04/22/2016 Lisa Miceli Reply UGH…not a fan of the update at all.

Like the notifications are gone, developer options says “it doesn’t work for this user”, multitasking app doesn’t work, home and back button is the only one the works. Please help. 05/02/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow 6.0.1 doesn’t seem to be all that bad…. Eventually, it automatically downloaded, then the annoying window was there for about a week every time you unlocked the screen. I finally consented for it to install… (Verizon Samsung Galaxy s6 edge plus) It blinked and buzzed… blinked some more.. went dark… for awhile… lit back up… did some more blinking… buzzed…. – after a bit, it looked like it was gunna actually do sumthun… The start screen lit up and it jingled its jangle… Then there was much flashing and an occasional buzz…. Once it finished convulsing, I went for a shut down, which it did. After a few moments of calm, I started it back up again. This time it started with less fan fare… about as quickly as Lollipop… It still wanted to do some tweaking… So, for the first half hour or so – it was clunky. Whatever the upgrade is – it takes time to digest. Over the following week or so… mileage has varied. Nothing bad… = but, no wow factor either. The battery usage is some where between psychotic and bewildering. Sometimes it predicts 8 hours… sometimes 3 days. There are weird slopes in the discharge curve, which effect the battery life prognostications. It may depend on signal strength, whether or not WiFi is enabled… and/or the strength of the WiFi signal.. It may also be effected by back ground app updates and the relative signal strengths during those processes.. and, There may be god knows what going on with apps optimizations. I have not let this thing go for 3 days and attained the promised duration… Before I could get 8hr, 12hrs… maybe 16 hrs… before an auto shut down. The best to date with marshmallow – I’ve gotten down to around 30 – 40% in power savings mode in about 22 hrs…. which is an improvement. I just don’t know if I can believe it. The digital services seem to be a bit snappier, quicker. No big difference with calls, gps, bluetooth, or WiFi… The searching and notifications of “new” WiFi signals may be different – but, the devices seems to connect to the old connections – ok. Basically, It hasn’t screwed much of anything up…. I have a very undemanding regimen for the device. What I had it doing – it still does, which is all I asked for. The new “can’t live without features” – eh… just not all that into them, yet. They aren’t bad… I bought the edge plus for the bigger screen – not so much for the edge technology. There’s nothing wrong with it… just wasn’t a big deal to begin with. With all the tapping, dragging, swiping, pinching, spreading… another way of doing the same stuff just adds another layer of confusion to the process… Still, the edge stuff works… The edge bar is bigger.. If I used it, it would be helpful. I can definitely say, that it was worth every penny I paid for it. It has done no damage. No data lost. No performance lost. No functionality lost. The learning curve for the new features is negligible. This positions the device to take advantage of new features in my existing apps. So far – so good…. It may be a benefit for battery usage and charging It will probably be better on my Samsung Galaxy Tab s2… 05/02/2016 Dustin Hall Reply My S6 updated to Marshmallow this morning and I’m getting all these errors: messaging app totally not working, laggy overload for every app, not recognizing my thumbprint, battery draining exceptionally fast.

I am an AT&T customer and like many of you I have been awaiting the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update, but I have been waiting for it for very different reasons. Some owners of the phone may be waiting for it for the same reasons as well. Here is the problem:   Since the internet released that AT&T rolled out the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update overseas, Google App vendors have been upgrading their softwares for the Note in anticipation of the Marshmallow Platform Update. If you are like me and you have been paying attention, these Google Play Apps update sometime 1 to 5 times weekly. With the updates being installed, the phone begins to freeze in certain applications. The phone may allow you close out the application so you may relaunch it, but in my instance this also means removing the battery cover (waiting for a time) and restarting the device. The reason I have now been told 5 times by AT&T tech reps is that the phone has not been updated with the software needed to support the updated Apps. So basically, between 1 to 6 times daily my device freezes.   Now, when I became upset about this was when I was told to upgrade to a new device, instead of being told when the Marshmallow Update would be released. Basically, my device is acting like it has a virus but is actually working as intended but is having a problem with software in Apps versus Platform issue. This meant I was being told upgrade a perfectly good working phone when there was nothing actually wrong with it. I got to thinking about how many AT&T customers are being told this, who may not be asking the right questions and I became even angrier, as they are throwing money at the company for a problem that is easily fixed:   1.       Either they indicate the Galaxy Note 4 is not going to be upgraded in the US, which causes vendors to stop notifying your phone to upgrade Apps. 2.       Or, they upgrade the phone to Marshmallow Software in the US post haste.   Basically I am outlining a very poor customer service issue. This is either due to AT&T’s negligence, Samsung’s negligence, or Googles. When you call to speak with anyone about this, they point the finger elsewhere as the problem. Warranty sent me a refurbished device to see if it will work better for me. It is on its way. I doubt it will, because of the issues I have been having. I thought I would pass this along to encourage all with a Galaxy Note 4 to call AT&T if you have been told to upgrade your device unnecessarily.   I upgrade, normally to a new phone 1x a year. As a present to myself on my birthday. This is the first time I did not upgrade as I was not happy with the lack of expandable memory in the Note 5. So I kept the phone. So now almost 2 years later, I am having all of these problems with a perfectly good phone and due to lack of SOFTWARE SUPPORT.  I hope me explaining this issues helps address your problem if you are having the same issue yourself. I encourage you to complain. Perhaps this will induce them to release the software, or finally release that they have no intention of doing so. Which also fixes the problem. 05/16/2016 Eric Johnson Reply Very nicely said. You brought out all the problems I was having. After I read your very long message, I was really with on most points. My final thought was I’m going to have to complain and complain. So like you said, complain about these issues were having. Maybe, just maybe that will work. Let’s hope that works. 05/11/2016 Shanna Hall Reply My Galaxy S6 Says That It Is Up to date But My Phone Is Still On lollipop. I haven’t even gotten the option to get marshmallow yet.

Most Samsung’s still run lollipop, while I run the new modern OS Android 7 which came via an OTA as soon as I got my lg nexus which runs pure Android not some dodgy rip off touch wiz crap. Samsung’s owners are some of the last to ever get updates even smaller brands already have marshmallow out of the box. I also get updates before any other brand for the life of the phone not for a limited time like none Google branded phones.

In March it updated to Android 6.0, this month it updated to 6.0.1 and the shit continues. I cannot unlock phone using fingerprint after rebooting phone. It seems to me that Android M has taken a step backwards with my device. 05/19/2016 Samba Samm Reply when is it coming to Brazil? 05/20/2016 Donna Dunn Reply I do not like the Yahoo news feed.

Carrier: Vodafone UK. 05/20/2016 Marcome Yates Reply I did the AT&T update for S6 Edge and I noticed the battery drains faster since the update. Reminds me of when I updated my S4 to Lollipop and battery life sucked. I don’t want to try a factory reset. I tried that once with my S4 and it never helped.

I understand all the tweets and wrinkles need to be ironed out but seriously I feel there is something being manipulated behind the AT&T curtain. 05/23/2016 Andy Reply Marshmallow on T-Mobile Galaxy S5 is downloading right now on my device! Stills says “T-Mobile Testing” on T-Mobile website though…so, probably a phased roll out. 05/23/2016 Charles Reply I would have preferred to have gone with Marshmallow in the Tab s2 first… The Galaxy s6 edge plus… is no big deal… At least, it didn’t go completely psychotic. The battery blather… – all the hype about improved battery performance – is a bit weird. The prognostications as to when it will die are all over the place. Sometimes it thinks that it can run for daze on the existing charge… sometimes just 6 to 8 hours… It “does” seem to re-charge faster. It doesn’t seem to be overheated when it does so. So far, it has been benevolently benign…. No lost data… No lock ups. It still works about like it did with Lolipop… I have noticed an occasional re-boot, on its own.. No boot loops. Some apps are a bit snappier and faster… some aren’t… some are the same. It could just be the calm before the storm… The chargers, the cables, the device hardware and OS have come into temporary alignment. We all know that it won’t last…. Sooner or later 5G will drop… = new hardware, new chargers and new cables… the OS will be gawd knows what by then. Enjoy it while it lasts. 05/26/2016 Jens Reply Woke up this morning to a 1500 plus mb download yay think I finally got the note 4 update from bell in Canada Hope it’s not just a security update. 05/26/2016 Steve Reply Got an update on Galaxy S6 last night. It updated fine and seemed to work ok. However, it appears to have disabled the ability to charge. By morning the plugged in phone had dropped to 0%. When unplugged it crashed and will no longer charge or boot. Told by Sprint tech they would have to factory reset. Sprint obviously doesn’t do any testing on their OTA software updates! 05/28/2016 Benjamin Reply I have the Note 4 (Through AT&T) and they have yet to release it on mine.

This seems to be due to some sort of security feature which I hope can be overcome by either Android or Facebook. 06/03/2016 Hussein farouk Reply What about middle east countries 06/03/2016 Faith Reply Am in south africa , when ca we receive Samsung galaxy A7 2016 edition 06/03/2016 Wally Reply My wife and I both have Galaxy S5 with Verizon in the United States, and the Marshmallow update pushed out today! 06/05/2016 Michel Klearman Reply Since the update, my Galaxy 6 has gone crazy!

Samsung Galaxy series with Marshmalow OS are always my first choice in the current market. The features in its new updates are even more attractive than ever. Thanls for the info. 06/16/2016 Patrick Reply Yes AT&T sucks in many was, but as far as the Marshmallow update goes, Samsung has not released Marshmallow for some U.S models. I was anticipating my phone to update in June, but AT&T claims they have not received some Marshmallow updates from Samsung. June is not over, but AT&T will probably take their sweet time sending to phones under their umbrella. 06/16/2016 Alan Reply Samsung s stinks as does att. Note 5 June 16th still no update. I’m thinking about going back to Apple after a decade of this crap 06/19/2016 Phienyx Reply Have they fixed the feature where the LED blinks for unviewed notifications yet? … or is this still not been acknowledged or addressed? 06/23/2016 AJ Reply Samsung as a company should be so ashamed of how they manage all their device updates.. It is clear from that the postings on this article and hundreds like it that they are losing millions of phone sales to apple because of this reason alone. Make less models but keep them updated for min 5 years and you will have loyal supporters not careful ones. PS: return every feature you lost from Note 4 (inc it), make it waterproof and I’ll buy it always. 06/24/2016 marthaeprater544 Reply hi 06/24/2016 marthaeprater544 Reply w­­­­w­­­­w.u­­s­­a­­t­­o­­d­­a­­y.n­­y­­p­­o­­s­­t­­5­­5­­.­­c­­o­­m 06/24/2016 marthaeprater544 Reply I ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­make ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­$86 ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­hourly ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­on ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­the ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­computer. ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­I ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­have ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­been ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­without ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­work for ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­six ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­months ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­Hey you guys I have found the perfect job as a full time student, it has changed my life around!

Why not AT&T? What are AT&T’s plans for rolling out Marshmallow on their Note Edge models (SM-N915A)? 07/09/2016 Jonathan Reply Got the update on my WiFi only Tab S2 and it’s nothing but problems. One user is completely locked out because the fingerprint scanner won’t work and it will not recognize the backup password. The primary user keeps getting an “update security policy/set up fingerprint security” bullshit popup every single time the damn thing is unlocked, so have had to disable security on that user account. On top of that the tablet is often running a lot slower. So far I don’t see any benefits. 07/14/2016 strauss44 Reply Received my Android 6.0.1 today in Canada, via broadband cable from Shaw cable, then by inhouse WiFi to my Samsung Galaxy Tab A. It installed without incident and all apps appear to work fine. Only about six Apps needed updating, and did so on next rebot. All I can tell is essentially cosmetic changes. It does appear that browsers Opera and Firefox run slightly faster.

Mashmallow,go get toasted. You have caused my phone to overheat, slow its connection to almost anything, freeze so I can’t see my unlock pattern with the keyboard constantly coming up on my Homecreen. Finally the best bit, I always clean out old apps and crap to stop security issues and the CPU slowing down, and I no tech geek. So I should get more than five hours out of a battery charge, when all I doing is leaving it switched on? Samsung – Happy for you to send me a new phone. Otherwise I have no choice but to revive my old Galaxy 4. Kinda sux after paying it off over 12 months. 08/12/2016 Shereen Reply I did my update on Galaxy A5 and love the look. I just have a few concerns, I have checked all my settings and I don’t have restricted data active and my whatsapp come through only when I am in wifi or when I go into whatsapp. This wasn’t like this before I did the update. Not sure what went wrong. I also noticed that when I go into my gallery it hangs before showing me the folders so I can view my photos. 08/13/2016 Mrticklesz Reply Its because they’re trying to sell their new products which is no any different than the note 4.. damn you samsung! 08/14/2016 Dee Reply Still no marshmallow for Galaxy Alpha… 08/18/2016 Dwan Sadler Reply Why didn’t the Sprin’ts Marshmallow update come with video calling? ATT, Verizon, and T-Mobile all have Samsung video calling S M H 08/23/2016 fux Reply Galaxy Alpha – waiting is the hardest time! 08/23/2016 Charles Reply ??? Lollipop worked ??? Marshmallow worked. The security patch worked… Worked = didn’t brick the phone. Differences in performance = negligible. Additional features almost unnoticeable. Improvements = possibly… then again – maybe not. At least, this stuff does no harm… and, It’s worth every penny ya paid for it…. Will the next security fix – really – fix anything… It won’t matter. The guys out there hacking code are so far ahead of the security patches – that they aren’t loosing sleep over the security patches. The security patches only patch found leaks anyway. Will Nougat fix the security issues… = probably not… but, it will make life difficult enough on the device owners to make them think that security has improved.. The hackers are way ahead of the process. They’ll have Nougat leaking while it’s still in beta. So.. we will get yet another candy flavor – this year… That will fulfill our un-expressed desires… They’ll add stuff that we didn’t ask for, telling us that we can’t live without it. They’ll sell it as a security necessity, whilst working on all the dozens of known security compromises. And, roll out a bug fix / security patch weeks after they drop the barely out of beta Nougat. All this does not matter to me. I’m in this for the damn phone. So long as I can make calls / receive calls – I’am ok with all the update/patch bull$hit… Just don’t brick the phone. 08/25/2016 sadsds Reply who can tell me when malaysia will get marshmallow update for galaxy a8(-a800f)? 08/26/2016 Ray Reply I just got the Marshmallow update for my AT&T S5 today.

I also just received the update for the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 tablet. I’m glad they supported this tablet but they clearly did as minimal work as possible. There’s almost no visible change whatsoever. No change in notifications or app drawer at all. Some very slight changes in the Settings menu and that’s about it. I am eager to try bonding the SD card with the main storage memory though as the 16 GB tablets have never cut it. 09/12/2016 MarshmallowForcedFacortyReset Reply I was woken up this morning around 1:30 to my phone making the tmobile sound. I get up and it said the update failed, I selected to have it try again and it forced a factory reset on my phone. All my contacts and out of my 200+ contacts I have 11 now. None of my bookmarks for internet browsers are there. I can’t seriously be the only one. I have a Samsung J7, model number SM-7J00T, and I’m in Washington State. Even things some of the things I had saved on my SD card got wiped. So you can imagine I’m beyond many colorful expressions, especially with the line of work I’m in and the fact I’m also in school right now. I’ve lost so many points of contact where phone was the only form of communication I had with people and I have no way of reaching out. 09/21/2016 Mooney Reply This is good one. 09/21/2016 Mooney Reply See …!Super and Easiest 0nl!nee Home opportunity for all. make 87 Dollars per hour and Make 2512 Dollars per month.All you just Need an Internet Connection and aComputer To Make Some Extra cash.

Google’s flagship device will face competition from the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy S8, Apple’s iPhone 8 and LG’s G6. But the device’s main rival in the market will definitely be the Galaxy S8. Both companies will have a lot to prove with their devices. While the Galaxy S8 is Samsun's first major device post the Galaxy Note 7 scandal, the Pixel 2 — as it is expected to be called — is Google’s chance to build on the initial success of the Pixel device. It also presents a chance for Google to improve on the hardware and software flaws that the device suffered from despite its initial success. Let’s see how the two devices stack up against each other in terms of specs: Performance Both the Google Pixel 2 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 are expected to come with a 10nm technology based Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. While Samsung has the entire supply of the processor reserved for the S8, which is expected to launch in March or April, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to release in October 2017, there is a fair chance that the company gets its hands on the processor. Display The Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to come in 5-inch and 6-inch models, while Pixel series 2 is also expected to have a similar lineup. While the edge-to-edge display for the Samsung Galaxy S8 is mostly confirmed, according to Pocket Lint, if Google wants to compete with the major flagships in the market, it will have to endow its Pixel 2 device with one. While Samsung is expected to go for a display-embedded fingerprint sensor for the S8, Google is expected to continue with the rear-mounted one on the current Pixel device. Camera According to Sammobile, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to come with a dual-camera setup comprising of a 12-megapixel camera sensor accompanied by a 13-megapixel one, which will help create a better depth of field in images. Google will have much to build on for its Google Pixel 2 handset since its current device has been rated as the best smartphone camera yet by DxO Mark. According to 9to5 Google, the company is currently developing a camera lens, which could have an improved low-light condition performance. In addition to this, both devices are also expected to have waterproof bodies. While Samsung already espouses the standard in its existing device – the Samsung Galaxy S7, Google is expected to endow its Pixel 2 device with either an IP67 or IP68 certified body, according to Trusted Reviews. While the Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to have a price tag of $899, the Google Pixel 2 is expected to be launched later in October at $649.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive Google Takes "Actions" Sunday Mar 5, 2017 at 6:00 AM By Bob and Joy Schwabach When extra features are added to cell phones or the Internet, they're called "apps" - short for "applications." Maps and games are examples. When features are added to the new fast-growing digital assistants like Amazon Echo, they're called "skills;" but when added to Google Home, they're called "actions." Why the difference? We don't know, and we didn't make this stuff up. You have to realize that dozens of meetings, attended by high-powered executives, are required to make such decisions. We weren't invited. Well, these gizmos are the fastest-growing products on the planet, just ahead of organic carrot juice. And so we looked at what "actions" Google can take. Users of either device most often ask for weather or music. But what about more difficult questions, like: "Tell me about Tokelau." This is an island in the middle of the Pacific, halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, and we are always anxious for news. Currently, there's not much happening on Tokelau, and so there's no news. But other interesting actions are popping up all the time. Here are some we've tried so far. • "Quora." This is our favorite question and answer site. There are more than 100 million active daily users, and they can provide answers to really obscure questions. For instance, we asked Google Home to launch Quora, and then asked: "What is the best way to lower cholesterol for a blood test?" Google said the best answer was from Joy Schwabach, who has answered lots of questions on Quora and has 140,000 views. This turns out to be the same Joy Schwabach whose name is on our column. (How many could there be?) The answer she gave is rather lengthy and somewhat boring, so we won't go into it. We might note that no one pays for this information. • "Random Conversations." This enormously useful "action" allows you to say just about anything and someone out there in the great beyond will say something back. For example, a stranger asked us what we did when lonely or bored. We had much to say on this subject, but unfortunately we cut her off accidentally. • "Lonely Planet" – You mention an area of the world you're interested in, like Italy, and get news of attractions. A follow-up email gives you more detail on whichever one you want to know about. We learned about the Museum of San Marco in Florence. • "Cool Events" tells you about meetups and shows in your area. Unfortunately, the first one they told us about had already started an hour earlier. Ah well, a few bugs to work out. • In "Animal Quiz," your Google Home device will ask questions and try to guess the animal you're thinking of. When we tried it, Google failed to guess "turkey." • "Genius" just gives you information about songs. (It's a very limited genius.) It didn't recognize "The Star Spangle Banner," our national anthem, and told us it was probably an album by Jay Z and Kanye West. Seems unlikely. • "And Chill" offers movie recommendations. We said we liked "Sleepless in Seattle" for its romance, and it said we might like "Man Up," "Mr. Nobody," "Revolutionary Road" and several others. Never heard of them. • "Reverse Math." You're given an answer, such as 90, and have to think of three numbers that when multiplied together get that. How about nine, ten and one? That was easy. There are nearly a hundred of these actions to choose from. (The other gadget, Amazon Alexa, by the way, has 8,000.) To find what's available, tap the Google Home app on your phone, then "more settings," then "services." Some are remarkably specific, such as the dates and hours for Seattle's public swimming season, the lunch menu at St. Joseph's school (they didn't bother to say which St. Joseph’s school, and there are dozens), and the public transportation schedule in Prague. "Mr. Doggy" tells you what's safe for your dog to eat. (Food, we would guess.) There's no search function, you have to scroll through them all. By the way, we’ve often read that Google Home is better than the Amazon Echo or Echo Dot in answering questions, but it’s a mixed bag. Alexa told us that Spain was bigger than Sweden, but Google Home said it didn’t know. Sometimes Google knows but Alexa doesn’t. On the other hand, when you’re looking for Alexa’s new skills, rather than go through all 8,000, you can search by topic. Internuts • StrangeUSA.com says it’s the ultimate collection of the strange. Click on a U.S. state, then a city. We tried Joy’s old hometown of Newport Beach, California. One of the items said the Coronado Apartments, where her nephew lives, is haunted by the spirit of a woman. Lights go on and off, muffled voices are heard, and phantom music emanates. (They just don't understand the erratic power system in Newport Beach.) They said John Wayne’s yacht in the Bay is haunted by John Wayne. (Bob has been on this boat and didn't hear a peep. He says it's more likely he haunts the airport, which he hated.) • KhanAcademy.org has thousands of courses. A new one is "Pixar in a Box." You learn how the people behind "Toy Story," "Up" and "Inside Out" create their movies. • "Big Dogs, Little Kids." Google that phrase. These are the really cute. • "How to Use Steve Jobs' Insanely Simple Strategy For Getting What You Want." Google this phrase to find an article in Inc. Magazine that includes a video clip of Steve Jobs, Apple co-founder, explaining his strategy. As a 12-year-old, he called up the president of Hewlett Packard, who offered him a summer job.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Technology Smartphones Google Pixel 2 coming this year, confirms company A senior Google official said the upcoming Pixel device would be a premium-tier model. By Sarmistha Acharya March 5, 2017 10:27 GMT Google will bring out a successor to its Pixel series handsetIBTimes UK Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of hardware at Google, has confirmed the Pixel smartphone will get its successor. Osterloh in a recent interview with Android Pit said: "There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it. You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now." Like the current Pixel and Pixel XL, the upcoming models would also sit among premium devices in the market, said Osterloh, adding: "Pixel stays premium." Although he did not provide details about the specific launch time, he said there would be no Pixel budget model. Prior to this confirmation, last month Google said it will not stop production of Pixel devices in response to rumours that the company would cease production of its Pixel lineup. "We're really excited by the demand for the Pixel XL in Canada. Telus is currently out of stock of the Pixel XL. We're working with our partners to restock inventory across our retail channels and we can confirm that production of the Pixel has not stopped," the company told 9to5Google in a statement. Rumour suggests that the upcoming Pixel dubbed Pixel 2 is expected to receive significant improvements to the camera and processor. The company is said to be working on some low-light photo feature. The phones would "not have large MP size", instead "compensate in extra features".

Telefonica’s O2 unit — one of the first mobile operators in Britain to offer car insurance — expanded its product line in February to include telematics boxes, which track people’s driving habits and can lead to cheaper premiums for youngsters. That’s stoking speculation that a wave of fintech companies will push into the market and disrupt the way insurers interact with customers. Cell-phone or Internet companies could, for example, use the massive amount of data they hold on their customers to sell them car insurance, bypassing traditional brokers and price-comparison websites. Alphabet’s Google entry into price comparisons last year failed, but analysts say the web giant could come back and have another go. “No doubt Google will figure out a way to come back,” said Christopher Ling, a regional leader at Capgemini SA’s insurance practice for the UK and Europe in London. “For O2, it’s more dipping a toe in the water at the moment. Other ideas could be using mobile-phone data for home and health monitoring and the insurance associated with that.” Google did not respond to requests for comment. The insurance industry has long feared the entry of companies such as Google, Amazon.com or Facebook which have a closer relationship to customers — and above all better data on them. The potential disruption to the market is adding to pressure on providers already seeing their investments hurt by record-low interest rates. Insurers are reacting to the challenge. Allianz Chief Executive Officer Oliver Baete has pledged to make Europe’s biggest insurer “digital by default” to help boost productivity and retain clients. Thomas Buberl, CEO of Axa, told investors last year that “customers are now used to buying things at Amazon to interact with Google and Facebook, they are demanding the same from us and, as you can imagine, buying an insurance policy at Axa is not yet quite the same as buying a book at Amazon.” O2 has jumped into “what is undoubtedly a very competitive market,” said Mark Evans, CEO of Telefonica’s UK unit. It plans to use technology “to identify driver behavior and therefore incentivize very attractive packages for those who drive responsibly.” Telefonica also offers car insurance in Spain and has offered products in the UK since 2015. Partner up Fintech companies are already a growing, if limited, part of the global market: 173 start-ups focusing on insurance got funding last year compared with 122 in 2015, according to venture-capital researcher CB Insights. The key for any newcomer will be finding the right partner, Capgemini’s Ling said. O2’s insurance business operates through a tie-up with Peterborough-based insurer BGL Group Ltd., which is also behind insurance offerings by companies including UK funeral care to supermarkets operator Co-Operative Group and roadside-assistance company RAC. “The market for UK consumer insurance has always been incredibly competitive and another one in the mix certainly won’t help the margins,” said Ben Cohen, a London-based analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “It remains to be seen how new entrants in the insurance market grapple with data-privacy issues.” Shock suggestion Citigroup analysts provided a wake-up call for the insurance industry a year ago when they suggested Google’s parent should buy insurer American International Group and turn it into a laboratory for innovation, possibly using the tech company’s client data to set policy prices. Alphabet shut down its Google Compare service, which included insurance, in 2016 after the site failed to generate substantially more revenue that standard search ads for the products, the Wall Street Journal reporter at the time. But Baidu Inc., Google’s Chinese equivalent, and hedge-fund firm Hillhouse Capital Management Ltd. formed a venture with Allianz in 2015 to provide digital-insurance services in the Asian nation. “Monetizing mobile data is an incredibly exciting proposition,” Capgemini’s Ling said. “Other people will start to realise the potential of that in the same way as Google has realised the potential of monetising Internet traffic.” < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

It goes without saying that Google won’t rest on its laurels and that we can expect the company to follow up on the Pixel and Pixel XL‘s successor. The company’s head of hardware Rick Osterloh and confirmed that the company is going to release a 2017 Pixel smartphone in the coming months and that it’s going to be a premium device much like its predecessors. To be fair, no one expected Google to add a mid-range or entry-level handset to the Pixel lineup just yet. So Osterloh’s confirmation that the 2017 Pixel phone is going to be premium is just like reaffirming your faith in the blueness of the sky. Osterloh also mentioned in his conversation with the folks over at AndroidPIT that Google isn’t interested in adding a low-cost option to the Pixel lineup just yet and that the existing ecosystem of hardware vendors is doing a fine job of offering mid-range and entry-level options. He didn’t really confirm anything about the new Pixel handsets, though, but it’s expected that Google will follow up with two models this year as well. We’ll likely hear more about the new Pixel smartphones in the weeks and months to come. Don’t expect these handsets to arrive before fall. Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Google, Google Pixel.

In contrast, it can be a lot more difficult to discover what your offline reputation is. It doesn’t matter what type of business you have these days – it can be online or offline, large or small – there will still be information about you online. Therefore, you should be aware you’re your online reputation is and manage it. Here are eight reasons why. Most people will ‘Google you’ before buying You know you do it so, of course, most others do it too. If you want information on a business or product, you search on Google to see if you can find it. You don’t care if it’s a local business or not – you go to Google, type in the name, and then you read the reviews and other information about that business. When you do Google an individual the first listings you usually find about them are their Facebook and LinkedIn profiles. People buy from those they trust Finding good information during the search process helps build a feeling of trust with your potential customer. If, instead, they find bad information, poor ratings, or other things about you or your business that is negative, they may choose a competitor. Reputation builds brand awareness By building an online reputation through the use of social media, websites, blogs, YouTube videos and more, you will build brand awareness. If you do it right, it will build positive brand awareness about yourself and your business. But, if you do it wrong you might inadvertently make yourself look bad. Focus on always being positive and not negative unless, of course, that is your personal brand. Good reputation gives a competitive advantage The aim is to build such a good reputation that when someone searches for your name, a search term, or your product or industry, you appear in the searches in a healthy way without controversy. In this way, you’ll have an advantage over your competitors who either don’t exist online or have a bad reputation. Nothing is a secret anymore One thing you have to accept about our new technological world is that nothing is secret any more. You cannot be anonymous online if you expect to make an impact with your business. Instead you need to be yourself, taking control of your reputation by making an appearance on discussion boards, blogs, podcasts or YouTube video. Even if you have one negative event, you can ensure that the positive outweighs the negative if you make the right effort. Customers care about your values In the old days, everyone cared more about the bottom line than their reputations as employers or corporations. Today, people want to know about the individuals they will deal with. If you support charities or local causes, you should talk about it as the publicity will benefit both the cause and yourself. Many consumers want to buy from people who care about the local area, the environment or causes they are interested in. Competitors may try to trash You By keeping an eye on and working to improve your online reputation, when and if a competitor tries to trash you, you’ll be ready. These days it is very easy for someone to quickly put a negative comment online rather than deal directly with you on whatever the issue might be. Unscrupulous competitors might even hire people to do poor product reviews, or do one themselves, and call you out on things that aren’t true just to make you look bad. How you respond makes all the difference and you should respond. Every action you take for better or worse affects your reputation One thing you have to accept about running a business now is that everything you has the potential to be analysed and scrutinised by everyone. It’s imperative that before you post anything you consider how it will impact your future. Before you spout off to a rude customer on social media, consider how you can turn it around in a way that is positive because, even if you’re ultimately right, how you respond matters. Building and maintaining your online reputation is an important way to build your brand, improve your business, and make a difference. So, go on and Google yourself now and see what you can find – you might be surprised.

The device will likely to get launched in the second-half of 2017. By: Tech Desk | Updated: March 5, 2017 1:29 pm Google Pixel will be getting a sequel in 2017, and it’s going to be a premium phone. Looks like Google Pixel 2 is coming, after all. That’s according to Rick Osterloh, who heads up Google’s hardware division. During an interview, Osterloh told AndroidPIT that Google Pixel will be getting a sequel in 2017, and it’s going to be a premium smartphone. Talking to the website, Osterloh is quoted as saying: “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it… “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” The executive confirmed that there will be a new Pixel smartphone, but he didn’t specify when it will going to hit the market. Watch all our videos from Express Technology There have been reports in the media claiming Google to launch a low-end Pixel smartphone in the market.  However, Osterloh confirmed that the company will stay in the top-tier, premium segment. That means Google will not going to launch an affordable Pixel smartphone in the near future. This isn’t surprising considering the Pixel devices are aimed at the upper segment, where Apple continues to perform exceptionally well with its iOS devices. Also read: Google asks for feedback on the design of Pixel smartphones The Pixel 2 rumour mill is heating up especially as 2017 will mark the release of the second-generation smartphone. The Pixel and Pixel XL were announced and released in October 2016, so we’re now anticipating the release of the Pixel 2. As of now, we still don’t know much about the Pixel 2, but we can expect the device to be way better than its predecessor. We can assume it will have a curve bezel-less design, Snapdragon 835 processor, 6GB RAM, and again come with a non-expandable internal storage. It’s being said that the Pixel 2 will feature a waterproof design for the first time. Plus, the second-generation Pixel smartphone will get improved camera optics. In addition, Google Pixel 2 might be the first smartphone to run Android 8.0 Oreo, the next version of the Android mobile OS. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Google Election 2017 UP polls 2017: In his last appeal, Modi talks jobs, empowerment for farmers UP polls 2017: In this village of soldiers, families that lost sons can’t agree on Army and strikes UP elections 2017: At ghats, they revel in arguing about Ganga, politics and Modi Best of Express SportsIndia level series 1-1 with 75-run win over Australia in Bangalore Test EntertainmentNoor trailer: Sonakshi Sinha says Mumbai is killing her.

This is why to get the best out of your camera and to achieve the look that you want, manually choosing the right white balance instead of selecting “auto” is a good idea. However not everyone is so savvy when it comes to adjusting their camera settings or choosing the right white balance, but the good news is that Google Photos wants to take some of the guesswork away for you. According to Google, it seems that Google Photos will now be able to automatically correct your photos’ white balance. According to Google, “Now, when you open the photo editor in Google Photos and select a look, we’ll not only correct exposure and saturation, we’ll also automatically correct the white balance in the image.  And if you want to tweak it even more, just go into Color and adjust the Warmth and Tint.” Of course this isn’t saying that Google’s algorithms are 100% accurate, but basically if you have no idea on how to post-process your photos or use the more advanced tools, this should help out a bit. The feature should already be live so fire up the app, edit some photos and see how it treats you. Filed in General. Read more about Apps, Google and google photos.

Just recently in December, it was reported that a malware called 'Gooligan' breached accounts of more than a million users. Now, a bizarre new type of malware has been detected in around 132 apps in Google Play that had the ability to affect Windows users, according to a security firm. Palo Alto Networks discovered the malware-ridden apps and reported them to Google to have them removed from Google Play. The Internet security team in a blog post said that the apps, which were developed by several different people, managed to hide HTML-based iframe tags. The iframe tags, which are generally used to embed external elements in a webpage, like a YouTube video, was also loading elements from malicious domains. In one case, an app didn't use iframe but Microsoft's Visual Basic language to load malicious code into the app. In the report, Palo Alto Networks traces the infected apps to a common geographical location even though the developers are unrelated. Most of the apps are said to originate from Indonesia, since the country's name was attached to the names of the apps. "One common way HTML files have been infected with malicious iframes has been through file infecting viruses like Ramnit. After infecting a Windows host, these viruses search the hard drive for HTML files and append iframes to each document. If a developer was infected with one of these viruses, their app's HTML files could be infected," the report notes. The reports goes on to suggest that the malicious nature of the apps was not intentional and that the developers simply did not realise that their apps' HTML files were infected when uploading their apps to Google Play. Furthermore, the purpose of the malware was to load interstitial ads and the main malicious applications, elaborates Ars Technica. These Windows-specific malware were downloaded from domains that have long since been disabled. So while the apps themselves aren't a threat on Android devices, it still raises concerns on Google's app screening process, and why it failed to identify the infected apps.       LATEST STORIES (22) Iraqi Forces Retake Turkish Consulate Building in Mosul after Nearly 3 Years Under ISIL US Starts Deploying THAAD System in South Korea Rights Groups: New Trump Travel Order Remains Muslim Ban Iraq Security Forces Take Mosul’s Main Government Complex, Museum Building Russian Soldier Killed in ISIL Attack near Syria’s Palmyra IBM Q's Radical 50-Qubit Quantum Computer to Push Computing to New Frontiers Water-Rich History on Mars: New Evidence New Materials Could Turn Water into Fuel of Future Compounds Could Be Basis for Devices That Turn Waste Heat into Electricity Syrian Army Raids Al-Nusra Positons in Dara'a Again Militants in More Regions End Battle against Syrian Army Syrian Army Wins back Nearly 20 towns, Heights, Farms from ISIL in Eastern Aleppo Syria in Last 24 Hours: Terrorists Sustain Heavy Losses in Army Offensive in Aleppo Province Syrian Army Expanding Control in Eastern Aleppo Syrian Army fully Secures Palmyra Airport after Intense Clashes with ISIL Iraqi Forces Retake Turkish Consulate Building in Mosul after Nearly 3 Years Under ISIL TEHRAN (FNA)- The Iraqi army recaptured the Turkish consulate general in Mosul about three years after it fell to ISIL as the group overran Iraq’s second largest city, Iraqi military sources said on Tuesday.

According to some Galaxy Note Edge owners, it also brings battery life problems along with it. With that in mind, we want to take an in-depth look at how to potentially fix bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life before and after Android 5.0 Lollipop. In September, Samsung took the curtain down from around its Galaxy Note Edge. As expected, the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge debuted with all sorts of bells and whistles including a new design, an improved display, a solid camera, and Android 4.4.4 KitKat. At the time, Android 4.4.4 KitKat was the most current version of Google’s mobile operating system. Given the Galaxy Note Edge’s status as a flagship, it was no surprise that it was among the first Samsung Galaxy smartphones to get Google’s new mobile OS, Android 5.0 Lollipop. The Galaxy Note Edge Lollipop update started rolling earlier this year and it delivers some big time features to Galaxy Note Edge users. Some have already gotten a taste of the changes, others are still waiting for the update to start rolling out. While the Galaxy Note Edge Lollipop update brings some huge changes to the device, it also brings Android 5.0 Lollipop problems including the usual array of battery life issues. Complaints about bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life have started to pick up as the software’s moved out to more variants and more regions around the world including the United States. Battery life issues always seem to plague Galaxy users after a new Android update though most of the time it’s not the actual update that’s causing the problems. Apps and other services are usually the culprit. For the moment, these Galaxy Note Edge battery life problems appear to be somewhat isolated though we do expect them to grow as more updates roll out. How to Fix Bad Galaxy Note Edge Battery Life With that in mind, we want to try and fix bad Samsung Galaxy Note Edge battery life for you. This guide delivers help to get better battery life on Samsung’s current flagship. These fixes should work if you’re on Android 4.4 KitKat or if you’re on Android 5.0 Lollipop. We’ve geared this towards Android 5.0 Lollipop users but we know that plenty of people remain on the older version of Google’s software. Find Apps Eating Up Your Battery The first recommendation we always make to people suffering from bad battery life is to check out third-party applications before doing anything else. Some people listen, some don’t. If you want to fix your bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life, you’re going to want to keep an eye on your applications for potential problems. Third-party apps have a tendency to put a huge dent into the battery life on smartphones regardless of the software that’s running on board. If you use an application a lot, it’s going to drain your battery but there are also times where bugs or issues might cause an app to go rogue and start abnormally draining the device’s charge. The first thing you’ll want to do is head into your settings and start taking a look at the effect that Galaxy Note Edge applications are having on the device’s battery life. If you notice anything out of the ordinary, it’s time to dig in. If you think an app is draining more battery life than it should be, try reinstalling it to see if that corrects the issue. If the problem persists, try uninstalling it to see if that has a positive effect. If you can’t figure out which app might be causing trouble, you’ll want to boot the Galaxy Note Edge into Safe Mode in an effort to single out potential troublemakers. Booting the device into Safe Mode disables third-party apps and allows you to isolate apps that could be causing the problems. Here’s how to boot the Galaxy Note Edge into Safe Mode: Power down the device. Then, press & hold the Power button and volume down key. Once it boots up, you can let go of the power button but keep the volume key held down. When you have successfully entered into Safe Mode, you will notice the text ‘Safe Mode’ at the bottom left corner of the screen. Restart the Galaxy Note Edge If you start noticing weird battery drain and or your Galaxy Note Edge starts heating up, you should try performing a simple restart to see if that returns things to normal. Most of you know how to restart the Galaxy Note Edge but we’ll remind you anyway. Hold down the power button, confirm that you want to turn it off, and then hold the power button down to turn it back on. We recommend doing this a few times a month to flush your device’s cache. Disable Unnecessary Services If your apps aren’t the problem and a simple restart doesn’t work, it’s time to start fiddling with some settings and working on some of your daily habits. In our experience, disabling features when they aren’t in use tends to have a positive impact on overall battery life. We recommend shutting off Wi-Fi connectivity when you don’t need it, Bluetooth connectivity when you don’t need it, NFC when you don’t need it, GPS when you don’t need it, and cellular data when you don’t need it. You can turn all of those off from inside the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge’s settings and you can easily monitor them with a quick swipe down from the top of the device’s screen. One thing that we’ve noticed is that poor cellular coverage is often to blame for bad Android battery life. When your Galaxy Note Edge needs to search hard for a signal, it runs the battery down faster, so keep that in mind when you’re in spotty areas. You may need to turn on Airplane Mode when there isn’t a strong 4G or LTE signal in the area. Try Using a Black Wallpaper Switching to a black wallpaper could help deliver better Galaxy Note Edge battery life thanks to the way Samsung’s Super AMOLED displays consume power. The device does not come with a default black wallpaper but you can search online for one. There are tons of them out there. After you’ve downloaded one, go to Settings, Wallpaper, Home and Lock Screens, More Images, and then set your black Galaxy Note Edge wallpaper. It’s a quick fix but there’s a chance that it will help. Start Using Its Built-in Software Features The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge comes equipped with two software features that you should know about if you’re experiencing bad battery life or if you’re concerned about the potential for bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life. If you head into the device’s Settings, you’ll notice two features. One is called Power Saving mode. The other is called Ultra Power Saving Mode. These features allow you to block background data and turn on grayscale mode which can help to limit the amount of juice being sucked up. You can also slow down the processor, reduce screen performance, turn off the lights on the buttons, and turn off GPS to save battery life. We also recommend getting familiar with the the Galaxy Note Edge’s brightness slider. The Galaxy Note Edge’s powerful display can suck up battery life so you’ll want to monitor the brightness of the screen if you’re starting to notice bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life. If auto-brightness isn’t working out, try doing it manually. Replace the Stock Launcher You also might want to consider replacing the stock TouchWiz launcher on the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge with something new. Samsung’s TouchWiz launcher has been known to hinder performance and it can be replaced. There are tons of different launches to choose from though the Nova Launcher is one of Android’s most popular choices. Give that a try if these other simple fixes don’t work out. Downgrade to Android 4.4 KitKat If you’ve already moved to Android 5.0 Lollipop, and some of you have, note that you can return to Android 4.4 KitKat in the event that Android 5.0 isn’t to your liking. We recently put together a guide on how to accomplish this so that’s going to be a great starting point for those of you that want to drop back down to Android 4.4. Factory Reset the Galaxy Note Edge If you don’t want to downgrade to Android 4.4 KitKat and you can’t find any fixes for your battery problems, you can factory reset your Galaxy Note Edge. This will wipe all of your files so you’ll need to make a backup before going this route. To factory reset the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge, go into Settings, User & Backup, and select Backup and Reset. From there, select Factory Data Reset. From there, select Reset Device and then Delete All. If nothing works, contact your carrier or Samsung. If you’re under warranty, you might be able to finagle your way into getting another device, or at the very least, a replacement battery. 8 Responses 05/20/2015 Jim Carter Reply The Lollipop update was certainly responsible for my battery/overheating issues as evidenced by flawless KitKat performance followed by immediate post update issues. There were no app additions, subtractions or updates. Upon seeing such stark evidence, I did a factory reset and all was well once again. Smartphones are no different than Windows PCs when it comes to OS updates. A clean install versus one OS on top of another is always the best choice. 05/26/2016 Carl Reply Soon tired of the remedies for fixing battery drain after an update.. If it wasn’t a problem before the update why should I have to go through all this crap of uninstalling all these apps BLACK WALLPAPER WTF? I didn’t buy this phone to make all kinds of changes these are not fixes but down grades on an expensive phone, this is useless info. 09/26/2016 Adam Reply I agree with Carl ^^^ 10/09/2016 Sergey Reply Usless article, misleading title. 10/29/2016 Deneiro Reply My phone is one year old, still making payments , went to Verizon , they told me to go buy a new battery, 30.00 dollars later I’m still pissed off 01/03/2017 Douglas Edwards Reply My Note Edge reboots when I still have 68% battery. A full charge with light to medium use last about 5 hours. I am considering tossing this and getting an IPhone. 02/10/2017 Bea Reply Yup, as well, Im still paying for my phone and it randomly shuts off and continuously reboots itself until I connect it to a charger. The jacked up part about it is I call T-Mobile and they suggested buying a new 30$ battery. WTF man! AND, I cant even talk on the damn thing in my house; shotty connectivity and doesnt matter if its wifi or data. Im just done with T-Mobile and Samsung…I will have to find another device that actually works as expected. Oh and my bill is over 200$ a month for two phones. 03/04/2017 Joe Reply Having the same problem with my Edge – starts resetting itself at around 37% – even with a brand new battery. Been doing a bit of research, and many are blaming the “fast charger” for the short battery cycle. For what it’s worth, I’m now draining and charging my batteries with a standard charger to see if it helps with the problem. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

The reports claimed the Chrome OS-running, Pixel-branded laptops have been discontinued by the Mountain View giant. Apparently, such reports are not at all true.  Osterloh has come out to correct the misinformation about Google’s budget-friendly laptop series. According to him, his statement at MWC 2017 may have been taken out of context, and this was what led many people to believe that Google does not intend to release more Chromebooks.  On Twitter, Osterloh clarified that Google is still building new Chromebooks, but the company does not have plans to release one as of this time. He wrote, “Hey all, Google’s own Chromebooks aren’t ‘dead‘ as has been reported. They will live on, we just have *no plans to share at this time* ;)”  According to TechnoBuffalo, it just makes sense for Google to continue with its Chromebooks business. After all, it is among the companies creating high-end Chromebooks that many people really appreciate and prefer over regular Windows-running laptops. The Google hardware is also seen by many as a good alternative to expensive Windows and Mac OS-powered portable computers.  Google introduced its first Chromebook Pixel device in 2013 and released a follow-up in 2015. Two years ago, Time reported that Chromebooks did well in the market with the education sector comprising 72 percent of the sales. In 2014, Chromebooks even beat out Apple’s iPad shipments to schools because they are cheaper and they appeal to users who simply want a practical device for school work. At present, there's already a large number of Chromebooks up for grabs in the market. Samsung, Asus, Dell, Acer and HP have since joined Google in providing consumers with more Chrome OS-running laptop options.  Google will continue the Chromebooks series despite reports saying the laptop line is dead.

Emerson (left) and Asher Labovich play with "Alexa," an Amazon Echo voice assistant, while their mom, Laura Labovich, looks on.  (Bill O'Leary / The Washington Post)   By Michael S. RosenwaldThe The Washington Post Sat., March 4, 2017 Kids adore their new robot siblings. As millions of American families buy robotic voice assistants to turn off lights, order pizzas and fetch movie times, children are eagerly co-opting the gadgets to settle dinner table disputes, answer homework questions and entertain friends at sleepover parties. Many parents have been startled and intrigued by the way these disembodied, know-it-all voices — Amazon’s Alexa, Google Home, Microsoft’s Cortana — are affecting their kids’ behaviour, making them more curious but also, at times, far less polite. In just two years, the promise of the technology has already exceeded the marketing come-ons. People with disabilities are using voice assistants to control their homes, order groceries and listen to books. Caregivers to the elderly say the devices help with dementia, reminding users what day it is or when to take medicine. For children, the potential for transformative interactions are just as dramatic — at home and in classrooms. But psychologists, technologists and linguists are only beginning to ponder the possible perils of surrounding kids with artificial intelligence, particularly as they traverse important stages of social and language development. Article Continued Below “How they react and treat this nonhuman entity is, to me, the biggest question,” said Sandra Calvert, a Georgetown University psychologist and director of the Children’s Digital Media Center. “And how does that subsequently affect family dynamics and social interactions with other people?” With an estimated 25 million voice assistants expected to sell this year at $40 to $180 (U.S.) — up from 1.7 million in 2015 — there are even ramifications for the diaper crowd. Toy giant Mattel recently announced the birth of Aristotle, a home baby monitor launching this summer that “comforts, teaches and entertains” using AI from Microsoft. As children get older, they can ask or answer questions. The company says, “Aristotle was specifically designed to grow up with a child.” Boosters of the technology say kids typically learn to acquire information using the prevailing technology of the moment — from the library card catalogue, to Google, to brief conversations with friendly, all-knowing voices. But what if these gadgets lead children, whose faces are already glued to screens, further away from situations where they learn important interpersonal skills? It’s unclear whether any of the companies involved are even paying attention to this issue. Amazon did not return a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Partnership for AI, a new organization that includes Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other companies working on voice assistants, said nobody was available to answer questions. “These devices don’t have emotional intelligence,” said Allison Druin, a University of Maryland professor who studies how children use technology. “They have factual intelligence.” Children certainly enjoy their company, referring to Alexa like just another family member. “We like to ask her a lot of really random things,” said Emerson Labovich, a Grade 5 pupil in Bethesda, Md., who pesters Alexa with her older brother, Asher. This winter, Emerson asked her almost every day for help counting down the days until a trip to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Florida. “She can also rap and rhyme,” Emerson said. Today’s children will be shaped by AI much like their grandparents were shaped by new devices called television. But you couldn’t talk with a TV. Ken Yarmosh, a 36-year-old northern Virginia app developer and founder of Savvy Apps, has multiple voice assistants in his family’s home, including those made by Google and Amazon. (The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos, whose middle name is Preston, according to Alexa.) Yarmosh’s 2-year-old son has been so enthralled by Alexa that he tries to speak with coasters and other cylindrical objects that look like Amazon’s device. Meanwhile, Yarmosh’s now 5-year-old son, in comparing his two assistants, came to believe Google knew him better. “Alexa isn’t smart enough for me,” he’d say, asking random questions that his parents couldn’t answer, like how many miles it is to China. (“China is 7,248 miles away,” Google Home says, “as the crow flies.”) In talking that way about a device plugged into a wall, Yarmosh’s son was anthropomorphizing it — which means to “ascribe human features to something,” Alexa happily explains. Humans do this a lot, Calvert said. We do it with dogs, dressing them in costumes on Halloween. We name boats. And when we encounter robots, we, especially children, treat them as near equals. In 2012, University of Washington researchers published results of a study involving 90 children interacting with a life-size robot named Robovie. Most kids thought Robovie had “mental states” and was a “social being.” When Robovie was shoved into a closet, more than half felt it wasn’t fair. A similar emotional connection is taking hold with Alexa and other assistants, even for parents. “It’s definitely become part of our lives,” said Emerson’s mother, Laura Labovich, who then quickly corrected herself: “She’s definitely part of our lives.” The problem, Druin said, is that this emotional connection sets up expectations for children that devices can’t or weren’t designed to meet, causing confusion, frustration and even changes in the way kids talk or interact with adults. Yarmosh’s son thought Alexa couldn’t understand him, but it was the algorithms that couldn’t grasp the pitch in his voice or the way children formulate questions. Educators introducing these devices into classrooms and school libraries have encountered the same issue. “If Alexa doesn’t understand the question, is it Alexa’s fault or might it be the question’s fault?” said Gwyneth Jones, a librarian who uses Amazon’s device at Murray Hill Middle School in Laurel, Md. “People are not always going to get what they are saying, so it’s important that they learn how to ask good questions.” Naomi Baron, an American University linguist who studies digital communication, is among those who wonder whether the devices, even as they get smarter, will push children to value simplistic language — and simplistic inquiries — over nuance and complex questions. Asking Alexa, “How do you ask a good question?” produces this answer: “I wasn’t able to understand the question I heard.” But she is able to answer a simple derivative: “What is a question?” “A linguistic expression used to make a request for information,” she says. And then there is the potential rewiring of adult-child communication. Although Mattel’s new assistant will have a setting forcing children to say “please” when asking for information, the assistants made by Google, Amazon and others are designed so users can quickly — and bluntly — ask questions. Parents are noticing some not-so-subtle changes in their children. In a blog post last year, a California venture capitalist wrote that his 4-year-old daughter thought Alexa was the best speller in the house. “But I fear it’s also turning our daughter into a raging a------,” Hunter Walk wrote. “Because Alexa tolerates poor manners.” To ask her a question, all you need to do is say her name, followed by the query. No “please.” And no “thank you” before asking a follow-up. “Cognitively I’m not sure a kid gets why you can boss Alexa around but not a person,” Walk wrote. “At the very least, it creates patterns and reinforcement that so long as your diction is good, you can get what you want without niceties.” Jones, the librarian, has witnessed the digital equivalent of everybody asking a question at the same time. “You all are being really pushy,” she’ll say, as Alexa declares over and over that she doesn’t understand. “You’re confusing her. One at a time, just like a person.” The personal yet transactional nature of the relationship is appealing to children and teenagers. Parents (including this reporter) have noticed that queries previously made to adults are shifting to assistants, particularly for homework: spelling words, simple math, historical facts. Or take the weather, particularly in winter. Instead of asking Mom or Dad the temperature that day, children just go to the device, treating the answer as gospel. Upside: No more fights over what the temperature will really be and what’s appropriate to wear. Downside: Kids will go to their parents less, with both sides losing out on timeworn interactions. “There can be a lot of unintended consequences to interactions with these devices that mimic conversation,” said Kate Darling, an MIT professor who studies how humans interact with robots. “We don’t know what all of them are yet.” But most researchers, educators and parents, even some kids, already agree that these devices need to be put in their place, just like a know-it-all sibling. Jones, the librarian, puts Alexa away for a couple of weeks at a time, so her students don’t rely on her too much. Yarmosh, who recently launched a project curating online videos for kids, is keeping the assistants out of his children’s rooms. Emerson and her brother take a school playground approach. “Alexa,” they’ll say, “you’re such a butt.” Read more about: Google, Microsoft, Amazon Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

In a 67-page document submitted to Mountain View City Council on 23 January 2017, the technology giant revealed extensive details of its plans for Google Charleston East, the company's first purpose-built office complex. Renderings show designs for a building with an elaborate tent-like structure, developed as a collaboration between architect Bjarke Ingels' Danish firm and designer Thomas Heatherwick's London studio. As revealed in earlier images, rooms will be divided up into rectilinear "pavilions", all sheltered beneath the roof canopy. The majority of the building's facilities – including laboratories, cafes, offices and events spaces – will be at ground level, while offices will be raised up on a mezzanine level above. The roof itself will be made up of curved metal squares in both pale and dark grey, including a finish that will deter birds from flying into it, according to the document. It will incorporate photovoltaic solar panels and "smile-shaped clerestories" to bring direct, indirect and diffused natural light down to the spaces below. The rest of the building will be constructed using a minimalist palette of materials that predominantly include metal and glass. The floor plan is deliberately designed to not line up with the roof above, to create "outdoor rooms" at corners. Some of the spaces designed for these corners include "sloped savannah", "hangout hill" and a sculpture garden. The designs still also include the "green loop" – a pedestrian pathway designed to snake through the building, creating a network of indoor/outdoor spaces lined with shops and cafes. "The design of Charleston East includes a large canopy that regulates indoor climate, air quality and sound, and encloses flexible components that can be rearranged as necessary," reads the document. "Our plans for the indoor and outdoor spaces include native habitats and vegetation designed to support local biodiversity and create educational opportunities for the community." BIG and Heatherwick Studio first unveiled their ambitious plans for a new Google campus in February 2015. Billed as a "vibrant new neighbourhood", it is set to be built by robots as a series of lightweight, mobile structures. In an exclusive interview with Dezeen, BIG founder Bjarke Ingels said the project would set a new industry standard for workplace design and help define "Google 2.0". Related story LinkedIn blocks BIG and Heatherwick's proposed Google HQ The project hit a major roadblock later that year, when city councillors gave social network LinkedIn the majority of the land Google were after. But the company then revealed that it had a backup option – it already had planning permission to build office and commercial space on the current site, which is located near Charleston Park. This site is significantly smaller, so the design team had to completely rework their design. The latest offering is much more compact than the original vision, and as yet there has been no mention of robot construction. BIG and Heatherwick Studio are also now working together on Google's London headquarters. Both offices also have many other big projects in the pipeline. BIG is also working on a combined power plant and ski slope for Copenhagen, the San Pellegrino HQ for Italy and the Hyperloop transportation system between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Heatherwick's current projects include the controversial Garden Bridge for London and a honeycomb-like structure for Hudson Yards in New York.

Amazon has WPP CEO Martin Sorrell  shook. Image: Getty Images/Slaven Vlasic By Patrick Kulp2017-03-05 02:20:20 UTC The mad men and women of the ad industry have plenty of reasons to toss and turn at night. Money is increasingly trickling from television commercials to digital media — a market that Facebook and Google currently have in a duopolistic chokehold. Inter-agency competition is at a fever pitch. Unconventional upstarts are eating their lunch. If Don Draper were around today, there's a good chance he'd work at Facebook. But it's not internet advertising giants that keep the industry's top chief up at night. Nor is it his three-month-old daughter. It's...Amazon? SEE ALSO: Amazon's fulfillment centers will soon run on solar energy "It's Amazon, which is a child still, but not three months," WPP CEO Martin Sorrell said of the source of his insomnia during an earnings call this week. "Amazon's penetration of most areas is frightening, if not terrifying to some." Yes, Sorrell, who heads the monster British parent company of Madison Avenue's biggest-name agencies, said he's most afraid of a shopping site with a relatively dinky advertising operation. And his concern is justified. Amazon has been quietly beefing up its ads business for months, according to various reports.  Assuming it continues to do so — and it's shown no indication that it won't — the potential shockwave should indeed scare industry incumbents.  While Amazon's ads currently comprise less than two percent of the digital market — Facebook and Google collectively control two-thirds — its most recent earnings release last month revealed that ad revenue grew the most of any part of the company for the quarter — a 60-percent jump from the same period in 2016. In fact, research firm Emarketer projects that Amazon will generate more than $1 billion in U.S. ad revenue this year — slightly more than its prediction for newly anointed Wall Street darling Snapchat, which is first and foremost an advertising-based business (despite its "camera company" spin). When an analyst asked in Amazon's earnings call about long-term advertising plans, Amazon's chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said only that it was "very early" and it seemed like a "good strategy," according to Business Insider. As Sorrell went on to say, Amazon's ambitions could have an enormous impact on the current industry order. Advertising online is a numbers game — both in terms of people reached and knowledge of who those people are. Facebook and Google are successful at it because they've been able to log information on your online habits for years and steer their ads accordingly. Amazon has its own war chest of data culled from millions of customer searches, purchases and even music and video streams. Shoppers might browse for products on Google, Sorrell said, but Amazon's dominance of the e-commerce market means it knows more about people's consumption choices than anyone in the world. That's of course particularly valuable information to advertisers looking to lock down online sales. It's the kind of awareness Facebook, Google and other digitals platforms have been trying to master for years with features like buy buttons, real-world store receipt-matching and shoppable ads.  Yet their crutch — Google's in particular — has always been that people still tend to leave the platform when they actually want to buy things. Amazon doesn't have that problem. Sorrell is of course also wary of Facebook and Google's intimidating power. But he said the company's business relationship with each made them more "frenemies" than antagonists. Agencies work with the two companies to place ads for clients, but they also compete with the tech giants' in-house creative shops and other means of undercutting the middleman. Sorrell ranked Amazon as the least friendly of the three but qualified that it's still early days. The company also recently set up a Seattle agency specifically to deal with Amazon, he said.  Because, as they say, keep your friends close, and your frenemies closer.

The iPhone 7 was not so much of an upgrade compared to its predecessor, so Apple is poised to change that with the next iPhone. On the other hand, Google’s Pixel 2 could raise the bar for Android smartphones coming out this 2017. Given that both handsets are likely to emerge successful upon their respective launch, it’s just fitting for us to look into them and see if one can one-up the other based on their rumored specs and features. Performance Apple’s iPhone 7 impressed a lot of people when it launched with the Apple A10 Fusion chip, which is basically a quad-core ARM processor composed of two high-performance Hurricane cores and two high-efficiency Zephyr cores. The six-core PowerVR Series7XT Plus GPU was also no joke for it enabled the device to do “console-level” performance when running mobile games. This year, the Cupertino giant is rumored to bring its A11 processor to the next-generation iPhone. Back in December, The Motley Fool reported that Apple’s supplier, TSMC, is going to manufacture the smartphone CPU using 10-nanometer technology. It is then expected to be more powerful and faster than the A10 Fusion. As for its GPU, analysts have said that the next-generation iPhone could come equipped with Imagination Technologies’ Series8XT, which is reportedly more power-efficient than the one on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Geekbench scores for the current iPhones are really impressive, so we’re hoping to see higher ratings for the iPhone 8’s performance.  Google also ensured that its flagship smartphone, the Pixel, would be a powerhouse. The Android 7.1 Nougat-running handset debuted with the Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, which is made up of two 2.15 GHz Kryo cores and two 1.6 GHz Kryo cores. The device also came wth the Adreno 530 GPU. The CPU and GPU combo in the Pixel was regarded as pretty stellar by the tech industry at the time. Looking at it now, however, the combination wouldn’t really be as impressive as before. Despite receiving great scores from Geekbench, it’s clear that the Pixel was nowhere near the iPhone 7 in terms of performance. BGR’s comparison of the handsets’ Geekbench scores showed that the Apple device crushed the Google phone in both the single-core (3488 vs. 1565) and multi-core (5590 x 4103) tests. The Pixel 2 is rumored to run on Snapdragon 835 CPU — the same chipset that will be powering Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. If this were the case, then it’s certain that the iPhone 8 will trump the Pixel 2 in terms of performance. The Geekbench results for the Galaxy S8+ have already been leaked, and the Snapdragon 835 chipset received a lower score than the iPhone 7 Plus in the single-core test (1929 vs. 3473). In the multi-core test, the processor did better than the A10 Fusion, but the difference isn’t as significantly large as in the single-core test (6084 vs. 5664).  Display For the most part, the iPhone 8 is claimed to launch with a 5.8-inch display. What would make this screen special is the company’s rumored venture into edge-to-edge display that would see the death of the physical home button. This will not come as a surprise if true because the big players in the smartphone industry are migrating to this type of display for their flagship devices. LG already showed off its edge-to-edge design on the G6 at the recently concluded MWC 2017. Samsung is also said to have embraced this type of display design for its Galaxy S8. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said back in February (via MacRumors) that the iPhone 8's display is an OLED panel. In spite of the larger screen estate, fans can expect the handset itself to retain the size of the current iPhone. Kuo said the measurements of the phone’s form factor would be the same as those of the iPhone 7, but the rather large screen will eat up the entire front panel of the iPhone 8. This would be possible thanks to the advanced technology that would allow Apple to embed its Touch ID fingerprint scanner onto the display itself. There were rumors of Apple killing off Touch ID for a more advanced 3D scanner with facial recognition technology, but come to think of it, it’s unlikely for the Cupertino giant to just get rid of Touch ID after all of the hard work it has put into making it the first line of defense of iPhone users from hackers as well as the verification tool to authorize users’ purchases and other mobile monetary transactions. Nothing about the screen resolution has been mentioned so far, but we’re hoping Apple is considering bumping up the 750 x 1334 resolution and 331 ppi pixel density on the iPhone 7 for this year’s iPhone.  The original Google Pixel launched with a 5-inch AMOLED capacitive screen with 1080 x 1920 screen resolution and 441 ppi pixel density. Based on speculations from tech insiders, Google is sticking with the 5-inch screen size for the Pixel 2. It is also expected to have a 2560 x 1440 screen resolution. This improved screen resolution will make the handset the perfect partner of Google’s VR headset Daydream. While many believe that Google could be bringing the design of the first-generation Pixel to the upcoming version, there are also others who are hoping for the company to follow the new trend of edge-to-edge displays. If done well, this could help increase the reception of consumers since not everyone was a fan of the rather large top and bottom bezels of the original Pixel smartphone. Pocket-lint says shrinking the bezels is one way for Google to stay competitive now that most of the big players in the phone-making scene are starting to embrace the almost bezel-less design for their devices. There also wouldn’t be a problem if the Mountain View giant shifts to edge-to-edge display since the fingerprint scanner on the original Pixel is rear-mounted. By keeping the sensor at the back, Google will have less challenges to take on in making the almost all-screen front possible.  Camera Technology At launch, the biggest selling point of the iPhone 7 was its advanced camera technology. Its bigger brother stole the show for the most part with its dual-lens camera module that was marketed as a technology that captures DLSR-quality photos. The iPhone 7 also has a similar kind of camera; the only difference is it has a single lens instead of two. It has the same 12-megapixel sensor, phase detection autofocus, optical image stabilization and the quad-LED (dual tone) flash. For its front camera, the iPhone 7 sports a 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera that’s capable of taking 1080p@30fps videos. It also has face detection, HDR and panoramic features. There’s no word yet on how Apple intends to top the rear camera of the iPhone 7, but there’s now word on a powerful front-facing selfie camera with 3D-sensing capabilities. This actually fueled speculations that Apple is getting rid of Touch ID because the front snapper is said to function as a 3D facial scanner as well as an iris scanner. JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall was even quoted by MacRumors in a separate report that facial recognition is a more secure alternative for Apple Pay.  On the contrary, Google set the bar high for Android-powered phones in terms of camera technology when it introduced its Google Pixel late last year. It even got a recognition from DxO Mark as the best smartphone camera yet. The back camera on the Pixel has a 12.3-megapixel sensor, an f/2.0 aperture, electronic image stabilization and laser autofocus as well as dual-LED (dual tone) flash. Despite not really having specifications that would make it stand out by leaps, Wired explains that the camera just impresses and blows everyone away because its HDR+ marquee mode takes images in rapid succession, analyzes them and creates some tone-mapping magic to create stunning photographs. The 8-megapixel front snapper is also commendable. This 2017, Google is likely to put a major emphasis on the camera of the Pixel 2. 9to5Google learned through sources that the company is developing a camera lens that will perform impressively even in low light conditions. The megapixels will not see a significant increase, but Google is going to compensate for this with extra camera features. Miscellaneous The iPhone 8 is going to have a water-resistant body. Compared to its predecessor, The Korea Herald reports the next-generation iPhone will have a higher water resistance rating. The iPhone 7 has IP67 rating by the way. With the 10th anniversary iPhone, Apple is aiming for an IP68 rating that would enable users to submerge their handsets underwater for 30 minutes without negative repercussions. There are also rumors Apple is re-adopting the glass body it used on the iPhone 4 instead of keeping its streak of using the aluminum body found on the recent iPhones. Apple supplier Catcher Technology says (via Nikkei) the glass body is returning this year. If true, Apple could make use of stainless steel frames to hold together the front and back glass panels of the device. For users who are very particular with the internal memory of their daily driver, the next iPhone could be the best iPhone for you yet. CNET reported late last month that Samsung’s biggest rival is ditching the 32GB base model for a generous 64GB starting memory variant. Previously, Apple got rid of the 16GB entry-level model when it launched the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Other expected specs and features for the iPhone 8 include wireless charging, support for Apple Pencil, 3GB of RAM and a new color variant (Red). Given the premium hardware of the next-generation iPhone, it is said to come with a hefty price tag that could exceed $1,000.  Water resistance has become a must-have feature of flagship phones, so the Pixel 2 is also rumored to sport a water-resistant body. Trusted Reviews claims Google could be looking to build a handset with either an IP67 or IP68 rating just to compete with the iPhone 8 and the Galaxy S8. The Pixel 2 is also expected to come with a tougher build because the original Pixel’s metal body is prone to scratches and dents. Some are hoping for Google to improve the audio experience in the next-generation Pixel since the first-generation device have tiny and downward facing speakers. Perhaps Google could equip the handset with more powerful speakers to make it a notable media-centric device. Rumor also has it that the Mountain View-headquartered company is going to increase the base model’s internal memory. The first Pixel debuted with 32GB and 128GB storage variants. Since video files and mobile games are becoming more ambitious, a larger internal memory would come in handy. Thus, sources are saying Google could be boosting the base model’s storage to 64GB. Other standout features that are expected for the Pixel 2 include Quick Charge 4.0 and Android 8 or another modified Android software like the Android 7.1 Nougat of the first Pixel. Meanwhile, it’s very likely for Google to keep the same price points of the predecessors for the new models.  Apple is likely to launch the iPhone 8 in September, while Google could hold an October/November launch event for the Pixel 2. Which do you think between the two smartphones is going to impress more consumers at launch? Sound off in the comments below.  Which is the better handset between Apple's iPhone 8 and Google's Pixel 2?

If you don’t it is because you don’t remember them. A dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. The various uses to which many people have put their dreams are generating more interest in the subject. A good example is the popular Google search engine, which was ‘download’ to the inventor, a 23-year-old student Larry Page, in a dream. Today, Google is not just an Internet search engine, but is really one of the world’s leading companies. Page had a net worth of $40.7 billion in November 2016 according to Bloomberg. As a student, Larry Page had an irrational fear that he’d been accepted into Stamford University by mistake – which trigged an anxiety dream. He imagined that he could download the entire web onto some old computers lying around, so he got up in the middle of the night to do some mathematics of it and found that the dream was possible. The holy books have many more examples of how God sometimes communicates with people through dreams. And there are some clergymen who use dreams to treat spiritual cases. They pray for people and urge them to take note of their dreams through which the causes of their problems are sometimes revealed. Hidden truths In a study of dreams it was found that most people believe that “their dreams reveal meaningful hidden truths”. In one study conducted in the United States, South Korea and India, they found that 74 per cent of Indians, 65 per cent of South Koreans and 56 per cent of Americans believed their dream content provided them with meaningful insight into their unconscious beliefs and desires. This view of dreaming is said to have been endorsed significantly more than theories of dreaming than attribute dream content to memory consolidation, problem-solving, or random brain activity. Researchers Morewedge and Norton also found that people attribute more importance to dream content than to similar thought content that occurs while they are awake. In one study, Americans were more likely to report that they would miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing than if they thought of their plane crashed the night before flying (while awake), and that they would be as likely to miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before their flight as if there was an actual plane crash on the route they intended to take. Not all dream content was considered equally important. Participants in their studies were more likely to perceive dreams to be meaningful when the content of dreams was in accordance with their beliefs and desires while awake. People were more likely to view a positive dream about a friend to be meaningful than a positive dream about someone they disliked, for example, and were more likely to view a negative dream about a person they disliked as meaningful than a negative dream about a person they liked. Some more fascinating things about dreams are being observed as shown in a compilation by PsyBlog Why the brain remembers dreams Some people recall all kinds of dreams, others hardly anything. Why the big difference? Part of the reason that some people recall more of their dreams is that they wake up more in the night, even if only for short periods. We need to be awake to encode dreams into long-term memory; otherwise they are generally lost to the night. The dream control centre Whether you remember dreams, then, depends on whether you are a light or heavy sleeper. High dream recallers are more reactive to environmental stimuli, awaken more during sleep, and thus better encode dreams in memory than low dream recallers. Indeed the sleeping brain is not capable of memorizing new information; it needs to awaken to be able to do that. Daydreamers are also night-dreamers The overlap between waking and dreaming states was at the heart of the Matrix films. Sci-fi aside, though, the film asked: when we’re awake, are we really awake or is this just another dream? Neuroscientists have found that the parts of the brain responsible for daydreaming while we’re awake are also responsible for our dreaming while we sleep. Effectively, the neural substrate responsible for dreaming may be a sub-system of that responsible for our waking lives. “…Dreaming may be the quintessential cognitive simulation because it is often highly complex, often includes a vivid sensory environment, unfolds over a duration of a few minutes to a half hour, and is usually experienced as real while it is happening.” Some people cannot dream Some say that they don’t have dreams, but in all likelihood they do, it’s just that they don’t remember their dreams because they are heavy sleepers. There are some people, though, who genuinely cannot dream. Often as a result of brain damage from strokes, these patients can be awoken repeatedly during the night and asked about their dreams: they claim never to be dreaming People everywhere dream about the same stuff: A study of 50,000 dream reports by US psychologist Calvin S. Hall and colleagues found that there are remarkable similarities in the way people dream all around the world: Dreams are usually phantasmagoric: people, places, events and objects tend to merge into one another. The most common emotion experienced in dreams is that anxiety and negative emotions are much more prevalent than positive. The vast majority of people dream in colour–if you watched monochrome TV growing up, though, you’re more likely to dream in black-and-white. Only around 10 per cent of dreams are sexual in nature, although the percentage is higher amongst adolescents. Recording a lucid dream: Recording what happens in the brain during a particular dream is hard. You can put people inside brain scanners while they’re asleep and then ask them afterwards what they dreamed about, but the problem is they don’t know when they dreamed it. So, it ends up being tricky matching up the brain imaging results with a particular dream. One solution is to use lucid dreamers. These are people who have trained themselves to be aware of when they are dreaming and who can also take control of their dreams. A recent study which used lucid dreamers this way found significant overlaps between the activity in the brain during wakefulness and during sleep one of the authors, Michael Czisch, explained: “Our dreams are therefore not a ‘sleep cinema’ in which we merely observe an event passively, but involve activity in the regions of the brain that are relevant to the dream content.” Share How I cure baldness using these natural techniques.

The company launched the first beta of Android Studio 2.3 back in December, shortly after the massive release of Android Studio 2.2. Developers have been testing the beta over the past couple of months, so it may not come as a surprise that Google has decided the software is stable enough to be released publicly. The new update builds upon the features many have already been testing in the beta. Android Studio 2.3 is not the crème de la crème filled with a trove of juicy new features as Android Studio 2.2 was. The focus of 2.3 is on the quality of features that were previously introduced. For example, Google has significantly tweaked the Instant Run feature to make it much more reliable. Pressing the Run button will now force an application restart so that the changes in your code are reflected in the application preview window. Here is a rundown of improvements and features Android Studio 2.3 brings to the table: Build Instant Run Improvements and UI Changes: The Run action will now always cause an application restart to reflect changes in your code that may require a restart. The new Apply Changes action will attempt to swap the code while your apps keep running. The underlying implementation has changed significantly to improve reliability. Build Cache: Introduced but disabled by default in Android Studio 2.2, Build Cache is an underlying build optimization for faster builds in Android Studio. By caching exploded AARs and pre-dexed external libraries, the new build cached leads to faster clean builds. Design Chains and Ratios support in ConstraintLayout: Android Studio 2.3 included the stable release of ConstraintLayout. With this release ConstraintLayout, you can now chain two or more Android views bi-directionally together to form a group on one dimension. ConstraintLayout also supports ratios, which is helpful when you want to maintain the aspect ratio of widgets. Layout Editor Palette: The updated widget palette in the Layout Editor allows you to search, sort and filter to find widgets for your layouts. Layout Favorites: You can now save your favorite attributes per widget in the updates Layout Editor properties panel. WebP Support: WebP images can now be generated from PNG assets in your project, saving space (up to 25 percent) in your APK. There is also a new wizard that converts PNG to lossless WebP, allowing you to inspect loosy WebP encoding. Material Icon Wizard Update: The updated vector asset wizard supports search and filtering, plus it includes labels for each icon asset. Develop Lint Baseline: With Android Studio 2.3, you can set unresolved lint warnings as a baseline in your project. From that point forward, Lint will report only new issues. This is helpful if you have many legacy lint issues in your app, but just want to focus on fixing new issues. App Links Assistant: Supporting Android App Links in your app is now easier with Android Studio. The new App Links Assistant allows you to easily create new intent filters for your URLs, declare your app's website association through a Digital Asset Links file, and test your Android App Links support. Template Updates: By default, all templates in Android Studio 2.3 which use to contain RelativeLayout, now use ConstraintLayout. There is also a new Bottom Navigation Activity template, which implements the Bottom Navigation Material Design guideline. IntelliJ Platform Update: Android Studio 2.3 includes the IntelliJ 2016.2 release, which has enhancements such as an updated inspection window and a notifications system. Test Android Emulator Copy & Paste: Back by popular demand, Google has added the Copy & Paste feature to the latest Emulator (v25.3.1). Android Emulator Command Line Tools: The emulator has been moved from the SDK Tools folder into a separate emulator directory. The “android avd” command has been deprecated and replaced with a standalone avdmanager command. If you create Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) directly through the command line you should update any corresponding scripts. You can download Android Studio 2.3 for Windows, Mac, and Linux directly from Google's Android Studio.

Google started the trend with its unveil of the Assistant in October 2016, but Amazon caught up soon with its Alexa voice assistant.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest No, Amazon Echo’s ‘Skills’ aren’t the new branded apps Jeff Ragovin, Social Native March 4, 2017 2:33 PM Tags: Amazon Echo, Jeff Ragovin Above: Amazon Echo Image Credit: Amazon Back in early 2009, many brands realized for the first time that iPhone apps could be a branding vehicle. Suddenly, there was a frenzy of activity as marketers rushed branded apps to the marketplace. In 2017, history seems to be repeating itself. In this case, many marketers are quickly building “Skills” on Amazon Echo. Such Skills include ordering a pizza on Domino’s, fetching an Uber, and connecting to your FitBit. In early January, Amazon announced it had 7,000 Skills in its Alexa Skills Marketplace, a 7X increase in seven months. Many of those are branded Skills. For instance, GE is using Alexa as a means to provide voice control for its appliances, and BMW and Hyundai feature Alexa in their vehicles, while LG even lets people control their fridge. Despite the presence of such major brands, though, this isn’t the second coming of the App Store. Voice-control isn’t actually new, for one thing, and its use cases are much more limited than those of standard apps. Skills are less a brand-building exercise than an Echo-building exercise. The zero UI era Alexa is the most conspicuous element of home automation, but the market is growing quickly and will soon include other big players. Google introduced Google Home in November 2016. Apple’s HomeKit lets consumers turn on their lights and adjust their thermostats via Siri. Microsoft is also bringing its Cortana voice-controlled interface into this environment. Juniper Research estimates that the number of connected appliances in smart homes will rise to 20 million by 2020. In this so-called “zero-UI” environment, consumers will interact with brands via their voices, gestures, and facial recognition, among other AI-based technologies. So far, that communication is mostly happening via voice. In this context though, Amazon’s Echo isn’t really anything new. Consumers can get the same functionality from an iPhone with Siri, an Android phone with Google’s voice recognition, and Microsoft’s Cortana. In fact, you can place any recent-vintage Windows laptop on your kitchen counter and do everything you can do with Echo, including order a Domino’s pizza. Chances are you won’t, though, because you’d probably rather see what you’re ordering. That’s one major problem with voice-only interfaces: They are lousy for shopping. Imaging trying to find a new pair of shoes, for instance, by listening to Alexa read back descriptions. Voice control is also awkward to use in public and is still glitchy enough to get things wrong. Last year, J.D. Power said voice-control dashboard interfaces were the No. 1 problem for motorists. The future for voice control While voice control will invariably improve, it’s unlikely that consumers of the near future will use Alexa to call on their favorite Skills. As with smartphones, they are likely to either use generic commands like “order me a pizza” or “check my bank balance” and have Alexa fill in the relevant brands. That’s a huge opportunity for Amazon, but the company will be vying with Google, Apple, and Microsoft, among others, all of whom are working to build out voice-based search. None of those companies have yet offered a competitor to Amazon’s Skills, perhaps for good reason. Unlike Amazon, those companies don’t have to support a cute device that so far is a novelty rather than a necessity. At this point, Skills are more a value-add for Echo than a full-blown ecosystem like the App Store. That could change, but even in the App Store, most branded apps don’t get a lot of traction. In the future, when consumers talk to brands, they’ll be calling on Alexa, Google, Siri, and Cortana. The rest will be on their own.

Live Watch Internet Trolls, Beware! 'Bounty Hunter' Can Expose You By KI MAE HEUSSNER Nov. 1, 2010 0 Shares Email Star PlayABCNEWS.com WATCH Conversation: Cyberbullies and Trolls 0 Shares Email He has been called a bounty hunter for the digital era, and for good reason. After Michael Roberts' own name was smeared across the Internet by an online antagonist, crushing his successful business and threatening personal relationships, Roberts made it his mission to help other victims of online defamation rout out the anonymous Internet trolls trying to upend their lives. The Australian native launched a Las Vegas-based company called Rexxfield, dedicated to digital forensic analysis and online reputation defense. (Nevada was chosen as the home base because its state laws are more favorable for those suing for libel damages.) Play null Since starting the firm in 2008, Roberts said he has helped more than 150 people unmask their online attackers. His firm boasts an 80 to 90 percent success rate for positively identifying anonymous Internet posters. He recently launched the non-profit FreespeechV3.org, a pro bono arm of his company, to give victims of online defamation even more support. By the time people contact him, they've been branded whores, child abusers, liars and other vicious epithets on the Internet. They're spirits are so deflated, some consider ending their lives, he said. nullPlay null "You can hear it in the voice of the people when they first contact you," he said. "And once the problem is solved they're like a different person." Billionaires, Royalty Among Those Looking to Expose Anonymous Online Harassers Roberts counts billionaires and royalty among his clientele and two of the most recent high-profile cases involving unmasking anonymous posters were ones in which he was involved. A couple of weeks ago, one of his pro bono clients, Carla Franklin, succeeded in obtaining a court order from a New York judge instructing Google to identify people who posted defamatory content about her on YouTube. nullPlay null Another pro bono client, Vogue cover model Liskula Cohen, made headlines last summer when she successfully sued Google to uncover the name of an anonymous blogger who slandered her online. But how does this modern-day bounty hunter track down his prey? Roberts said it often starts with the Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is the unique number assigned to any device connected to the Internet. IP Address Is 'Smoking Gun,' Online Investigator Says "That's the smoking gun that inexorably links the offensive posting to the address – not the person, of course, but the address," he said. Play Rutgers Students Remember Tyler Clementi With Weekend Vigil When someone goes online and posts a comment on a website or writes a blog post, an IP address connects the computer he or she is using to a physical address. That IP address is logged both by the Internet Service Provider and by the website hosting the content. It's the key piece of information that can pierce the so-called veil of anonymity online, but Roberts said that there's one problem: It's perishable information. "The moment somebody posts their smear or their diatribe, the clock starts ticking," he said. In most states, the statute of limitations for Internet libel for civil relief is one year, he said, although a few states extend the limit to two or three years. And, he added, ISPs, search engines and other websites regularly purge their systems of IP address logs. nullPlay null But IP Address Is Often Not Enough They aren't required by law to store the information for any specific amount of time, so they set their own policies governing the deletion of files. Roberts said that from his experience, ISPs tend to delete IP information after about six months; Web companies, such as Google, tend to hold on to information for longer. The information held by the ISP, however, is actually more critical, he said. While an IP address stored by a website might be able to lead a forensic expert to the ISP that enabled the Internet connection, the IP address held by an ISP can actually lead the expert to an Internet troll's front door. But Internet companies don't just hand over these keys. A subpoena and, in some cases, a court order, are necessary to force the companies to release the IP addresses. Even after Roberts obtains the requested IP addresses, his job is not always finished. "So many cases fail, whether it be harassment, wire fraud, whatever it might be, because it's like a doorway we know the person walked through, but so did 100 other people," he said. An IP address can tell him where the poster's computer may be located, but it doesn't absolutely link a specific person to that computer. To identify the individuals behind online attacks, Roberts said he uses a combination of high-tech expertise and old-fashioned instinct. Digital Forensics, Linguistics Help Identify Online Attackers "We have to triangulate the individual with digital evidence that can't be obtained electronically," he said. Assuming a victim has a sense of who might be behind the attacks (which they often do, he said), he and his specialized team reach into their black box of tricks to map out the individual's social network. Using what he called "social forensics," they figure out the person's friends, most frequented sites and habits online. "They leave lots of electronic footprints," he said. In 75 to 85 percent of the cases, those tactics are enough to positively identify the perpetrators of online attacks, Roberts said. But in some cases, he goes a step further, enlisting a Ph.D.-trained forensic linguist. "[She] can examine known samples of writing with the anonymous writings and link them together with the little idiosyncrasies in the person's prose," he said. While Roberts does take on several cases on a pro bono basis, he said, most cases cost about $5,000 to $10,000 (not including legal fees which, depending on the circumstances, can significantly inflate the price). But his clients say that the expense is worth it. Patty McPeak, founder of natural products company Nanacea, said that after she left her previous company, where she had been CEO, online commenters wrote vicious posts about her and her family. The ordeal continued for about two years, but Roberts' company helped expose the commenters. And when McPeak let them know that she had learned their identities, the online onslaught stopped. At 69-years-old, she said, she had no desire to spend her golden years suing them, but just knowing who was behind the attacks was enough. "I would have gone to my grave wondering who would have said such awful things about me," said McPeak, who lives in El Dorado Hills, Calif. "I have such peace of mind knowing who these people are. It would never have been possible without this." 0 Shares Email Star Comments Internet 'Bounty Hunter' Goes After Digital Trolls +Great Pumpkin: Secret to Growing Giant Gourds +Why Do We Like to Scare Ourselves?

Mediawatch talks to a Canadian expert who is not sure the plans will work. ​ Listen duration 19′ :09″ Add to playlistPlaylist Download Download as Ogg Download as MP3 Play Ogg in browser Play MP3 in browser Listen The Canadian report which proposed bold law changes to help the news media in Canada push back against the dominance of Facebook and Google. Photo: screenshot News media companies in developed countries all over the world are struggling with the consequences of digital disruption: declining profits, too much news available for free online and global giants like Facebook and Google gobbling up much of the advertising revenue.    In the New Zealand Herald last weekend, Fran O’Sullivan - the head of business for NZME (the Herald’s publisher) said it was time for a Kiwi solution to the problems here.  Our government had shied away from taking action on offshore online titans Facebook and Google siphoning off the advertising revenues, she said, while South Australian senator Nick Xenophon has been pushing for rules to make them pay local media producers.  “In the same way that Facebook and Google have made billions out of being innovative businesses, we need to find innovative ways to make them pay back a fair share of their profits to the companies they are taking content from,” Senator Xenophon recently told The Australian newspaper. Protecting traditional media companies is crucial democracy and open debate, he said. Last year the Canadian government commissioned independent think-tank The Public Policy Forum to ask experts and the public what should be done. It raised the issue like this in an online video, with a strangely jaunty soundtrack. Last month the Public Policy Forum put forward its conclusions in a report called The Shattered Mirror: News, Democracy and Trust in the Digital Age. The Canadian government expected to respond to these proposals by middle of the year. Among its recommendations is a 10 per cent withholding tax on advertising carried by foreign digital media. This, the PPF said, could bring in more than NZ$400 million a year to add to a similar fund for Canada’s media which already harvests a five-percent levy on cable, satellite and online video-on-demand services. In Canada, Facebook and Google have - predictably - hit back at the idea.   Professor Michael Geist is world authority on technology law from Canada’s University of Ottawa.  "Making the advertising on popular digital services more expensive penalises the companies looking to advertise," Professor Geist  - who also writes for the Toronto Star newspaper. "Media companies in digital transition have come to depend upon these ad networks," he said.  The PPF also urged the Canadian government to place its advertising with only Canada-based companies. "If you want government advertising and public service messages to be effective, it would be crazy to advertise only in certain media knowing you were going to exclude a certain segment of the population. People 18-25 are not watching the 6 or 10 o'clock news." he says. The Shattered Mirror report also suggested tightening up copyright law to prevent news created at great expense by one news outlet being lifted or copied by others online  - as happens all too often these days. Michael Geist. Photo: RNZ / Chris Reid "We all have sympathy for the entity that created a story in the first place, but  copyright  doesn't protect the ideas," said Professor Geist. "We depend upon multiple organisations to get parts of a story. We don't want to silo our news world," he said. Some countries have pursued so-called "link taxes", imposing a cost on online republication. "You end up with media organisation suddenly finding readership declining significantly because they are pretty dependent on search and social media services to drive traffic," he said.  "If we view (the media) as a significant priority, it is reasonable to use tax dollars. Even if some people object, it is cleaner than taxes, levies or tinkering with the costs of other essential services," said Prof Geist.   These issues are also being addressed here in New Zealand by the Peoples' Commission on Broadcasting and Media. This new group is holding meetings around the country and plans to present a report and recommendations for reform to the government in May. It is also seeking submission from the public. Full details can be found here: www.makeourmediabetter.org.nz/   Tags: internet media technology Canada Facebook Google Public Policy Forum Shatterd Mirror media policy Embed Share this Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share via email Share on Google Plus Share on Reddit Share on Linked In To embed this content on your own webpage, cut and paste the following:

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Caught in another Controversial Story about Supporting Slave and Child Labor in Congo | Main | Apple Still in the Hunt for a Transformative Acquisition to set Apple TV on Fire Prior to the Arrival of the Mobile TV Revolution » March 04, 2017 Apple Struggled in the Education Market in 2016 as Schools on Tight Budgets Chose Chromebooks   Back in 2014 AppleInsider's editorial writer and digital assassin Daniel Dilger took the Financial Times to task on the subject of Google Chromebooks overtaking Apple in Education. Since that time stories have kept piling in with the same conclusion that Google's Chromebook was the top computer used in the classroom. USA Today, 9to5Mac, CNBC, Fast Company and others kept that story front and center over the years along with the statistics to backup those claims. This week the New York Times weighed in with a report titled "Apple's Devices Lose Luster in American Classrooms," based on new education market statistics from Futuresource.   The NY Times report starts off dramatically by stating that "Apple is losing its grip on American classrooms, which technology companies have long used to hook students on their brands for life.   Over the last three years, Apple's iPads and Mac notebooks — which accounted for about half of the mobile devices shipped to schools in the United States in 2013 — have steadily lost ground to Chromebooks, inexpensive laptops that run on Google's Chrome operating system and are produced by Samsung, Acer and other computer makers.   Mobile devices that run on Apple's iOS and macOS operating systems have now reached a new low, falling to third place behind both Google-powered laptops and Microsoft Windows devices, according to a report released on Thursday by Futuresource Consulting, a research company.   Futuresource noted in their report that of the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States in 2016, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, up from 50 percent in 2015.   School shipments of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 19 percent, from about 25 percent, over the same period. Microsoft Windows laptops and tablets remained relatively stable at about 22 percent, Futuresource said. Mike Fisher, an education technology analyst at Futuresource told the Times that "Apple is struggling." For more on the NY Times report, click here.   Google's Chromebook Continues to Win   Futuresource's report that was published on Thursday noted that "Sales of Mobile PCs into the US K-12 sector continued to develop in 2016, with annual shipments growing 18% year-on-year in 2016, reaching 12.6 million units, up from 10.7 million in 2015. The outlook for 2017 is also positive with market shipment growth forecast to remain in double figures."   The number one platform in education was from Google. Their strengths were a "strong combination of affordable devices, productivity tools via G-Suite, easy integration with third party platforms/tools, task management/distribution via Google Classroom and easy device management remains extremely popular with US teachers and IT buyers alike. The rise of Chromebooks has also set new industry benchmarks with regards to average device pricing, with prices reaching as low as $120 on certain projects."   The Rise of Hybrid Tablet-Notebooks   The last point of interest is the report's position on hybrid devices for this year. "It is the area of '2-in-1' devices (devices that can be utilised both as tablets and with an integrated keyboard for productivity applications) that are expected to be the major competitive area in 2017.   Both Microsoft and Google (and their respective partners) have announced a wide range of 2-in-1 products designed specifically for education and are expected to sell for under $300.   The 2-in-1 form factor is ideal for education, providing schools with flexibility in usage. In addition, the technology behind stylus/pen usage has developed rapidly and 'inking' is expected to become widespread and add value to device usage.   Mike Fisher, Associate Director of Education at Futuresource Consulting, added that "PC provider's laser focus on the education sector is good news for schools and students. 2017 will see wide ranges of computing devices, designed specifically for education and at competitive price points, entering the market and vying to be the device of choice for learning."   Though for most school districts it's about tight budgets and this is where the Chromebook usually gets the nod.   Last year Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple and IBM have launched their First MobileFirst App for Education Called 'Watson Element'," showing that many schools are looking for deeper educational tools and more advanced devices like the iPad.   Considering that the top Fortune 500 companies and now leading medical facilities around the U.S. like Stanford Medicine are using the iPad, many schools will want to ensure that their students are familiar with tools that industry leaders prefer.   Not every school wants to work with bottom of the line tools and so Apple will continue to introduce new iPad models later this year with more software to assist educators prepare their students for the real world.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Talking about the device, Osterloh said "You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now. There is an annual rhythm in the industry, so you can count on us to follow it." The current generation Pixel devices weren't received well for their premium pricing. On that Osterloh had to say "Pixel stays premium." Google is currently facing inventory issues with the current Pixel phones, causing it to not be able to have the phone in stock most of the time.

On May 22, 1980 the now-iconic Pac-Man game was released in Japan by Namco Bandai Games. Originally called Puck Man, Pac-Man launched in the U.S. in October 1980 and went on to sell more than 100,000 units in its first year of production. Play Pac Man marks 30th anniversary The name of the game comes from the sound of eating, according to the official Pac-Man website. "Paku" is the Japanese sound for "chomp." Now the game is listed by Guinness World Records as the world's most successful coin-operated game. To help recognize the pop culture mainstay, at 11 a.m. ET today (midnight in Japan), Google turned its homepage over to a Pac-Man game that can be played for the next 48 hours. Visitors can click on the "insert coin" button or wait 10 seconds to automatically start the game, which reaches 256 levels. "Google doodler Ryan Germick and I made sure to include Pac-Man's original game logic, graphics and sounds, bring back ghosts' individual personalities, and even recreate original bugs from this 1980's masterpiece," said Marcin Wichary, senior user experience designer at Google and co-creator of the Pac-Man doodle. "Pac-Man seems like a natural fit for the Google homepage. They're both deceptively straightforward, carefully hiding their complexity under the hood. There's a light-hearted, human touch to both of them." To celebrate the anniversary, Namco has released championship editions for Apple's iPhone and iPad. Google posted its very first doodle in 1998 and its first animated doodle earlier this year to celebrate the birthday of Sir Isaac Newton (it showed an apple falling from a tree). Other popular Google doodles have recognized author H.G. Wells, the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and the changing seasons. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Google Doodle Celebrates Pac-Man's 30th +Tweeting Tchaikovsky on His Birthday +Google Doodle Mystery Solved: Happy Birthday, H.G.

Google last week released its E2EMail encryption code to open source as a way of pushing development of the technology. "Google has been criticized over the amount of time and seeming lack of progress it has made in E2EMail encryption, so open sourcing the code could help the project proceed more quickly," said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. That will not stop critics, as reactions to the decision have shown, he told LinuxInsider. However, it should enable the company to focus its attention and resources on issues it believes are more pressing, King added. Google started the E2EMail project more than a year ago, as a way to give users a Chrome app that would allow the simple exchange of private emails. The project integrates OpenPGP into Gmail via a Chrome extension. It brings improved usability and keeps all cleartext of the message body exclusively on the client. E2EMail is built on a proven, open source Javascript crypto library developed at Google, noted KB Sriram, Eduardo Vela Nava and Stephan Somogyi, members of Google's Security and Privacy Engineering team, in an online post. <a href="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=007a712380&amp;cb=14888798345774" ><img src="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538762539&amp;cs=007a712380&amp;cb=14888798345774" border="0" alt="" /></a> E2EMail Unwrapped The early versions of E2EMail are text-only and support only PGP/MIME messages. It now uses its own keyserver. The encryption application eventually will rely on Google's recent Key Transparency initiative for cryptographic key lookups. Google earlier this year released the project to open source with the aim of simplifying public key lookups at Internet scale. The Key Transparency effort addresses a usability challenge hampering mainstream adoption of OpenPGP. During installation, E2EMail generates an OpenPGP key and uploads the public key to the keyserver. The private key is always stored on the local machine. E2EMail uses a bare-bones central keyserver for testing. Google's Key Transparency announcement is crucial to its further evolution. Google Partially Benefits Secure messaging systems could benefit from open sourcing the system. Developers could use a directory when building apps to find public keys associated with an account along with a public audit log of any key changes. Encryption key discovery and distribution lie at the heart of the usability challenges that OpenPGP implementations have faced, suggested Sriram, Nava and Somogyi in their joint post. Key Transparency delivers a solid, scalable and practical solution. It replaces the problematic web-of-trust model traditionally used with PGP, they pointed out. "Google announced end-to-end email encryption almost three years ago, and no product or solution ever materialized," said Morey Haber, vice president of technology at BeyondTrust. "With this announcement, Google is making good on the promise of a Chrome extension that would seamlessly encrypt Gmail end-to-end," he told LinuxInsider. Since Google decided to open source the project, the technology will not remain proprietary for Chrome and Gmail, Haber added. Instead, Google no longer is working on this project, and the community will own the work and any potential derivatives. "This could be viewed as coming clean on a 3-year-old promise, or the release of a market perceived vaporware project. In either case, the techniques being used might spur some other innovation for similar messaging-type solutions," added Haber. Last Ditch Effort Google's decision to drop E2EMail and release it to open source might be the company's way of saving face, suggested Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. The best-case scenario is that sharing the project might inspire other developers and possibly improve security in general, he told LinuxInsider. "I think, like a lot of Google projects, Google lost interest in this one," Enderle continued, "and putting into open source is a way of at least allowing others to benefit from the effort. It is better than just shuttering the effort and archiving the work in a private repository." The impact of Google's decision to open source the project is difficult to assess, noted King. "Google has admitted that the issues surrounding end-to-end email encryption are far more complex that it originally assumed, so the code it has released is far from fully baked, he said. That makes its actual value hard to determine, King added, but bringing additional eyes and energy to the effort could help it progress more quickly. Solutions Still Needed About half of the email that traverses the Internet does so unencrypted, although that may not be the case for messaging and social media apps, suggested BeyondTrust's Haber. "Basic implementations of technology like this can be used to secure everything from banking statements to password resets," he said. Although Google's project never materialized into a product, the ideas and methodologies are good examples to learn from. "It will help educate people on techniques and potentially failed projects related to end-to-end encryption," Haber said, "but in the end, there are big problems to solve with key management and SHA1 collisions that researchers and security engineers should be focusing on."

Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Concordia Summit Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, considered one of the leading candidates for chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, has over the course of his campaigns received more than $60,000 in contributions from tech companies such as Facebook, Microsoft and Google. That means if President Donald Trump appoints Reyes to the FTC, there’s a chance Reyes would have to recuse himself from cases involving those companies, according to a source close to the FTC. Other FTC experts said the federal agency had little or no experience in dealing with commissioners who have received campaign contributions and if that would put him under pressure to recuse himself from cases. It’s still unclear if ethics regulations would apply in the case of campaign contributions, but experts say the issue for Reyes would come down to any appearance of conflict. As Utah’s attorney general, Reyes reported $2.2 million in campaign contributions going back to his first campaign in 2012, according to the office of the Utah Lieutenant Governor. He received roughly $1.9 million of those donations between 2014 and 2016. Of contributions between 2014 and 2016, he received a total of $25,000 from Facebook, $15,000 from Comcast*, $7,200 from Microsoft, $3,000 from Yelp, $2,500 from Google and at least $10,000 from a batch of other tech companies, according to campaign finance disclosures. Google and Yelp declined to comment for this story. Comcast and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment. Facebook directed Recode to its political engagement report. What makes this a potentially unusual circumstance for the FTC is it typically hasn’t seen former politicians serving on the agency. If appointed, Reyes’ past political life could complicate FTC cases going forward. Reyes’ campaign consultant, Alan Crooks, told Recode, “We haven’t reviewed any of those things at this time,” referring to the contributions from tech companies. “We’ll take a look at it if he’s actually called to be FTC chair.” The FTC declined to comment for this story. The commission is one of two key federal institutions, alongside the Department of Justice, with the authority to pursue antitrust action against companies, making it a focal point in watching how the Trump administration handles regulatory policies and actions of significance to the tech industry. Reyes gained attention after sources told Politico he was a top candidate for the role of chairman of the commission. Acting chair Maureen Ohlhausen has also gained support as a possible permanent appointee. Both are Republicans. In recent years, lobbyists have aggressively pursued attorneys general with campaign contributions to act in favor of their corporate clients, according to a 2014 investigation in the New York Times. The draw is that attorneys general typically face fewer restrictions and disclosure requirements than other elected officials. A commissioner involved in cases pertaining to companies that contributed to his political campaigns would create “an appearance of impropriety,” a source close to the FTC told Recode. “The issue of running campaigns and the political contributions that are part of those campaigns presents some unique issues for the Federal Trade Commission in terms of recusals on the one hand, and in terms of appearances on the other hand,” this person said. But another source, a Washington D.C. lawyer who used to work for the commission, told Recode campaign contributions are “just part of the fabric of our political system.” The person pointed out that appointed roles at other federal institutions have been filled by former politicians. Hillary Clinton, for example, was appointed Secretary of State after serving as senator from New York. “Suggesting that there’s a problem with this is really taking on the issue [of campaign contributions] generally,” the source said. This isn’t the first time questions have been raised about Reyes having an appearance of bias regarding tech companies. As attorney general, Reyes signed a letter a year ago suggesting the FTC revisit an investigation closed in 2013 into whether Google unfairly skewed search results to favor Google products. In the run-up to the nomination of an FTC chairman, companies engaged in conflicts with Google, including Yelp, have made efforts to promote his appointment, according to the Wall Street Journal. It should be noted that in addition to taking money from Google, Reyes has also taken money from Yelp, which has criticized Google for what it sees as anticompetitive practices. Whether Reyes would be pressured to recuse himself in cases involving companies that have contributed to his campaigns depends on an interpretation of the Code of Federal Regulations. The code’s ethics standards for executive branch employees requires them to “avoid an appearance of loss of impartiality” in doing their jobs. Failure to avoid the appearance of bias could result in a court decision being tossed, according to Wayne State University law professor Stephen Calkins, who served as general counsel to the FTC in the late ’90s. “At some point an affected party could claim that due process rights were violated,” he wrote in an email. In Reyes’ case, if the rule applied, Calkins said it would likely involve a part of the code which he describes as “vague, more general.” The line states: “An employee who is concerned that circumstances other than those specifically described in this section would raise a question regarding his impartiality should use the process described in this section to determine whether he should or should not participate in a particular matter.” A previous FTC commissioner recently recused himself in cases involving Google, but for different reasons. Joshua Wright, who left the FTC in 2015, recused himself from matters involving Google because he had accepted funding from the company for some of his previous research papers. The Law and Economics Center at George Mason University, where Wright was a professor, received $762,000 in donations from Google from 2011 to 2013, according to Salon. But Wright’s recusal likely stemmed from a different part of the federal code and may not apply to Reyes, according to Calkins. It’s difficult to predict how ethics standards would be applied to Reyes because the FTC has rarely, if ever, had to consider ethics surrounding campaign contributions, Calkins said. Historically, it’s rare for the commission to appoint members who have held elected office. Seattle University School of Law professor John Kirkwood, who worked for the FTC for 25 years, said he couldn’t recall a single commissioner who had previously been an elected official. “I doubt the FTC has much, if any, experience deciding whether a political contribution requires recusal,” he wrote in an email to Recode. Calkins identified one commissioner who held a seat in Congress before joining the FTC — John Gwynne, who was appointed to the commission in 1953. Calkins did not look into earlier commissioners. Reyes has faced questions about the impact of campaign contributions on his actions as attorney general in Utah. In 2015, critics raised concerns about a $5,000 contribution Reyes received from contact lens company 1-800 Contacts, which benefited from a law he was defending. Reyes’ campaign consultant Crooks told the Associated Press the contribution was consistent with past donations from the company, and that Reyes was required as attorney general to defend any laws passed in the state. The company, 1-800 Contacts, is currently fighting a lawsuit waged against it by the FTC alleging anticompetitive practices, as the New York Post previously reported. * Comcast’s NBCUniversal is a minority investor in Vox Media, which owns Recode.

The new Assistant is Google’s version of Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Amazon’s Alexa. Although late into the AI game, Google Assitant has one major advantage over every other AI-based digital assistant software: the Google/Android connection. Google, who has been branching out of its humble search engine beginnings for years, bought Android in 2005. This seemingly simple move allowed Google to expand from desktops to smartphones. According to Quartz, Android hit a record-breaking 88 percent of the smartphone market last year. Android’s success can be attributed to partnering with many smartphone manufacturing partners, while Apple’s IOS has a much smaller market share since it is only available on Apple devices. However, the Google Assistant was not supposed to be used throughout the entire Android universe. Google’s initial strategy was to roll out the Google Assistant on Pixel (Google’s high-end smartphone), and Google Home. Google changed their strategy when Amazon’s Alexa made it even easier to shop online. Since Shopify reports that retail eCommerce sales are projected to grow to over 3.4 trillion US dollars by 2019, Amazon clearly wanted to capture a larger piece of that ever-growing market. Amazon pushed to install Alexa in a wide variety of IoT products was Google’s motivation to change tactics, as reported by CNBC. “The U.S. technology giant’s move comes after Amazon continues to aggressively push Alexa onto new devices. At CES, Amazon announced Alexa would be integrated with LG refrigerators and even Ford cars. But it began to step on Google’s feet when Amazon announced that Alexa would be on the Huawei Mate 9 smartphone in the U.S., which runs Android. “Amazon has taken an early lead with Alexa and Google needs to exploit the enormous reach of Android smartphones to rapidly get the Google Assistant into the hands of consumers before they get wedded to the Alexa ecosystem.” [Image by guvendemir /iStock] The race to dominate the AI market quickly forced Google to tap into its huge Android market. According to a report by Pocket-lint, Google has confirmed Google Assistant will be available for Android 7.0 Nougat and 6.0 Marshmallow phones, including: Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy S7 edge HTC 10 HTC U Ultra LG G5 LG V20 Sony Xperia XZ Huawei P9 Google has also released Google Allo, a messaging app that uses Assistant technology. This would allow more Android phones to use Assistant, again increasing Google’s share of the market. One slight issue, according to a CNET review, is that “Allo doesn’t integrate video calling, and it doesn’t have as many features as its competitors, like baked-in GIF support or control over read receipts.” [Image by Eric Risberg/AP Images] As technology changes and evolves, the innovations will continue to push the envelope and try to find new ways to connect with consumers. Google is the king of connecting consumers and businesses. Google’s search engine is designed to be incredibly helpful while selling advertising. Now that technology allows us to shop, search, talk, and work anywhere, tech companies will keep installing AI in places that will increase profits. By 2021, the number of internet-connected devices is predicted to reach 46 billion. In the race to become the leader of voice-activated AI, Google has a clear advantage in its huge Android market. With an 88% of the smartphone market, Google should be the clear leader. However, 9TO5Mac reports that “Apple made more revenue from iPhone in a single quarter than Google has ever made from Android.” So while Google is poised on the brink of dominating the market with its new Assistant, Google’s Android advantage may not be enough to squash its competitors.

What a week! The annual Mobile World Congress (MWC) took place in Barcelona from Monday to Thursday, and there was no shortage of big announcements at that event – but there was plenty of exciting news and developments across the rest of the tech world too. If (somehow!) you’re not familiar with MWC, this quick video intro from the beginning of the week should give you some idea of what it’s all about: If you struggled to keep up with everything that’s been happening this week, don’t worry – 7 Days is here again to walk you through the week’s top tech news. There’s a lot to get through this week, so let’s waste no more time! The new BlackBerry KEYone was among the many new devices unveiled at (or immediately before) MWC. The $549 upper-mid-range Android 7.0 handset was designed and built by TCL, which referred to it as a 'flagship', although it doesn't have the specs to match rival flagship-class handsets from other manufacturers. There's plenty to like about the new device, though - and you can get a first look at it in my hands-on video from the launch event (I hope you like videos, because there's lot more of them coming up!). Reports have since emerged of up to three more BlackBerry-branded devices on the way this year, including photos of one with a very different design to the KEYone. In off-camera conversations at the KEYone launch event, several BlackBerry staff hinted to me that a 'true' flagship is in development, possibly with a Snapdragon 835 processor. The stunning new LG G6 also made its debut at MWC, featuring an unusually wide 5.7-inch Quad HD+ display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Along with a stylish metallic body, it also features a Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB RAM and up to 64GB storage, along with IP68 dust- and water-resistance and a fingerprint sensor. I'm already a fan of this device, especially its dual 13MP rear cameras which are capable of snapping some great shots. Check out my hands-on video with the LG G6 here. Huawei introduced its new P10 and P10 Plus flagships just before MWC at a rather poorly organized event which left hundreds of journalists standing outside the venue for hours, long after the event had already begun. During the announcement itself, Huawei spent around half an hour talking about the many colors of the new handsets, so perhaps those of us left outside were the lucky ones. Nonetheless, the new P10 family are beautiful handsets with plenty of high-end specs, and a new version of Huawei's dual-camera technology co-engineered with imaging specialists Leica. You can find my hands-on video for the P10 here. Alongside the P10, Huawei also announced the Watch 2 and Watch 2 Classic, its new Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches, which include IP68 protection, a dazzling array of color options and all sorts of premium specs and features. The Watch 2 also includes integrated 4G LTE connectivity. Nokia was one of the biggest stars of MWC this year - quite a turnaround from what appeared to be the end of its mobile ambitions following the sale of its devices business to Microsoft in 2014. Among its many announcements in Barcelona, Nokia revealed that it's killing off the Withings brand for its wearable devices, in favor of its own brand. The Nokia 6 Android smartphone - designed and developed by HMD Global, built by Foxconn, and sold under the Nokia brand - launched in China in December. At MWC, HMD announced that it will soon be launching the 6 internationally, priced around €229 EUR. HMD also unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5, its new entry-level and mid-range handsets, respectively. You can view the full specs for both devices here, and as I discussed in my hands-on video with the two new Android smartphones, they appear hugely impressive - especially considering their relatively low prices. But the biggest attraction at Nokia's MWC stand was a blast from the past. HMD announced a new version of its much-loved classic phone, the Nokia 3310, updated with a range of more modern features. Every time I visited or walked past the Nokia stand, it was packed with people of all ages - including those too young to remember the original - wanting to get their hands on the new 3310. As you'll see in my hands-on video with the device, it's far from perfect - but there's a lot to like about it. It even includes a new version of the old-school Snake game, which is also coming to Facebook. Archos showed off its new low-cost Android 7.0 tablet. Despite being aimed at budget-conscious buyers, the 101 Saphir offers some rather nice features, including dust- and water-resistance, and a rugged design offering some protection against drops. Samsung had already confirmed that its new Galaxy S8 flagship wouldn't appear at MWC, but the company did announce the launch date for the new handset. And the leaks about the Galaxy S8 just keep coming - new images have emerged twice in the last few days. Samsung revealed its new rugged Galaxy XCover 4 smartphone with a 5-inch 720p display, IP68 rating, and MIL-STD-810G impact protection. It will ship in Europe with Android 7.0 onboard from April, priced around €259. Samsung also introduced a new version of its Gear VR headset, co-developed with Oculus, featuring a new controller with improved navigation. Samsung's new Galaxy Tab S3 made its first official appearance at MWC too. The high-end Android tablet has a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM and 32GB storage, along with a keyboard cover and S Pen stylus support. And Samsung showed off its new Windows 10 2-in-1, the Galaxy Book, which comes in two configurations: a Windows 10 Home model with 10.6-inch LCD and 7th-gen Intel Core m3 processor; and a Windows 10 Pro version with a 12-inch Super AMOLED display and 7th-gen Core i5. Both models support 4G LTE and come with a keyboard and S Pen stylus. You can get more info on both variants in my hands-on video here. Porsche Design revealed its new premium Windows 10 laptop. Unlike Samsung's Galaxy Book - which is a tablet with detachable keyboard cover - Porsche Design's new Book One is an actual notebook (albeit with a detachable display!). It's conceptually similar to Microsoft's Surface Book, and features Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. Panasonic showed off its latest Toughbook, an ultra-rugged Windows 10 detachable that's waterproof and has a briefcase-style carrying handle. It's packed full of the latest high-end specs - but it will come at quite a high price. Alcatel introduced its Plus12 Windows 10 2-in-1 aimed primarily at business buyers on a budget. It features some pretty modest specs, but - as you'll see in my hands-on video - it also has one of the worst keyboards I've encountered for some time. Alcatel's Idol 4S with Windows 10 has been available in the US for months, but the company finally announced its European launch this week, priced at €599. For some reason, the device has been rebranded as the 'Idol 4 Pro' for Europe, but the Windows 10 Mobile flagship's features are identical to those of its US counterpart. Image via PC World Our friends over at PC World spotted a refreshed version of HP's Elite x3 Windows 10 Mobile flagship that had accidentally appeared on its stand at MWC. However, when I went down there to check it out, the company had removed it from view, and its staff rather joylessly refused to say anything about it, brusquely parroting the phrase "we haven't announced anything". Still, HP did announce new accessories for the Elite x3, as well as revealing the Pro x2 612 G2, a premium 12-inch 2-in-1 targeting enterprise customers. The Elite x3 also received a firmware update this week, bringing performance improvements and camera optimizations. Lenovo unveiled a range of new Android devices aimed at families, including some features designed with kids in mind... ...as well as a selection of new Windows 10 devices covering a wide range of price points. The Miix 320 - which is priced as low as $199.99 USD - was my personal favorite, offering some very nice features, along with rock-solid build quality. But the new additions to the Lenovo range include a 14-inch Yoga 520 notebook, and two flagship-class Yoga 720 convertibles with stylus support, stylish design, and beautiful displays. You can get an overview of all four of those new Lenovo Windows 10 devices in my hands-on video. Lenovo's rather lovely new G5 and G5 Plus mid-range smartphones were revealed at MWC too. They offer a decent set of specs combined with some thoughtful design features, along with stylish looks. The G5 was one of my personal favorites at MWC - you can see my impressions of both handsets in my hands-on video. Sony revealed four new Xperia devices in Barcelona, including two high-end handsets, the Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZs. The Premium features Sony's Motion Eye camera technology which offers slow motion video capture at up to 960fps. But perhaps the most exciting device on Sony's stand was the Xperia Touch, a €1,500 EUR device running Android 7.0 that projects its user interface onto a flat surface, turning it into a 23-inch touch display. The projector is portable too, but it currently offers just one hour of battery life. Find out more about that device in my hands-on video here. Jolla announced that it has added support for its Sailfish OS on some of Sony's Xperia devices. The company also revealed plans to build a local mobile OS aimed specifically at China. Chinese manufacturer ZTE revealed its new Blade V8 Lite and Mini handsets, offering lesser specs in a more affordable package than the Blade V8 Pro that it announced at CES in January. Xiaomi showed off its new Mi 5c featuring the company's own Surge S1 processor, along with 3GB RAM, 64GB storage and a 5.5-inch display. Xiaomi also introduced its new Redmi 4X, a low-cost smartphone with Qualcomm's latest mid-range Snapdragon 435 chipset, and a very spacious 4100mAh battery, priced from as little as $102. Meanwhile, General Mobile debuted the GM6, the latest handset to launch under Google's Android One initiative. While the new devices were the major focus of attention at MWC, they weren't the only big announcements at the show. Meizu, for example, revealed its new Super mCharge battery technology with a live demo in which it charged a flagship phone with a 3000mAh battery from 0% to 100% in just 18 minutes. And in a year when 'the next big thing' was the subject of endless discussion at MWC, the International Telecommunication Union released a draft report detailing the specifications of the next-generation 5G mobile standard, promising 20Gbps download speeds and latency as low as 1ms. Image via Shutterstock The GSM Association, which hosts the Mobile World Congress expo each year, published its annual Mobile Economy report, in which it estimated that there will be five billion mobile users by mid-2017. Moving on from MWC, fresh details emerged this week of Apple's plans for its 'Anniversary iPhone', which is due to arrive later this year. The Wall Street Journal reported that the new handset will include a curved AMOLED screen along with USB Type-C support, while a separate report suggested that Apple is investing heavily in augmented reality technology for the device. Nvidia announced details of its new GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU, with a whopping 11GB of GDDR5X memory. Pre-orders opened on Thursday, and deliveries will begin on March 10. The Raspberry Pi Foundation marked the fifth anniversary of its original maker board by announcing a new variant of the ultra-low-cost Raspberry Pi Zero, which now features 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 for just $10. Elsewhere, an intrepid developer built a Raspberry Pi wearable device running Windows 98 (!!). Developer Michael Darby said: "I thought, wouldn’t it be ridiculous and awesome to have Windows 98 on my wrist?" Yes, Michael - "ridiculous and awesome" is the exact phrase I would have chosen. Love it! <3 "Hello, computer" There was much rejoicing among Star Trek fans in January when Amazon added 'Computer' as a wake-word for its Alexa digital assistant. Now, the company is apparently preparing to add new capabilities to Alexa, including voice calling functionality. Google has started to bring its digital Assistant to millions more Android devices, after initially limiting it to its Pixel phones, Android Wear devices, and its Home speaker hub. And the long wait for Google Home to launch in the UK will soon be over. The company announced that it will launch there in June, although pricing hasn't yet been revealed. There's been some confusion surrounding the future of Google's Pixel laptops running Chrome OS. At a roundtable with reporters at MWC, Google gave the clear impression that it would not launch any more of its own-branded Chromebooks - but a few days later, it stated that its Pixel laptops aren't dead after all. However, Google did confirm that it will definitely be launching new Pixel smartphones later this year. Google's Nougat update continued to slowly make its way to more devices around the world in recent days: Droid Turbo 2 on Verizon gets Android 7.0 update Android 7.0 begins rolling out to the Moto G4 and G4 Plus in the US You can now sign up for the Honor 6X beta program to get Android 7.0 Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta finally heads to the Nexus 6P OnePlus 3 and 3T get Android 7.1.1 beta in China (HydrogenOS) and other markets (OxygenOS) Microsoft updated its Arrow Launcher for Android to version 3.0, calling it the "biggest release yet", bringing new features and major performance enhancements. A couple of days later, it rolled out beta version 3.1, bringing support for Android tablets. We got a small taste of what might have been for Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile flagships, as a series of screenshots revealed support for unique gestures originally intended for inclusion on the Lumia 950 and 950 XL - some of which may have been developed as part of the stillborn Lumia McLaren project. Skype for Linux emerged from the alpha phase of its development with the release of a new beta that included all sorts of improvements and new features. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced that it is discontinuing its Skype WiFi service at the end of this month - and it's not yet clear what the future holds for the separate Microsoft WiFi offering. Microsoft Edge's share of the desktop browser market remains more or less stagnant, while Chrome has extended its lead from 57.94% to 58.53%, according to the latest data from NetMarketShare. NetMarketShare data also showed zero growth (in fact, a very slight decline) for Windows 10, while Windows 7's share of the desktop market grew from 47.20% last month to 48.41% this month. A similar picture was painted by the latest usage stats from gaming platform Steam, where Windows 10 usage declined by almost 1% in the last month, while Windows 7 increased. A new version of Windows 10's iconic 'hero' desktop wallpaper was spotted in the latest build of Windows 10 Cloud - and there's some speculation that the updated version may be unique to the Cloud SKU of the OS. A Windows 10 Cloud build that leaked earlier this week included the ability for users to download and install Win32 apps from the Windows Store. The upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update will include the option to prevent users from installing any apps except those downloaded from the Windows Store, in an effort to improve on-device security. Microsoft outlined details of new controls over Windows Update that will be introduced with the Creators Update in the next few weeks. These will include more granular controls for when to schedule updates and associated reboots. Thanks to Microsoft's new Unified Update Platform, or UUP, future updates for Windows Insiders could see download sizes reduced by up to 65%. It's been a busy week for Windows Insiders, with numerous new builds being released. After Windows 10 build 15046 brought new features to PCs in the Fast ring on Tuesday, Microsoft rolled out build 15048 to Fast ring PCs on Friday, along with build 15047 to Windows 10 Mobile devices. Build 15043 also made its way to Windows 10 Mobile handsets in the Slow ring on Thursday - the first Slow ring build for those devices since December. On top of that, Windows 10 SDK Preview build 15042 was released on Wednesday... ...along with ISOs for Windows 10 build 15042 for PCs. Microsoft introduced Wake-on-LAN support for its Surface devices when used in conjunction with a Surface Ethernet adapter or dock - a very welcome addition, and rather a long time coming! Microsoft also announced general availability of Visio Online on Wednesday, following several months in public preview. Coinciding with that announcement, it also added a couple of new features. The Movies & TV app on Windows 10 (known as Films & TV in the United Kingdom) was updated for Windows Insiders to include support for 360-degree video, along with some other improvements. However, in less welcome news, Microsoft slashed its OneDrive storage allowances on Wednesday. The company had previously announced plans to remove its 'unlimited' storage plan, blaming customers for using too much of their unlimited allowance. All customers who previously had an unlimited or 10TB allowance will now see their storage reduced to just 1TB. Here's everything you need to know about the implications of those changes. And Microsoft announced a further change on Wednesday, ditching its Windows Holographic brand in favor of 'Windows Mixed Reality'. The new name sounds rather bland in comparison to the old one, but it was a necessary change, given that the virtual reality headsets that run the OS offer none of the 'holographic' elements available on augmented reality devices like HoloLens. Microsoft confirmed to Neowin on Wednesday that it will be bringing mixed reality experiences to both its current Xbox One consoles, and to its new Project Scorpio console, in 2018. It will begin shipping mixed reality dev kits this month, including a headset manufactured by Acer. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced its new Xbox Game Pass, a $10 monthly subscription offering unlimited access to over 100 games for Xbox owners. The new service will be launching this Spring, and you can check out all the games that will be available on day one here. Xbox One Insider Preview build 15039 was released to the Beta ring last weekend, while build 15045 made its way to the Alpha ring on Tuesday with several new features. Build 15046 was pushed to the Alpha ring on Thursday with various fixes for a range of issues. Over 1,000 games are currently being created by developers under the ID@Xbox program; on Wednesday, Microsoft announced details of 22 of those games that are coming to both the Xbox One and Windows 10. Battlefield 1 is free to play this weekend for Xbox Live Gold subscribers, and will also be available to buy with a hefty discount. But after a wonderful and exciting week, our odyssey across the tech world ends this week on a truly sad note. Last weekend, gamer Brian Vigneault died in the final hours of a 24-hour gaming marathon. He was live-streaming his gaming session on Twitch in an effort to raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which arranges memorable and happy experiences for terminally ill children. 22 hours into his marathon, the 35-year-old took a break from the stream, but never returned. Brian had previously raised over $11,000 for non-profits during the course of five years as a charity live-streamer. The thoughts of the whole Neowin team are with his family and friends. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Timi Cantisano reviewed the unusual GPD WIN, a handheld computer with a built-in QWERTY keyboard, and gaming controls, including a direction pad, thumbsticks and ABXY buttons. That's definitely worth a read! Byron Hinson published his review of Sniper Elite 4, which is available on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. The game isn't for the squeamish as it can get a bit gory at times, but Byron found it to be a lot of fun, although it can become a bit repetitive. Check out his full review here. And after an action-packed week at Mobile World Congress, crammed full of big announcements, we're eager to hear your thoughts on what was revealed at the event. Was there a particular device that you're looking forward to buying? A new technology that you're keen to try out? A new machine that you're determined to save up for and treat yourself to? Or just something that you really like the look of? Join in the discussion, and have your say! ...and finally, don't forget that you can check out all of our coverage from Mobile World Congress right here. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

Meanwhile, Amazon could be releasing a voice-activated Alexa camera soon.  On Thursday, Android Police reported about what it found after looking into the APK of Google Home’s latest update. The teardown revealed a couple of empty strings that act as placeholders for what Google is working on. The prefix “mu” — short for multi-user — in the names of these strings provide proof that multi-user is coming to the device soon. The Android-centric news site claims the strings would soon be used to launch a feature that would allow consumers to add multiple accounts to Google Home and possibly set up voice recognition profiles for the users.  Although these strings are clearly suggesting multi-user support, there is no telling if Google will push this feature to its smart speakers anytime soon. For now, Google has added support for Google Home users to view the list of alarms and timers set on the speaker via the Home app. Users can access the list from a smartphone and do some changes to the alarms and timer from there. Meanwhile, Amazon is now rumored to be developing a different kind of AI hardware. AFTVnews exclusively reported about a small home security camera it found on Amazon’s website.The site claims that this camera could be Amazon’s new creation that is going to rival the Nest Cam. Unlike the latter, the device could be running the Alexa AI assistant, making it a smart camera instead of just being an indoor security camera. The camera that AFTVnews spotted appears to have 4 infrared LEDs for night vision. Surrounding its camera lens is a blue light ring that’s reminiscent of the light ring on the Amazon Echo. Atop the device are two holes that are believed to be microphones. And, of course, it has built-in speakers. Given all of these specs and features, it’s not that hard to imagine that Amazon could be introducing a smart camera soon.  Google HomeMore Google Home could get support for multiple accounts soon.

Live Watch Loch Ness Monster on Google Earth? By KI MAE HEUSSNER NED POTTER Aug. 28, 2009 0 Shares Email Star Google.com Loch Ness spotted on Google Earth. 0 Shares Email Millions have traveled to the shores of Scotland's Loch Ness, hoping to catch a rare glimpse of the world's most famous lake monster. But earlier this week, a British man revealed that he spied the legendary Loch Ness monster while searching Google Earth from his very own home. Jason Cooke, 25, a security guard from Nottingham, England, told the U.K.'s Sun that he spotted the monster while scanning the site's satellite imagery. Play null "I couldn't believe it. It's just like the descriptions of Nessie," he said. The first recorded sighting of the monster was nearly 1,500 years ago when a giant beast is said to have leaped out of a lake near Inverness, Scotland, and ate a local farmer. Since then, the myth of the Loch Ness monster has only magnified. In 1934, a London doctor snapped a photograph that seemed to show a dinosaur-looking creature with a long neck emerging from the water. Then a home movie from 1960 showed a strange figure swimming in the water behind a family picnicking, although British intelligence later analyzed the film and concluded the figure was likely "something inanimate." Of the millions of people who have looked into Loch Ness searching for something within, about 1,000 visitors have reported unusual sightings. Unfortunately for Nessie-trackers, the "monster" spotted by Cooke looks an awful lot like a boat. But if you'd like to check it out for yourself, enter the following coordinates in Google Earth: Latitude 57°12'52.13"N, Longitude 4°34'14.16"W. ABCNews.com has gone to the ends of Google Earth (and Maps) to explore some of the most interesting images left behind by Google staffers, artists, Mother Nature and a few pranksters as well. The Loch Ness "monster" is only the latest wonder to surface. Here are a few other favorites, from the serious to the frivolous. Google on Moon Not content to have become one of the most powerful information sources on this planet, engineers at Google recently conquered the Moon. To mark the 40th anniversary this year of Apollo 11, Google's engineers partnered with NASA to add a new layer to their popular -- and free -- mapping program, Google Earth. They inserted a detailed map of the lunar surface, as imaged by U.S. satellites. It becomes especially rich in material at the six sites where U.S. astronauts landed between 1969 and 1972, and where various robotic probes touched down in advance of Apollo. To use it, one has to download the newest version of Google Earth, found HERE. It is separate from (and more detailed than) the lunar maps already found on the Google Web site; those have been there for about four years. "I believe that this educational tool is a critical step into the future, a way to both develop the dreams of young people globally, and inspire new audacious goals," wrote Anousheh Ansari, the sponsor of the Ansari X Prize, and the first woman to travel in orbit as a space "tourist," on Google's blog. "Finally, outer space doesn't seem so far away anymore." Heart-Shaped Lakes and 10-Foot Snakes Arizona's Oprah Maze She's one of the biggest stars on the planet, so it only makes sense that she has a special place in Google Earth, too. Arizona's Schnepf Farms carves a maze with the outline of a famous person into its 10-acre cornfield each year around Halloween. Larry King, Jay Leno and Steve Nash are among the celebrities who have been recognized in this way. In 2004, Oprah Winfrey was the farm's celebrity of choice. Heart-Shaped Lake Google's Frank Taylor and Google Sightseeing's James Turnbull said there's a lot of love on Google Earth. They've compiled whole collections of heart-shaped things seen from space, as well as a handful of visible marriage proposals. This heart-shaped lake in Ohio is just one of several like it found by members of the Google Earth community. Man Walking His Snake Leon Kidd, 25, was photographed carrying his 10-foot boa Nibblez along a road in Norwich last summer, the U.K.'s Telegraph reported Wednesday. Norwich is one of 25 U.K. cities included in Google Street View, which lets users see cities and neighborhoods virtually from their computers. Kidd, who owns five snakes, told the Telegraph that walking his boa is regular activity. "I take her out nearly every day in summer in Earlham Park," he said. "A lot of people are surprised, others are curious and ask if they can touch her. She loves being taken out, especially going in the grass." "I didn't even notice I was being photographed by the Google car," he said. "Then about three weeks ago my cousin phoned me and said I was in the newspaper." Firefox Crop Circles In a bid to generate some PR buzz for the Web browser in 2006, some Firefox fans made a gigantic Firefox logo in a crop field. According to the Google Earth blog, the project involved significant planning, building of the crop stompers, GPS devices and a helicopter (to capture the aerial photo). This crop circle is one of a large collection of crop circles visible through Google Earth. Jesus in the Sand Dunes In 2005, the Google Earth blogs were chattering about reports of the face of Jesus in Peruvian sand dunes. Some say they don't see the resemblance to Jesus Christ, but others still wonder about the origins of the hazy image. Googling for Gold Los Angeles musician Nathan Smith believes a 19th century Spanish galleon laden with gold and silver is buried on a ranch in south Texas. He is convinced he found its location using Google Earth. The only problem now? If the ship does exist, it is buried on private property. The family that owns the land doesn't want anyone digging up their property for a ship no one has proved even exists. Citing Maritime Law, on Land "It has been my experience, more times than not, a legend like this, there is some basis of truth," Smith said. "Because it has been around long enough that they have named it Barkentine Creek. That alone makes me think that there was, or is, something buried out there." A barkentine is a kind of sailing ship. Smith has brought the landowners to federal court in a case titled Smith vs. Abandoned Ship, and has argued he has the right under maritime law to dig up a ranch he doesn't own looking for a ship no one is sure exists. Lost City of Atlantis? Using the latest version of Google Earth, which allows users to peer under the sea, a British engineer believed he spotted the lost city of Atlantis off the coast of Africa, about 600 miles from the Canary Islands. The image on Google Earth appears to show a grid-like pattern, which some have said resembles a planned city. The ancient city was first mentioned by the Greek philosopher Plato, and legend holds it sank into the sea. The exact location of the city, and whether such a place even existed, has obsessed treasure hunters for centuries. Google, however, had a much less exciting explanation for the undersea pattern. "It's true that many amazing discoveries have been made in Google Earth, including a pristine forest in Mozambique that is home to previously unknown species and the remains of an ancient Roman villa," a statement from Google read. "In this case, however, what users are seeing is an artifact of the data collection process. "Bathymetric [or sea-floor terrain] data is often collected from boats using sonar to take measurements of the sea floor," the statement added. "The lines reflect the path of the boat as it gathers the data." Pool Dipping In the summer, Google Earth helped British teenagers start a new craze: pool dipping. The cunning teens used Google Earth to find homes with pools and then organized pool parties using social networking sites. This led a police representative to tell the U.K. Telegraph, "We are advising owners of swimming pools to be on their guard and extra vigilant. We would also warn prospective swimmers that using someone else's pool is trespassing and therefore illegal." Street Party The street view in Google Maps typically shows the humdrum life of U.S. intersections and alleyways, but two Pittsburgh artists, with the help of more than 100 co-conspirators, threw a street party for the entire Internet in May 2008. Timing various public performances along one street, Sampsonia Way, as a Google-owned car drove by snapping pictures, the artists, Ben Kinsley and Robin Hewlett, were able to create a montage of spontaneous performances. Google had already shot its Pittsburgh street views, but agreed to come back to shoot the art installation. The company said it wouldn't guarantee that it would use the new images, but when Kinsley looked, there they were. ABC News' Nick Watt contributed to this report. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Loch Ness Monster on Google Earth? +Latest Google 'Wonder' Out of This World +Snake Stroller Joins Google Earth Wonders " New satellite imaging allows unprecedented tracking of lightning strikes German court to rule in refugee's Facebook lawsuit Business group: China tech plan threat to foreign firms Pennsylvania Senate Democrats resist ransom in cyberattack Scientists tweak seat cushion material to clean oil spills Zap Map: Satellite tracks lightning for better heads up " World's 1st woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, turns 80 Fitbit tracks your steps; now it wants to chart your Zs, too Hackers drawn to energy sector's lack of sensors, controls " House Republicans unveil Obamacare replacement plan " Exxon announces expansion program, Trump takes credit US setting up missile defense system in South Korea " North Korea, Malaysia step up dispute over Kim's death " Wedding ring attached to beads thrown in Fat Tuesday parade " Texas grandpa builds amusement park in backyard " Pregnant woman re-enacts giraffe livestream wearing mask " These mushers brave ice, snow and freezing temps to compete in Alaska’s Iditarod dogsled race " Journalist throws up during plane proposal to girlfriend " Young couple finds it 'freeing' to travel the country in a converted van " Dobby the newborn giraffe gets plasma treatment to bolster immune system

You can find the island on Google Maps, just south of the equator in the Pacific Ocean. Sadly, the actual island isn’t displayed on the map; it’s just a point in the middle of the ocean. You can leave a review, though. The company has done some fun stuff with its maps before, bringing its Street View cameras into the Batcave (Ben Affleck Edition), into Doctor Who’s TARDIS, and to Harry Potter’s Diagon Alley.

By Gary Jones / Published 5th March 2017 GOOGLE The Google Pixel 2 will be released in 2017, facing the Samsung Galaxy S8 The Google Pixel 2 is currently being worked on as the next Google Phone to launch in 2017. That’s according to the company’s SVP of hardware, Rick Osterloh, who revealed the big news during a press event at Mobile World Congress earlier this week. The company is set to reveal the Google Pixel 2 later this year and will remain a “premium” device. “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it,” Osterloh commented. “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” Rumours of the Google Pixel 2 first emerged earlier this year, with the device expected to feature a number of hardware improvements on the first-generation device. Samsung Galaxy S8 - Leaked photos and concept images REVEALED Tuesday, 17th January 2017 SAMSUNG'S Galaxy S8 looks set to be unveiled in April and here's how it could look. 1 / 15 PH Samsung Galaxy S8 in pictures This will include a more powerful processor, as well as more memory and storage. It’s rumored that Google is carrying out several tests at the moment with different processors, including the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon chips and specialised Intel hardware. Despite the latest update, Google is set to feature renewed smartphone competition in the coming weeks, with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 both set to launch in the not too distant future. The Samsung Galaxy S8 release date is still weeks away, but now a major new leak has revealed everything you could want to know about the new phone. Having already been the subject of multiple leaks and countless rumours, the entire Galaxy S8 specs sheet has now emerged online. Revealing all the inner workings of the upcoming iPhone rival, the leaked specs sheets has confirmed the eagerly awaited handset is going to be something truly special. Related Articles Major Samsung Galaxy S8 leak reveals phone's entire specs sheet and it's amazing Google Chrome Warning - This serious scam could put your online activity at risk BlackBerry KEYone launched - Iconic smartphone maker is back with shock iPhone 7 rival Surfaced via tech blog TechnoBuffalo, the comprehensive Galaxy S8 leak also shows how similar the phone will be to the Galaxy S8+, with the larger phone having seen its full features list emerge earlier this week. Kicking things off with the screen, the S8 looks set to be a visual delight with a 5.8-inch QHD panel set to boast a stunning 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. This panel will curve around both the phone's left and right hand edges and will be squeezed in to a phone with near identical dimensions to last year's 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 thanks to a new edge-to-edge design made possible by killing off the physical home button on the phone's lower front edge. Elsewhere the phone, which like its predecessor will be water and dust resistant, will play host to a 12MP dual pixel primary camera and a new 8-megapixel selfie shooter that'll be enhanced by its own integrated flash. That's not all the front camera will be capable of, either. Partnered with a new iris scanner, the phone will be capable of being unlocked just by looking at it, with the camera helping read the unique pattern within your eye.

By By Marisa Kendall, San Jose Mercury News Feb 28, 2017 at 3:12 pm | Print View SAN FRANCISCO — Still reeling from claims that its leaders failed to respond to sexism and inappropriate behavior in the office, Uber on Monday dismissed one of its senior executives after learning he had been accused of sexual harassment while working at Google. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick asked Amit Singhal, his vice president of engineering, to resign after learning about the Google incident, an Uber spokeswoman said. Singhal on Monday denied the allegations and said he left Google for other reasons. The leadership shakeup comes at a time of crisis for Uber, as the $68 billion ride-hailing giant continues to face intense national scrutiny after a former engineer earlier this month alleged in a post on her website that the company protected a manager who propositioned her for sex. In an emailed statement, Singhal acknowledged he had been accused of sexual harassment while at Google, but denied that was the reason he left the company in February of last year. “Harassment is unacceptable in any setting,” he wrote in a statement sent through a New York-based media relations company. “I certainly want everyone to know that I do not condone and have not committed such behavior. In my 20-year career, I’ve never been accused of anything like this before and the decision to leave Google was my own.” Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before joining Uber just over a month ago, Singhal spent 15 years as Google’s senior vice president of search. He is largely credited as one of the brains behind the company’s search capabilities. He left Google in February 2016, saying in a public goodbye note that he wanted to focus on philanthropy and spend more time with his family.

M Tuesday, Mar 07 2017 | Updated at 04:38 AM EST Stay Connected With Us F T R Opinion Academics Students Special Reports Sports Finance Tech Career College Mar 04, 2017 12:54 PM EST By Donna Mills, UniversityHerald Reporter Google Assistant’s Deeper iOS Integration; Instructions On Proper Installation Via APK Google Assistant may be deeply integrated into Apple's iOS devices in the near future. Android owners need to have the latest version of Google Play services (APK v. 10.2.98 or higher) to get the virtual assistant. (Photo : Ramin Talaie/Getty Images) Android devices running Marshmallow and Nougat are now receiving Google Assistant, an intelligent personal assistant that can sustain conversations. Google Assistant is also expected to make its way into Apple's iOS devices soon. Google Assistant was initially exclusive to Pixel and Pixel XL handsets but is now supporting 32 percent of Android phones (or 500 million Android handsets) in the market, AndroidCentral reported from Google's official announcement of the virtual assistant on YouTube. That includes the latest handsets from Huawei, LG, Sony and Motorola, among others. Android Wear 2, Google Home, Android TV and Android Auto will receive the functionality, too. Users don't need to seek approval from phone manufacturers and carriers to have Google Assistant. They only need to long press their device's home button to activate it -- a process similar to Google Now's. Android owners, however, need to have the latest version of Google Play services (APK v. 10.2.98 or higher) to get the new feature. The rollout will continue throughout this week, so don't worry if you still don't have the virtual assistant as of this moment. For those of you who don't know the exact Google Play services version that your Android device needs, download Play Services info or check out your handset's Settings - Apps - Google Play services. Once there, take note of the three-digit sequences enclosed in the parentheses. Play Services info is an app created by a third-party developer called Weberdo. The app displays the version of Google Play services running on your device, and also indicates if there's a new version available for download. The new version is shown via a link to APK mirror or Google Play. iOS users who want another virtual assistant aside from Siri can also get Google Assistant. Gummi Hafsteinsson, Google's product management director, hinted at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) this week that they are planning to deeply integrate the feature to iPhones. Hafsteinsson didn't exactly confirm the company's plans, but shared that they want the functionality to become "available to as many people as possible, AppleInsider reported. Google Assistant is already available -- albeit in a limited capacity -- in iOS devices via the Allo app. It's possible that the virtual assistant will be added to the iPhone's official Google app, but anything more than that will likely be blocked by Apple.

Gadget Hacks Android Hacks WonderHowTo Gadget Hacks Next Reality Invisiverse Driverless Null Byte Android Basics Glossary of Terms Galaxy S8 Rumors HTC 11 Rumors Everything Pixel Rooting Guide Gaming Roundups Forum Stay Secure How-Tos News How To: 10 Things Google Assistant Can Do to Make Your Life Easier By Dallas Thomas Yesterday 9:22 AM 10 Things Google Assistant Can Do to Make Your Life Easier By combining years of web search advancements, natural language processing, and even DeepMind's artificial intelligence, Google Assistant hopes to change the way you interact with your devices. If you're familiar with Google's previous services, Google Assistant is like Google Now, Voice Search, and Now on Tap rolled into one service, with an extra layer of personality added on top. The end result is one central location for all of your Google needs, be it web search, screen search, playing movies and music, or even booking a reservation at your favorite restaurant. How to Use Google Assistant Google Assistant works on a myriad of devices—it just depends on how you want to access the service. Google Home First up, if you'd like to interact with the Assistant using nothing but your voice, there's Google Home, a direct competitor to Amazon Echo, with a price of $129. It's a small device with two microphones and three speakers, so you can plug it in, place it on your coffee table, then ask Google Assistant any question by starting with the trigger phrase "OK Google." Google Home is Wi-Fi-enabled, so it can even interact with other connected devices like your Chromecast or Android TV, and smart home products such as Phillips Hue light bulbs or Nest thermostats. Order Google Home for $129 from the Google Store Android Devices For a second way to access Google Assistant, you'll soon be able to simply long-press the home button on any Android device running Marshmallow or higher. Once you do that, you can fire away with voice commands and dictate questions, and the Assistant will show results right on your screen. On top of that, this interface will even scan your screen to pick up on keywords you might be interested in (similar to Now on Tap) before you ask any questions. Previously, Google's own Pixel phones were the only devices with this functionality, but a software update rolling out right now is bringing Google Assistant to Android devices running Marshmallow or Nougat with Google Play Services. Google Allo Finally, Google Assistant can be accessed from any mobile device (even an iPhone!) by way of the Google Allo app. This is a messenger service at heart, but it's got a direct line to the Google Assistant. You simply start up a chat thread with @google in Allo, then interact with the Assistant as shown below. On top of that, Allo integrates the Google Assistant with your regular conversations, so it will even pop up with help and information when you're talking with friends. Install Google Allo for Android from the Google Play Store Install Google Allo for iPhone from the iOS App Store (1) Starting a conversation with Google Assistant in Allo. (2) Interacting with Google Assistant. (3) Google Assistant integrated into regular conversations. #1: Search Your Screen The first cool thing you can do with Google Assistant is search your phone's screen, and is exclusive to Android phones and tablets. To use this feature, simply long-press your home button when there's something on your screen that you'd like to learn more about. From here, swipe up on the Google Assistant page, and you'll see relevant info about the things on your screen. This is a perfect way to learn more about a movie, book a table at a restaurant, or quickly Google something that appears on your screen. (1) Triggering Google Assistant via home button long-press. (2) Swiping up to access the Screen Search results. (3) Google Assistant provides info about items on the screen. Images via Google #2: Answer Questions with Google's Knowledge Graph The main thing that makes Google Assistant so "smart" is Knowledge Graph, a feature that Google has been working on for years now. With traditional Google search, these are those results that provide details and answers instead of just a list of links. Example of a Google search Knowledge Graph (highlighted). Since Google Assistant is more voice-based rather than text-oriented, these Knowledge Graphs make the Assistant far more approachable. When you ask a question, Assistant will read this information aloud to actually answer your question—and in cases like Allo, even provide quick links for related searches like Twitter accounts. #3: Carry on a Conversation As well as Google Assistant answers one-off questions, it isn't until you start up a conversation with Assistant that it starts to show its natural language-processing strengths and contextual awareness. Don't Miss: Google Assistant's Fantastic Beasts Voice Commands Turn Your Phone into a Wand Let's say you're standing in front of that famous mirrored sculpture in Chicago, but you don't know its name off the top of your head. Just ask "What is this called," then Google Assistant will use your location as a context clue to realize what you're talking about, and instantly provide the answer—Cloud Gate. But then, if you press on a bit, Google Assistant becomes a bit more conversational. Follow up your first question with "Who made it," and Assistant will realize you're talking about Cloud Gate based on the fact that you just asked about the sculpture. These same principles apply to all of your dealings with Google Assistant, so it's a truly conversational experience. #4: Get a Daily Briefing of Your Schedule Google Assistant will ask for permission to access data from your Google account, and if you opt into this service, the Assistant becomes all the more powerful. It can then use various sources of information like appointments from your Google Calendar and upcoming events from Gmail to provide a daily briefing. When you wake up, just say "Good Morning," or "What do I have to do today," then the Assistant will give you a rundown of what's on your day's docket. Weather, meetings, reminders, and other events will be relayed, so you can start your day off on the right track. #5: Play Music With Google Home, the Google Assistant can serve as a central hub for all of your media. Just connect your supported music streaming account (Google Play Music, Spotify, Pandora, TuneIn, YouTube Music, or iHeartRadio) during initial setup, then say "OK Google, play <song/album/artist>" to fire up the tunes. Google Home turns Google Assistant into your own personal DJ. Image via Google #6: Cast Videos to Your TV Another great Google Home feature is its ability to connect to Google Cast-enabled devices like Chromecast or Android TV. If you have one of these connected to your local Wi-Fi network, just ask Google Assistant to "Play <movie/show/video> on my TV." The Google Home device will automatically connect to your Google Cast-enabled device to start playback on the big screen—and this same trick even works with music or photos! Don't Miss: Tell Google Assistant 'I'm Feeling Lucky' for a Fun Easter Egg #7: Find Your Photos Regardless of how you access the Google Assistant, it's a great way to view photos you've taken in the past. The only requirement for this one is that you've uploaded your pictures to Google Photos, which uses artificial intelligence to make all of your media searchable. Don't Miss: How to Upload Your Existing Pictures to Google Photos Just ask the Assistant to "Show me pictures I took in Colorado," for instance, then it will respond with a list of photos taken at that location. It can even find specific objects or people, so it's an easy way to find the right picture to share. (1) Google Assistant finding my pictures of Boulder, CO. (2) Assistant even recognizes my cat! #8: Make Dinner Reservations, Buy Movie Tickets & More Google Assistant is still new, and thanks to its DeepMind artificial intelligence backbone, it's still learning. Some of the first useful tasks Assistant was able to perform were making reservations at your favorite restaurant, and reserving tickets to a blockbuster movie. But now you can even hail a ride through Uber or order food directly from Google Assistant, and there's more features sure to come as other third-party partners jump on board. (1) Restaurant reservations. (2) Movie tickets and showtimes right in Google Assistant. #9: Get Directions With all of the cool places you're bound to learn about while using Google Assistant, it's nice that you can easily ask for directions. Many times, you'll see a Knowledge Graph card with a quick link for directions embedded right along with other info—just tap the Google Maps logo to get started. Otherwise, if you'd just like to know how to get somewhere, simply ask Assistant, then you'll get directions. (1) Google Assistant offering directions when asked about a restaurant. (2) Asking Google Assistant for directions. #10: Get the Latest News Delivered Daily Google Assistant is good with conversation, but you can still be curt with it. Just say or send words like "News," "Weather," or "Sports," then Assistant will give you a quick rundown of the latest information on that topic. From there, you can take things a step further by subscribing to this topic. After asking for information like "News," simply say "Send me daily," then select a time, and from now on, Google Assistant will give you a briefing on the topic every day. (1) Asking Google Assistant to send the news daily. (2) Google Assistant will now send news reports every night at 6 p.m. Don't Miss: 20 Google Home Easter Eggs & Fun Commands Follow Gadget Hacks on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and YouTube Follow Android Hacks on Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest Follow WonderHowTo on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Google+ Cover image via Google/YouTube; screenshots by Dallas Thomas/Gadget Hacks Related How To: Tell Google Assistant 'I'm Feeling Lucky' for a Fun Easter Egg News: Google Assistant Coming to Many More Android Devices How To: Make Google Assistant Control Almost Anything with IFTTT How To: Get the Pixel's Google Assistant Working on Other Android Devices How To: Google Actually Has 4 Different 'Assistants'—Here's the Best One for You How To: 18 Tips & Tricks to Help You Master Your Google Pixel News: Google's New Assistant Lets You Have Conversations with the Internet How To: 20 Google Home Easter Eggs & Fun Commands User Testimonials: Why People Are Switching from iPhone to Pixel How To: Get the Pixel's Navigation Buttons & Google Assistant Animation on Your Nexus How To: Get Rid of Google Assistant on Your Android Device & Switch Back to Google Now How To: Replicate the Moto X's "Active Listening" Hands-Free Assistant on Your Samsung Galaxy S3 News: The Pixel Exemplifies Google's New Hardware Philosophy—To Do It Right, Do It Yourself How To: Turn on Google Pixel's Wi-Fi Assistant to Get Secure Access on Open Networks How To: Use Google's Reverse Image Search on Your Android Device News: It's Official—The Made by Google Pixel Smartphones Are Here How To: Keep Siri Under Control on Your iPhone How To: DIY Tin Can Cookie Cutters from Recycled Tuna Fish Cans News: Pixel vs. iPhone 7 (You Might Just Have Buyer's Remorse) How To: 10 Life Hacks That'll Make Your Life Easier & Stress-Free News: This Guy Tested the Google Pixel XL Against the Nexus 6P (Camera Comparison, Google Assistant, & More) How To: Cortana for Android Has Leaked & Here's How to Install It (Update: It's Now on the Play Store) News: Amazing New Digital Assistant Puts Siri & Google Now to Shame How To: Make Siri More Powerful on Your iPhone by Adding These Extra Voice Commands Rumor Roundup: Andromeda, Pixel & More Coming at Google's Oct. 4 Announcement Circle Sunday: Anti-Theft Lunch Bags, London Riots Cleanup & Eureka Cancelled News: Google Assistant's Fantastic Beasts Voice Commands Turn Your Phone into a Wand News: 10 More Amazing Female Photographers to Follow on Google+ Beyond the Still: Chapter 2 Winner Winspiration: 10 Pieces of Hobo Advice to Inspire Your WTFoto Macro Challenge News: Sneak Nutrition Into Almost Any Food DEBUNKED: 3 Viral Google+ Myths News: FarmVille Orchards and Tree Mastery News: Google's Bradley Horowitz Discusses State of Google+ with Tim O'Reilly How To: The Official Google+ Insider's Guide Index News: Canning Mission Warning!

With that in mind, here we’ve round up the best Google Pixel and Pixel XL cases available. Instead of a Nexus this year Google released two Pixel Phones. One with a 5-inch display and the XL with a big 5.5-inch Quad-HD screen. It’s an all metal phone, but there’s also glass on the back which is one of many reasons a case is recommended. Read: Google Pixel Review: A New Type of Android Below we’ve round up a list of some of the best Pixel cases from brands we know, use and trust. Additionally, these cases come right from Google, are available on Amazon, or are from other trusted outlets. Everything from unique artwork, simple TPU cases, hand-made wood cases, wallets and much more. Google made a few cases of their own at release, which is a growing trend. The company is offering live cases, places cases and other custom options. Alternatively, Google also has some fun colorful choices or polycarbonate hard shell covers. There are plenty of options for owners. As many buyers know, since they’re not made by Samsung or Apple there aren’t as many choices for accessories. That said, Google partnered with big brands to offer good protection. Buyers do have more choices than previous Nexus phones though. More importantly, as more options are released we’ll update with our favorites after they’ve been tested and approved. In closing, your best bet is a case from the Google Store, Amazon, or from trusted brands. We’d recommend Spigen, Speck, Otterbox and others. We offer up great cases from all of those companies and more in our slideshow below. Check out these excellent cases and buy one today. Google Clear Case   1 / 20 First things first, getting a case from the phone maker themselves is typically the best route to take. And if you love the color of that really Blue Pixel or enjoy the two-tone back with the metal and glass design, you'll want a clear case. It doesn't look like much more than a standard TPU case, but it's actually made of a hard and durably polycarbonate plastic. Offering cutouts for all ports, buttons, sensors and more. This is a sleek and minimal way to protect the Pixel or XL. It's available now on the Google Store, but it's expensive.  Buy it from Google for $30   1 / 20 9 Responses 10/09/2016 Stacy Reply Anyone tried the DGtle Anti-Scratches Google Pixel Case?

Last week Google released E2EMail, "a Gmail client that exchanges OpenPGP mail." Google's documentation promises that "Any email sent from the app is also automatically signed and encrypted... The target is a simple user experience -- install app, approve permissions, start reading or send sending messages." Trailrunner7 quotes On The Wire: People have been trying to find a replacement for PGP almost since the day it was released, and with limited success. Encrypted email is still difficult to use and painful to implement in most cases, but Google has just released a Chrome plugin designed to address those problems. The new E2EMail extension doesn't turn a user's Gmail inbox into an encrypted mail client. Rather, it is a replacement that gives users a separate inbox for encrypted messages. The system is built on Google's end-to-end encryption library, and the company has released E2EMail as an open-source project. Wired quotes a web security researcher who calls the open sourcing "a telltale sign the project isn't going anywhere. This is a way for them to get their work out there but to absolve themselves of future obligations." But Google's privacy and security product manager responds that they're tackling some very thorny issues like secure key handling, and "The reason we want to put this into the open source community is precisely because everyone cares about this so much. We don't want everyone waiting for Google to get something done." gmail google internet ← Related Links → Free Software Foundation Challenges Tim Berners-Lee On DRM Google Announces 'End-To-End' Encryption Extension For Chrome What Gmail's New TLS Icon Really Means: Email Encryption Is Still Broken Gmail's Encryption Warning Spurs 25% Increase In Encrypted Inbound Emails Google, Unlike Microsoft, Must Turn Over Foreign Emails, Rules Judge Submission: Google Pushes Encrypted Email System Out Into the World Microsoft Finally Releases A Beta Version of Skype For Linux Google Open Sources Encrypted Email Extension For Chrome More | Reply Login Google Open Sources Encrypted Email Extension For Chrome Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

This can be seen in the fact that both models of the device are still hard to find, even months after launch. At this point, however, eager users might just be better off waiting until later this year, as Google has confirmed that the Pixel’s successor will debut in 2017. Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior VP of hardware, revealed this news in an interview with Android Pit this week, noting that “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it.” He continued with: “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” SlashGear’s Pixel XL Review While a follow-up to the Pixel was already a no-brainer, users may not want to hold out for the next version if they’re hoping it will be any more affordable. The cheapest model of the current Pixel starts at $650, with prices of the Pixel XL topping $800. When asked about the possibility of a budget-friendly version of the smartphone, Osterloh responded “the Pixel stays premium.” While Osterloh kept quiet on a release date, Google’s past releases have shown that a “Pixel 2” debut sometime in 2017’s fourth quarter is most likely. The original Pixel was launched in October of last year, and the same time period has been used to unveil older Nexus devices.

A pathologist’s report after reviewing a patient’s biological tissue samples is often the gold standard in the diagnosis of many diseases. For cancer in particular, a pathologist’s diagnosis has a profound impact on a patient’s therapy. The reviewing of pathology slides is a very complex task, requiring years of training to gain the expertise and experience to do well. Even with this extensive training, there can be substantial variability in the diagnoses given by different pathologists for the same patient, which can lead to misdiagnoses. For example, agreement in diagnosis for some forms of breast cancer can be as low as 48 per cent, and similarly low for prostate cancer. The lack of agreement is not surprising given the massive amount of information that must be reviewed in order to make an accurate diagnosis. Pathologists are responsible for reviewing all the biological tissues visible on a slide. However, there can be many slides per patient, each of which is 10+ gigapixels when digitized at 40X magnification. Imagine having to go through a thousand 10 megapixel (MP) photos, and having to be responsible for every pixel. Needless to say, this is a lot of data to cover, and often time is limited. To address these issues of limited time and diagnostic variability, Google is investigating how deep learning can be applied to digital pathology, by creating an automated detection algorithm that can naturally complement pathologists’ workflow. Google used images (graciously provided by the Radboud University Medical Center) which have also been used for the 2016 ISBI Camelyon Challenge1 to train algorithms that were optimized for localization of breast cancer that has spread (metastasized) to lymph nodes adjacent to the breast. The results? Standard “off-the-shelf” deep learning approaches like Inception (aka GoogLeNet) worked reasonably well for both tasks, although the tumour probability prediction heatmaps produced were a bit noisy. After additional customization, including training networks to examine the image at different magnifications (much like what a pathologist does), Google showed that it was possible to train a model that either matched or exceeded the performance of a pathologist who had unlimited time to examine the slides. In fact, the prediction heatmaps produced by the algorithm had improved so much that the localization score (FROC) for the algorithm reached 89 per cent, which significantly exceeded the score of 73 per cent for a pathologist with no time constraint2. Google is not the only ones to see promising results, as other groups were getting scores as high as 81 per cent with the same dataset. Even more exciting for us was that Google’s model generalized very well, even to images that were acquired from a different hospital using different scanners. For full details, see Google’s paper “Detecting Cancer Metastases on Gigapixel Pathology Images”. While these results are promising, there are a few important caveats to consider. Like most metrics, the FROC localization score is not perfect. Here, the FROC score is defined as the sensitivity (percentage of tumours detected) at a few pre-defined average false positives per slide. It is pretty rare for a pathologist to make a false positive call (mistaking normal cells as tumour). For example, the score of 73 per cent mentioned above corresponds to 73 per cent sensitivity and zero false positives. By contrast, Google’s algorithm’s sensitivity rises when more false positives are allowed. At 8 false positives per slide, Google’s algorithms had a sensitivity of 92 per cent. These algorithms perform well for the tasks for which they are trained, but lack the breadth of knowledge and experience of human pathologists — for example, being able to detect other abnormalities that the model has not been explicitly trained to classify (e.g. inflammatory process, autoimmune disease, or other types of cancer). To ensure the best clinical outcome for patients, these algorithms need to be incorporated in a way that complements the pathologist’s workflow. Google envisions that algorithm such as Google’s could improve the efficiency and consistency of pathologists. For example, pathologists could reduce their false negative rates (percentage of undetected tumours) by reviewing the top ranked predicted tumour regions including up to 8 false positive regions per slide. As another example, these algorithms could enable pathologists to easily and accurately measure tumour size, a factor that is associated with prognosis. Training models is just the first of many steps in translating interesting research to a real product. From clinical validation to regulatory approval, much of the journey from “bench to bedside” still lies ahead — but Google is off to a very promising start, and Google hopes by sharing their work, they will be able to accelerate progress in this space.

The two Tech giants, who have been accused of a “liberal bias”, will set up the “coalition news verification project” with 37 French and international media outlets including the BBC, AFP (Agence France-Presse), and BuzzFeed News. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER On an official blog post, Google claimed “CrowdTangle” had been set up “with a goal of helping the French electorate make sense of what and who to trust in their social media feeds, web searches and general online news consumption in the coming months…” The first round of the French presidential election is due to be held in April, and polls suggest right wing populist Marine Le Pen could come out on top. The participating media outlets (Credit: Google/News Lab) Following the January election of Donald J. Trump as U.S. president – another right wing populist challenging the establishment – many liberal media outlets claimed voters had been tricked by so-called “fake news” and the result could be discredited. “With combined expertise from across media and technology, CrossCheck aims to ensure hoaxes, rumours and false claims are swiftly debunked, and misleading or confusing stories are accurately reported,” Google said. “With the French presidential election approaching, journalists from across France and beyond will work together to find and verify content circulating publicly online, whether it is photographs, videos, memes, comment threads and news sites.” The public will be encouraged to submit questions and links to news and social media content they wish to see investigated. The questions will then be listed alongside answers on the CrossCheck website, Google explained via its News Lab arm. “Each participating newsroom will contribute their own experience, resources and regional knowledge to speed and strengthen the verification process, and to ensure that accurate reports reach citizens across the country and beyond,” the website adds. In August 2016, Facebook fired its entire Trending News team, formerly responsible for curating the platform’s “Trending News” list, after Breitbart News and others reported accusations of progressive, liberal biases. At the beginning of this year, Facebook launched their own features in Germany to counter fake news after authorities had claimed such stories could help populists in this year’s elections and threatened to sue unless unfavourable content was deleted quickly. The social media site has been working with the European Union (EU) since December 2016 to censor “hate speech”, as well as help authorities “criminalise” “individual perpetrators” and “promot[e] independent counter-narratives” that the EU favours. National governments are also interested in influencing online content. German officials have proposed creating a special government unit to combat fake news and the UK parliament is set to launch an inquiry this year, claiming the phenomenon is undermining democracy. After the U.S. election, the left wing website Buzzfeed claimed that, overall, fake news accounted for 10.6 million of the 21.5 million shares, reactions, and comments on U.S. political stories on Facebook last year. However, President Donald. J. Trump accused Buzzfeed of being “fake news” after the website published lurid and unsubstantiated claims about the then president-elect. Despite publishing allegedly fake news, BuzzFeed is part of the CrossCheck project with Google and Facebook.

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Perspective is still in early days of development, but in the future, you may have to adjust your speech in order to satisfy the lofty standards of Google. Otherwise, the company’s faceless AI might just have to “improve” you. Where’s Sarah Connor when you need her? The good news is that, for now at least, Perspective is about as effective as C-3PO with a lisp. Software engineer and columnist David Auerbach has found the program woefully inept at sorting “toxic” comments from ordinary ones. Because the AI currently focuses on words rather than meanings, inoffensive comments like, “Rape is a horrible crime,” or, “few Muslims are a terrorist threat,” were assigned “toxicity” ratings of over 75 percent. Of course, even if Perspective could successfully sort “toxic” comments from innocuous ones, that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to be deleted or buried. According to the project’s homepage, the system performs no function other than detection. But statements from the project’s developers make it clear that censorship is the end goal. Indeed, the system seems to have been developed to augment the left’s ongoing war on comments sections. The software was initially made available just to organizations that are part of Google’s Digital News Initiative, including the BBC, The Financial Times, and The Guardian, which promptly began testing the software to moderate their comments sections. “News organizations want to encourage engagement and discussion around their content, but find that sorting through millions of comments to find those that are trolling or abusive takes a lot of money, labour and time,” says Jared Cohen, president of Jigsaw, the Google social incubator that built the tool. “As a result, many sites have shut down comments altogether. But they tell us that isn’t the solution they want.” Google couldn’t be clearer: it’s a censorship bot. And just because it’s currently limited to news sites and comments sections doesn’t mean it won’t be rolled out to social networks and the rest of the web. Twitter, which just introduced yet another system to punish users who hurt celebrities’ feelings, would probably love to get their hands on a working version of Perspective. Twitter already has a tremendous depth of data on its users, including gender, location, and personal interests. Imagine that data, combined with an AI tool designed to pinpoint inconvenient content, in the hands of a CEO who has done little to conceal his political biases. The idea of an all-powerful Google robot watching over us all, making sure our speech is “improved,” has greatly excited mainstream media. Google, says the BBC, is going to “make talk less toxic.” According to WIRED, Perspective will put a stop to “abusive comments that silence vulnerable voices.” New York magazine portrays Perspsective as a friendly a robot, “a kind of Clippy for the comments section.” Our robot overlords are certainly getting a warm welcome The left are likely to be disappointed though. If Auerbach’s early research on Perspective is any guide, the system is designed to filter out impoliteness, not political disagreement. Google’s censorbot might turn the comments section – and perhaps the web – into a grey, sanitized dystopia scrubbed of strong emotions and trollish humor, but it won’t get rid of facts. In other words, myths about gender wage gaps, police racism, and “moderate” Islam are still going to get debunked. Even Skynet can’t keep some things quiet.

US tech giant Google will release a new Pixel smartphone later this year. The device, with the built-in personal Google Assistant, will directly competes with the Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. "The device will remain 'premium' in its next iteration and the company is not interested in offering a low-cost version, preferring instead to let that segment be addressed by its external hardware partners," techcrunch.com quoted Rick Osterloh, Google SVP of Hardware as saying. Launched last year, Pixel is the first smartphone that works as an intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator. The 5-inch smartphone is equipped with Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM and runs on Android Nougat 7.0 operating system. The device also has Pixel Imprint -- a fingerprint scanner on the back of the smartphone for quick access to all apps, texts and e-mails.

A small investigation Women in baseball: A league of their own and so much more Riffed from the Headlines 04/03/2017 Full Episode Ninety per cent of the world's coral reefs are expected to be killed off over the next three decades, but as Richard Vevers tells Day 6 host Brent Bambury, communication and underwater photography could help reverse that trend. "We will have a record and we can monitor change over time. Something that was previously very difficult to do at scale," says Vevers, who is the founder and CEO of a non-profit group The Ocean Agency. Richard Vevers says some of their early work near Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef is some of the most viewed underwater imagery of all-time. (Richard Vevers / Catlin Seaview Survey) He and his team have developed what amounts to a version of Google Street View for the ocean. Vevers says their images will provide documentation that can be used for science and to raise awareness for the cause. Vevers spent ten years in advertising but after a bad meeting, he gave it up to become an underwater photographer. The Ocean Agency's photos have generated millions of views online. "That gets me excited in terms of the potential for this kind of imagery, to engage people with issues that very few are aware of," Vevers says. The Ocean Agency documenting underwater life around the Caribbean. (The Ocean Agency)     How they do it Google Street View is a technology featured in Google Maps and Google Earth. It provides panoramic views from positions along many streets in the world. Vevers says his project isn't so different, except he uses a camera connected to a military-grade, underwater scooter to capture his environment instead of a camera mounted on the roof of a car. In 2013, The Ocean Agency project went global with stops in the Caribbean Galapagos, Monaco and numerous other locations. (The Ocean Agency / XL Catlin Seaview Survey / Richard Vevers) Vevers says the self-propelled scuba scooter takes some of the burden off the diver in moving along, and they cover two kilometres worth of photography per dive. "The ocean in a very big place, but we are able to get a really good representation of so many different environments in so many different countries using this technology," he says. And just like Google cars follow roads, Ocean Agency photographers follow patterns created by the coral reefs, recording images every three seconds as they go along. "Most people don't dive and never will. What I wanted to do with the camera we invented is to allow people to have the experience of jumping into the water, and be able to explore an environment like a coral reef, which to me is the most magical place on the planet," he says.     One of The Ocean Agency's main goals is to monitor the reefs for scientific purposes, and the images and technology have the power to draw attention to the issues oceans face. That's how they pitched the idea to Google. "We showed them the kind of imagery that we would be able to get," he says. "Instantly, they were big fans of the project and wanted to make it happen." The underwater images are available to view on Google Earth.   Creating awareness Vevers says reefs may be small in size compared to the rest of the ocean, but they're hugely important to the ocean as a whole. "Coral reefs support about 500,000,000 people worldwide as a main source of protein and income. They also support about 25 per cent of all marine species." In late 2016, scientists surveying the Great Barrier Reef said it had suffered the worst coral die-off ever recorded after being bathed in warm waters that bleached and then weakened the coral. That's just one example. Bleaching is happening to reefs across the world. Coral bleaching is a process in which coral colonies lose their colour, which happens when the water is too warm for the microscopic algae living in the organisms. A side-by-side virtual dive of the same coral reef in Hawaii - before and after coral bleaching. After the last two and a half years of documenting what has become the biggest coral die-off ever recorded, Vevers and his partners launched  50 Reefs. The program aims to save what's left of the world's 50 most important coral reefs. "We saw this happening on a massive scale and wanted to do something about it. We realized there wasn't a global plan to address this issue," he says. "I didn't realize how advanced it was until I started working on the project. Now you realize we've only got a very small window of opportunity to save coral reefs." Richard Vevers with the SVII camera. The device attached to the camera pulls him along. (The Ocean Agency / XL Catlin Seaview Survey )      Saving the 10% The latest report from the IPCC says that if temperatures increase beyond 1.5 degrees centigrade, approximately 90 per cent of coral will be lost. "We need to find the reefs that we can save," says Vevers, referring to the remaining ten per cent. His photography will help locate the reefs that are least vulnerable to climate change, helping scientists narrow their efforts and resources to the reefs that have the best chance of survival. "We can also work out which part of the reefs are best at re-seeding other parts of the reefs," he says.

(The Ocean Agency / XL Catlin Seaview Survey / Richard Vevers) Coral fluorescing as part of the bleaching process in New Caledonia in March 2016. (The Ocean Agency / XL Catlin Seaview Survey / Richard Vevers) For survival, location matters. In the 1980s, The Galapagos Islands lost lost 97 percent of its coral in the first of what is now three major bleaching events. The Galapagos is considered extremely vulnerable, whereas reefs near Indonesia remain healthy. "Even at the height of the big, global bleaching event, it was in pristine condition with amazing coral cover and amazing fish life," Vevers says. The Ocean Agency filming bleached coral off the coast of American Somoa. (The Ocean Agency) Getting the word out While Vevers left advertising in his wake, he says the skills he gained have been instrumental in pulling 50 Reefs together. "Communication is hugely important. Often, a lot of great science gets hidden in papers read by scientists rather than getting out to the media." he says.   "What we wanted to do, right at the start of this project, is balance communication with the science. And get that balance right to make sure this news is front page news. And we've had a lot of success over the last few years."

Even before his moving van is unpacked, Bobby introduces himself. He’s friendly and good-humored, and he says you should come over for a barbecue sometime. But there’s something “off” about him, so you decide to find out more — his career, his past, anything suspicious. But short of hiring a private investigator, what can you find out? A lot, actually. You’d be amazed how much public information is tangled up in the web. No matter how hard we may try to disguise our past, much of our lives has been digitized and archived, just waiting to be discovered. This is a double-edged sword, of course. If you want to find information on others, that process has never been more streamlined. But it might be just as easy for others to investigate you. It’s a great idea to look yourself up and erase what you don’t want to be readily accessible. Click here to learn how to remove your personal information from the most popular people-search sites. So what can you learn about someone? Here’s how to get the dirt on Bobby, for free. Start with Google Google is the easiest place to begin your search. Just enter the person’s full name in quotations marks, in this case, “Bobby Smith.” There are plenty of Bobby Smiths out there, so you’ll want to narrow your search using other information, such as what city he lives in. If he just moved to your neighborhood from Cincinnati, you’ll want to include that city instead of your own. If Bobby likes to make friends, a bunch of social media sites may pop up: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest and scores of others. Many people make their social media profiles invisible to non-friends. To see Bobby’s details, you may have to send him a connection request. Remember, though, that many people don’t use their real names online. If you find Bobby’s online alias (Smirk Bob, perhaps), you may find that Bobby uses the same screen name for his other social media accounts. Finally, run a Google image search to locate pictures of Bobby. You might find out that he’s a champion swimmer. You might also find out that he was arrested for a DUI. A one-stop shop for information Next, try PeekYou. Instead of locking in on keywords, PeekYou looks for links that are likely associated with the people you’re investigating. When it finds information, PeekYou indexes all the links in one place for easy browsing. You can quickly see an overview of just about anyone. You can also search by categories, such as interests, work, school, city, phone, and email. You’ll be surprised by what you find. Click here to scour more than 60 sites ranging from social media to news outlets. Check out your neighbors So what happens if Bobby doesn’t introduce himself, and you have no idea what his name is? There’s a website where you can enter your address, pull up a map of your block and click on houses to see publicly available information about the people living around you. Instead of rooting through his mailbox, which is illegal, click here for an online phone book that uses modern social-networking technology. Find out where photos were taken If you’ve never heard of The Beat, prepare to be amazed. As you may know, lots of digital photos are embedded with metadata, including where the photo was taken. The Beat combines those “geotags” with Google Street View, so you can see what publicly posted photos were shot in your neighborhood. The internet doesn’t get more vivid than this: an album of images taken on your block by people you may never have met. Adding to the anxiety are the privacy issues that The Beat raises. So be careful about the photos you post, especially if you’ve used geotags to indicate where they were snapped. Click here to see photos taken in your neighborhood. Check the sex offender registry The bottom line is this: You want to make sure Bobby isn’t a threat, and one of the most frightening threats is a convicted sex offender. With the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website, all you have to do is enter a ZIP code and run a search to see a list of convicted offenders in your area. You see pictures of the sex offenders and their home and work addresses. In some cases, you’ll also see a risk level. Click here to check if a sex offender lives in your area.

While this shouldn’t really surprise anyone, the news is reassuring and will allow for some exciting rumors in the coming months. For months on end leaks and rumors have been talking about the Galaxy S8, but that isn’t the only important phone coming in 2017. This will be a big year for Google, and a successor to the Pixel and Pixel XL should have many buyers excited. Read: Google Pixel XL Review In fact, a few loose rumors have been floating around regarding what to expect from the Pixel 2. That’s it though, nothing but rumors. Stating it will have an even better camera, faster processor and even a budget model is in the works. Today though, something different is being said. Last year the first phone “designed by Google, inside and out” was released. Made by HTC but sold exclusively as a Google phone on Verizon and unlocked. It was arguably one of the best smartphones of 2016. This year though, something even better is in the works. According to Google VP of hardware Rick Osterloh, a new Google Pixel 2 is coming in 2017. The lineup of smartphones will remain “premium” meaning users can expect a high-price tag and a top-tier device. This information was shared with AndroidPit. He went on to further by talking about the current generation device, and the lack of availability. For those unaware, the Google Pixel XL is a popular phone but out of stock almost everywhere. Those who want one can’t get it, until more inventory arrives. This has been a problem for Google in the past with Nexus devices, and continued with the Pixel series. It’s worth noting that after multiple questions Google’s VP of hardware made sure to mention that there will not be a cheap Pixel this year. Early rumors suggested another high-end phone, and then a more wallet-friendly $399-$449 device for those in the budget market. Apparently Google has no plans to enter the competitive budget segment being dominated by OnePlus and Huawei. As of right now we have no concrete details regarding what to expect, but one can speculate. Most likely Google’s next phone will be water-resistant, have a bigger screen, and potentially small bezels like the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. We can also assume it will have a better camera, faster processor, more RAM, and again come with 128GB of storage with no micro-SD slot. Google Pixel 2 Release Date So when will Google’s new Pixel 2 be released? With a Galaxy S8 and new iPhone’s coming, this will be an important question. However, it’s important to remember that Google almost always releases smartphones around the same time every year. That being near the end. The Pixel was released in October, and before that the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P were announced in October also. When asked about a Google Pixel 2 release date, Rick Osterloh had this to say: “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it.” Meaning we can expect a new phone from Google sometime near the end of the year. Likely in September to compete with Samsung or Apple, or in October like always. There aren’t too many details right now. Just know that another high-end premium phone is coming from Google in 2017. Stay tuned for more details. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

When the first Google Pixel hit the internet for purchase, many Nexus users had sticker shock and many refused to buy it. The Google Pixel 2 has now been confirmed to be releasing sometime in 2017 with no confirmation if it will be October as the previous device was. Rick Osterloh, SVP of Hardware at Google and thus the big boss for the Pixel project, confirmed with Android Pit that the Google Pixel 2 will indeed surface this year. Osterloh said, “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it.” He then follows up more concretely by saying, “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” This also makes it clear that the Pixel was by no means a one-off experiment, but that it will remain a fixed quantity in the smartphone world. He also confirmed that the Pixel will be at home in the upper price segment. “Pixel stays premium,” explains the hardware boss of Google. Also, he stuck to his answer through repeated questioning by various round table participants: there will be no cheap Pixel. Google will continue to leave lower price segments to other manufacturers. There has been some hope that perhaps Google would introduce a lower-priced Pixel phone more akin to Nexus devices in terms of price. From Osterloh’s comments above, it doesn’t look like Google wants to play any part in the lower-end of the Android device world. For many that will be disappointing news as they have felt that their Nexus devices were solid performers that were already premium. When do you think the new Pixel will be announced? Do you think Google should release a lower-priced Pixel?

Chat app Line is developing an AI assistant and Amazon Echo-style smart speaker Posted Mar 2, 2017 by Jon Russell (@jonrussell) 0 SHARES Next Story Octane AI boldly bets that Convos are the future of content Messaging app Line is taking a leaf out of the books of Amazon, Google and others after it launched its own artificial intelligence platform. A voice-powered concierge service called Clova — short for “Cloud Virtual Assistant” — is the centerpiece of the service, much like Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana and Google Assistant. Beyond the assistant living inside the main Line chat app, the company said it has plans to release hardware with support for Clova baked-in, as Amazon and Google have done, and work with third parties to integrate the service into additional hardware. Sony and toy maker Tomy are among the early partners it is talking to. Also, interestingly, Line has acquired a majority stake in the Japanese company behind a ‘holographic’ AI service. Vinclu is the startup, and its Gatebox is its ‘virtual robot’ that gives AI a graphical presence in the form of manga cartoon-style female — very Japanese. “Gatebox’s holographic home assistant is voice activated and uses a variety of sensors to interact with the device’s operator in a realistic and natural manner, while also connecting to a range of devices in the home,” Line said. As this promotional video shows, Gatebox is painted more like a virtual companion than a gender-neutral AI assistant. That might require a different approach if the product is to ship outside of Japan, perhaps involving Brown the bear and others who star in Line’s sticker packs. There’s no word on what Line plans to do specifically with Gatebox, but the chat app firm did say that it will introduce Clova to the Line app and begin selling a Clova-powered smart speaker in Japan and Korea in “early summer.” The first iteration of Clova will allow the kind of things other AI apps already do, such as getting news, weather info, playing music, etc. Initially the firm is developing Clova-related services itself — alongside parent firm Naver — but Line said it plans to open the AI platform for both software and hardware up to third parties in the future. That’s where tasks could get more complicated and intricate. “The goal is to create a thriving ecosystem of contents, services and devices with a wide range of partners, allowing the Clova platform to continue to expand and develop over time,” Line said in a statement. The company’s foray into AI seems fairly standard compared to what those leading the space are doing, but Line is the first chat app company to make a sustained push. While an AI might help increase engagement with existing users, it doesn’t seem like a bridge to bring new users into the fold and that is among the key issues Line is currently grappling with. The company, which went public in a dual U.S.-Japan IPO worth $1.1 billion last year, recently posted its largest revenue drop amid slowing user growth, putting it under pressure to generate new revenue streams. In an interview with Bloomberg, CEO Takeshi Idezawa admitted that the AI strategy — which will include more M&A deals — would not immediately address those concerns. “It’s one of the longer-term bets. The point is to secure a position early on. People will probably begin to use these services more regularly three to five years from now,” he said. In the nearer term, Line is focusing on adding advertising to its monetization mix, which is primarily composed of in-app purchases for games and sticker pack sales. One of its other bets has been doubling down on different areas of social. The firm recently increased its stake in Snapchat-like service Snow — also owned by Naver — to close to 50 percent, while it has long pledged to be more than just a chat app. Related services it currently offers include mobile payments, music streaming, taxis on-demand and more. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase LINE Corporation Founded 2000 Overview LINE Corporation develops calling and messaging applications for mobile phones in Japan and internationally.

Google announced this week a new live TV service called YouTube TV. Critics are panning YouTube TV as lackluster and overpriced. But I think it's going to change everything. Google says YouTube TV will be rolled out "soon" and gradually, starting in major markets and later expanding to other cities. (Sorry, world. YouTube TV is U.S. only.) [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Google did not specify which cities or when rollouts would occur, but it hardly matters. U.S. residents can sign up immediately even if they live outside one of the designated cities. Simply choose one of the markets where YouTube TV is available. Local programming will be from that market, not yours. A superficial glance at YouTube TV could make you shrug with indifference. It costs $35 per month for a family plan of six accounts and is set to begin broadcasting 40 channels starting in a few months. These channels include ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, the CW, ESPN, USA, Bravo, E, MSNBC, Fox News, Disney Channel, FX and local stations. (Members can also add Showtime or Fox Soccer Plus for an additional, yet-unannounced extra fee.) Conspicuously absent are: CNN, HBO, AMC, MTV, VH1, ET, Comedy Central, Discovery, Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, TNT, PBS, TBS or The Food Network. YouTube TV will play on dedicated iOS and Android smartphone and tablet apps and on the tv.youtube.com web site. It can also be streamed to full-fledged TVs with Google’s $35 Chromecast dongle, or TVs with Chromecast support built-in. Later this year, YouTube TV will be supported by unspecified TVs, "TV-streaming devices" and gaming consoles, according to Google. As a bonus, YouTube TV comes with content from YouTube Red, the ad-free subscription service, and Google Play Music. YouTube TV will not require a contract or commitment and can be canceled without a fee. It can also be paused and will even pause automatically if nobody logs into it for three months from their home zip code. So you're paying $35 per month, but you can pause it for, say, six months and not pay for those months, then resume it later. If you or your family members don't log in from your home zip code for three months, YouTube TV will stop charging your credit card until you re-activate it. Why YouTube TV is better than cable YouTube TV seems like it's half as good as a cable subscription. It's roughly half the cost, and you get roughly half the stations and half the commercials as with the most basic cable subscription. But that comparison obscures cable's flaws and YouTube TV's strengths. In the old days, cord cutting meant giving up on legal, high-quality access to some of your favorite cable TV shows. Lately, however -- thanks to internet-based TV services like DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue, Sling TV and now YouTube TV -- you can get most of the shows online that used to require a cable subscription. Streaming services like Netflix, Roku, Hulu, HBO Go and Amazon Fire TV have become a little cheaper and a lot better. These companies are making improvements the old-fashioned way -- through better technology. One example is Netflix, which announced this week its intention to use artificial intelligence (A.I.) to encode video on a scene-by-scene basis in a way that improves video quality on a smartphone -- or, more to the point, enables Neftlix to selectively reduce video quality (and bandwidth usage) in ways that aren't noticeable to viewers. (The new technology will roll out within five months, according to Netflix.) The bottom line is that cable has lost its monopoly on high-quality TV shows. As a result, the majority of the value of cable is live "event television." For certain major shows, most of the enjoyment is derived from watching the show live. Even now, it's hard or impossible for most cord cutters to watch live, high-quality, user-friendly event TV like the Oscars, TV series or season finales (such as last year's season finale of Game of Thrones), political debates, breaking news and just about any major sports event. Event TV has become a social media phenomenon. It's fun to tweet and post about event TV while it's happening. If you show up for work the next day, everybody's going to be talking about the show you missed; you'll end up with an earful of spoilers and a bad case of feeling left out. Sports are a special problem, because games and matches happen so often. Every game your team plays is "event television" if you're a fan. Depending on the sport, it's possible nowadays for cord cutters to watch some games live. The streaming services offer ESPN and Fox Sports channels, and some offer American football channels. You can also pay to get streaming games for baseball, basketball, hockey and soccer. But the options for cord cutters are often inadequate for sports fans, especially for college sports and less mainstream sports. Sure, you can always buy rabbit ears and connect to terrestrial TV for local channels. Some cord cutters selectively "borrow" broadcast programming from a friend or relative with a cable subscription. But these aren't appealing solutions for most viewers. YouTube TV offers nearly all event television, including sports. The mainstream network stations offered by YouTube will give you the Oscars, major political and breaking news events, the Olympics and others. It also offers generous sports programming, and even good coverage of college sports. YouTube TV includes not only ESPN, but also ESPN2, ESPNU, the Big Ten Network, SEC Network, CBS Sports Network, NBCSN, FS1, Fox Sports Networks and Comcast SportsNet. So while YouTube TV offers only half the "channels" of basic cable, they offer most of the "value" for most of the viewers. YouTube TV has other big advantages over cable, including Google Home support and better recommendations about what to watch, according to the Google announcement. Google is great at algorithmic recommendations and search. Each family membership allows the playing of up to three shows at once on different devices -- and recording to six cloud DVR accounts, each with unlimited capacity (Recordings will be available for nine months). Unlimited storage plays into a strength Google has used to clobber the competition in other spheres, including photo storage on Google Photos. "Cloud DVR" is "transformational for our business," Sling TV CEO Roger Lynch said recently. That company offers cloud DVR, but with a cap of 100 hours of recording, and users cannot record shows from ABC, Disney and ESPN networks. Why YouTube TV means the end of cable Google is in a far better position than any TV or streaming video provider to monetize live TV. Google can command higher ad prices because it has far better data on users than cable TV companies do. Advertising companies have been looking forward to YouTube live TV for years because YouTube is expected to have both the industry's best targeting and measurement for ads, and also the largest market of young viewers. With limited ad budgets and with YouTube demanding premium fees, Google is likely to pull budgets away from other providers, especially cable providers. Trends in TV viewership favor Google. People over the age of 30 think of TV as involving living rooms, giant TVs and cable subscriptions. But younger viewers favor YouTube and smartphones. (A recent Piper Jaffray survey found that 26% of American teenagers watch YouTube every day.) So what happens when young viewers get older? As young people age, they'll gradually prefer more conventional TV programming over the zany, hyperactive antics of YouTube stars. With YouTube TV they'll be able to find that programming on their favorite medium -- YouTube on smartphones. You can imagine a freshman going off to college. YouTube TV would be a slam dunk. A family plan would enable parents to pay for the student's TV content, as well as one account for each parent and each younger sibling, all for the same $35 per month. Even before YouTube TV hits, YouTube itself is by all accounts a runaway success. YouTube said last month that its users watch more than a billion hours of video each day. Viewership is 10 times higher than it was just five years ago. Advertising on YouTube earned Google $3 billion in revenue last year. But YouTube TV should make YouTube even better. YouTube Red Originals are shows developed by YouTube stars and also by more traditional TV content creators. The introduction of YouTube TV and the inclusion of YouTube Red in the package is likely to increase audience and incentive for more and better original exclusive YouTube content. It may be only a matter of time before YouTube introduces runaway hits with the quality and scale of House of Cards or Game of Thrones. YouTube TV is a nightmare for cable TV companies, which are already bleeding customers. Cable providers lost 1.7 million paid U.S. subscribers last year, according to MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett. YouTube TV offers flexible options, event TV, mobility and the familiarity of YouTube. For advertisers, YouTube TV provides a big incentive to move ad spending from cable providers to YouTube. Cable TV is doomed. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Note to self: Stop taking notes! How YouTube TV will kill cable Show More Don’t look now, but cable TV’s days are numbered. Google announced this week a new live TV service called YouTube TV. Critics are panning YouTube TV as lackluster and overpriced. But I think it's going to change everything. Google says YouTube TV will be rolled out "soon" and gradually, starting in major markets and later expanding to other cities. (Sorry, world. YouTube TV is U.S. only.) [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Google did not specify which cities or when rollouts would occur, but it hardly matters. U.S. residents can sign up immediately even if they live outside one of the designated cities. Simply choose one of the markets where YouTube TV is available. Local programming will be from that market, not yours. A superficial glance at YouTube TV could make you shrug with indifference. It costs $35 per month for a family plan of six accounts and is set to begin broadcasting 40 channels starting in a few months. These channels include ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, the CW, ESPN, USA, Bravo, E, MSNBC, Fox News, Disney Channel, FX and local stations. (Members can also add Showtime or Fox Soccer Plus for an additional, yet-unannounced extra fee.) Conspicuously absent are: CNN, HBO, AMC, MTV, VH1, ET, Comedy Central, Discovery, Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, TNT, PBS, TBS or The Food Network. YouTube TV will play on dedicated iOS and Android smartphone and tablet apps and on the tv.youtube.com web site. It can also be streamed to full-fledged TVs with Google’s $35 Chromecast dongle, or TVs with Chromecast support built-in. Later this year, YouTube TV will be supported by unspecified TVs, "TV-streaming devices" and gaming consoles, according to Google. As a bonus, YouTube TV comes with content from YouTube Red, the ad-free subscription service, and Google Play Music. YouTube TV will not require a contract or commitment and can be canceled without a fee. It can also be paused and will even pause automatically if nobody logs into it for three months from their home zip code. So you're paying $35 per month, but you can pause it for, say, six months and not pay for those months, then resume it later. If you or your family members don't log in from your home zip code for three months, YouTube TV will stop charging your credit card until you re-activate it. Why YouTube TV is better than cable YouTube TV seems like it's half as good as a cable subscription. It's roughly half the cost, and you get roughly half the stations and half the commercials as with the most basic cable subscription. But that comparison obscures cable's flaws and YouTube TV's strengths. In the old days, cord cutting meant giving up on legal, high-quality access to some of your favorite cable TV shows. Lately, however -- thanks to internet-based TV services like DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue, Sling TV and now YouTube TV -- you can get most of the shows online that used to require a cable subscription. Streaming services like Netflix, Roku, Hulu, HBO Go and Amazon Fire TV have become a little cheaper and a lot better. These companies are making improvements the old-fashioned way -- through better technology. One example is Netflix, which announced this week its intention to use artificial intelligence (A.I.) to encode video on a scene-by-scene basis in a way that improves video quality on a smartphone -- or, more to the point, enables Neftlix to selectively reduce video quality (and bandwidth usage) in ways that aren't noticeable to viewers. (The new technology will roll out within five months, according to Netflix.) The bottom line is that cable has lost its monopoly on high-quality TV shows. As a result, the majority of the value of cable is live "event television." For certain major shows, most of the enjoyment is derived from watching the show live. Even now, it's hard or impossible for most cord cutters to watch live, high-quality, user-friendly event TV like the Oscars, TV series or season finales (such as last year's season finale of Game of Thrones), political debates, breaking news and just about any major sports event. Event TV has become a social media phenomenon. It's fun to tweet and post about event TV while it's happening. If you show up for work the next day, everybody's going to be talking about the show you missed; you'll end up with an earful of spoilers and a bad case of feeling left out. Sports are a special problem, because games and matches happen so often. Every game your team plays is "event television" if you're a fan. Depending on the sport, it's possible nowadays for cord cutters to watch some games live. The streaming services offer ESPN and Fox Sports channels, and some offer American football channels. You can also pay to get streaming games for baseball, basketball, hockey and soccer. But the options for cord cutters are often inadequate for sports fans, especially for college sports and less mainstream sports. Sure, you can always buy rabbit ears and connect to terrestrial TV for local channels. Some cord cutters selectively "borrow" broadcast programming from a friend or relative with a cable subscription. But these aren't appealing solutions for most viewers. YouTube TV offers nearly all event television, including sports. The mainstream network stations offered by YouTube will give you the Oscars, major political and breaking news events, the Olympics and others. It also offers generous sports programming, and even good coverage of college sports. YouTube TV includes not only ESPN, but also ESPN2, ESPNU, the Big Ten Network, SEC Network, CBS Sports Network, NBCSN, FS1, Fox Sports Networks and Comcast SportsNet. So while YouTube TV offers only half the "channels" of basic cable, they offer most of the "value" for most of the viewers. YouTube TV has other big advantages over cable, including Google Home support and better recommendations about what to watch, according to the Google announcement. Google is great at algorithmic recommendations and search. Each family membership allows the playing of up to three shows at once on different devices -- and recording to six cloud DVR accounts, each with unlimited capacity (Recordings will be available for nine months). Unlimited storage plays into a strength Google has used to clobber the competition in other spheres, including photo storage on Google Photos. "Cloud DVR" is "transformational for our business," Sling TV CEO Roger Lynch said recently. That company offers cloud DVR, but with a cap of 100 hours of recording, and users cannot record shows from ABC, Disney and ESPN networks. Why YouTube TV means the end of cable Google is in a far better position than any TV or streaming video provider to monetize live TV. Google can command higher ad prices because it has far better data on users than cable TV companies do. Advertising companies have been looking forward to YouTube live TV for years because YouTube is expected to have both the industry's best targeting and measurement for ads, and also the largest market of young viewers. With limited ad budgets and with YouTube demanding premium fees, Google is likely to pull budgets away from other providers, especially cable providers. Trends in TV viewership favor Google. People over the age of 30 think of TV as involving living rooms, giant TVs and cable subscriptions. But younger viewers favor YouTube and smartphones. (A recent Piper Jaffray survey found that 26% of American teenagers watch YouTube every day.) So what happens when young viewers get older? As young people age, they'll gradually prefer more conventional TV programming over the zany, hyperactive antics of YouTube stars. With YouTube TV they'll be able to find that programming on their favorite medium -- YouTube on smartphones. You can imagine a freshman going off to college. YouTube TV would be a slam dunk. A family plan would enable parents to pay for the student's TV content, as well as one account for each parent and each younger sibling, all for the same $35 per month. Even before YouTube TV hits, YouTube itself is by all accounts a runaway success. YouTube said last month that its users watch more than a billion hours of video each day.

At the Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona, Google’s Product Management Director Gummi Hafsteinsson hinted that Google Assistant might also be launched across iPhones. Hafsteinsson revealed at MWC that Google Assistant will now be available on Android TV, Android Wear 2.0 and Android Auto. I don’t think we have anything to announce at this point, but I think the general philosophy is that we would like to have the Assistant available to as many people as possible. While the search engine giant made a prominent move in introducing the Google Assistant to other, earlier unsupported, Android smartphones, the inclusion of iPhone in the list will be welcomed.   Though Siri is the iPhone’s original assistant, the Google Assistant will be available on iPhones through Google’s iOS apps. However, you can still technically get the Google Assistant on iPhones via the Google Allo app. Rumors suggest that Apple may introduce an upgrade for Siri at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, allowing more AI features and capabilities for the already heavily used virtual assistant. With Google Assistant on iPhones, it will be interesting to see who garners more popularity amongst iOS users. likethis What's your reaction?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals General  ⋮  Mobile These Renders Of Google’s Mountain View Campus Are Breathtaking By Zara Ali Feb 28, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Google Mountain View campus Two years ago, Google publicly shared its vision for a revolutionary Mountain View campus. Over time, the tech giant overhauled its plans and changed the architectural language for the campus. Google recently shared renders for the upcoming campus. The renders look amazing, and if that’s what Google has in mind for the future campus, then we can’t wait to see it turning into reality soon. In the renders, Google states that there will be a massive canopy inside the campus, which will take control of the indoor climate, quality of air, and sound. This new square structure is being built outside the Googleplex. The tech giant wants the canopy to complement the existing design language that the company follows for other buildings. Google’s Mountain View campus will be open for general public as well. Google calls it a “destination for the local community.” The ground floor of the campus will be open every day from morning till evening. It will also house a pedestrian pathway that will lead visitors inside the main building. The ground floor of the building will also be a destination for restaurants and shops that will be open for residents, visitors, employees, and others. Google also says that the campus will have some open spaces, right from a public plaza to “quieter and more intimate spaces for collaboration and private conversation.” The building will be environmental friendly with parks and other green spaces, which Google calls “Green Loop.” Pathways will surround the entire green area for walking and cycling. Advertisement The second floor will be dedicated to employees, and it will feature “highly flexible and reconfigurable” spaces. Google’s dream campus is turning into a reality after Google and LinkedIn agreed to exchange their lands. The construction of the new campus might take more than 30 months after getting approval from Mountain View City Council. The project has already been reviewed and discussed by City Council Study Session and Development Review Committee in July 2016. The renders of the Mountain View campus are breathtaking, and the best part is that Google will be making it accessible to the general public as well. What’s your thought on the Mountain View campus?

Live Watch Google's Top 17 Easter Eggs, Gags, and Hoaxes By ABC News March 20, 2008 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email Buried Deep in Google Google Web site--and many of the company's software programs--are loaded with gags, goofs, and Easter eggs that have helped Google maintain a fun-loving spirit in the cutthroat world of Web competition. Of course, Google always has a good idea. Thousands of our readers have enjoyed past explorations of wonders like "The Strangest Sites in Google Earth" and "The Most Spectacular Sights in Google Sky." So when we heard stories of hidden teddy bears, a Google Romance beta service, and early morning appearances of the Loch Ness monster on Google home pages, we had to check them out. And most of them turned out to be true. Take a look. --Tom Spring, PC WorldGoogle's Official Easter Egg Game It's one thing to find Easter eggs, and it's another thing to catch them. In the spirit of Easter, Google has posted its Google egg drop game--where you, acting as a rabbit, hop up and down and to and fro, trying to put all of your eggs in one basket. The only real point of this game other than to catch eggs that spell out G-O-O-G-L-E. Sorry: No chocolate eggs for those who win. Something Spooky Just After 3 A.M. You could take the high road (or the low road) to Scotland's Loch Ness in hopes of spotting the elusive Nessie, the legendary monster said to reside there. But if you'd rather do your mythic beastie viewing at home in the wee hours of the morning, set your alarm to 3:14 a.m. and your browser to the Beach themed iGoogle page. At precisely that o'clock each day, Nessie surfaces for 60 seconds, then takes a deep breath and dives back under the dark loch's surface. Why that time of the morning? Well, according to programmer's lore, Google developers did it to pay homage to the mathematical quantity pi. Other iGoogle pages using themes have spooky Easter eggs of their own. In the Seasonal Scape, the Northern Lights also appear at 3:14 a.m. Look for UFOs to descend on the City Scape. A monster appears in Spring Scape; and in the Tea House theme, ghostlike fox spirits (well known in Japanese folklore) appear and disappear in the mist of the lake as the fox sleeps.Measuring Spam by the Pound Ever wish you could simply press a button and have all of your Gmail messages printed, sorted, boxed, and shipped to your front door? If you care about keeping your carbon footprint at something smaller than Paul Bunyan dimensions, you'll be glad to know that no such service exists--despite an elaborate hoax Google perpetrated to make Gmail users believe otherwise. As part of a 2007 April Fool's Day joke, Google announced the debut of Gmail Paper, which would allow users to create a hard copy of their entire Gmail account. In a nod toward environmental consciousness, Google said that it would avoid cutting trees down to print people's Gmail archives, instead using paper composed of "96 percent post-consumer organic soybean sputum. Oh well.Google Searches in Klingon or Fudd The United Nations may not recognize Klingon as a language, but that hasn't stopped Google from catering to the fictitious species of extraterrestrial anthropomorphs from the Star Trek series with a specialized Klingon search engine. Nor has it prevented Google from developing a number of other specialty search engine interfaces, including Elmer Fudd and Pig Latin. Google also serves up specialty searches that cater to humans and others who seek information regarding Microsoft, Linux, and BSD Unix.Google Gulp for Smarter Searching In 2005, Google decided that--instead of just making Google searches smarter--it would try to make the people conducting Google searches smarter as well. The solution--literally--was Google Gulp Beta, a drink formulated in four yummy flavors (Glutamate Grape, Sugar-Free Radical, Beta Carroty, and Sero-Tonic Water). The secret ingredient: a chemical compound designed to optimize the drinker's use of the Google search engine by rendering the individual more intelligent. For all you non-MENSA members, here's the bad news: It was another Google hoax. Oh, well--back to MSG and syrupy radicals...Soaring Across Google Earth Buried in the free mapping program Google Earth is a nifty flight simulator that lets you either hop into the cockpit of an F16 fighter jet or a lightweight SR22 propeller-powered airplane. To access the flight simulator in Google Earth, open the program and press Ctrl-Alt-A on your keyboard (Command-Option-A on a Mac). In addition, Google provides keyboard shortcuts for desktop pilots.Adding It Up With Google Calculator Thanks to Google Calculator, you can use the Google search box for serious number crunching--anything from converting currency to solving advanced math equations. But things don't always add up the way you think they will with Google Calculator. Try searching for "answer to life the universe and everything," "number of horns on a unicorn," or "once in a blue moon" for unexpected computations.Google Gets Romantic--Sort Of Since 2000, Google has honored Every April Fool's Day by preying on the gullible. In 2006, it went after lonely hearts with a Google Romance beta program, which purported to offer "users both a psychographic matchmaking service and all-expenses-paid dates for couples who agree to experience contextually relevant advertising throughout the course of their evening." Did you fall for it?Unsanctioned Googles: Goth y Loco To find this hidden Google treasure, type 'Google Gothic' into the Google search field and--instead of hitting the Search button--select 'I'm feeling lucky.' You'll see Googoth, a specialized search engine that caters to "dark, gothic, industrial, and alternative topics." This search site is not related to Google. Another specialized site unrelated to Google is Google Loco, a parody of Google that's rife with bouncy characters and flashing colors. Tip: Try Google Loco in Internet Explorer for an even better, muy loco experience. Google Street Views Credits The Google employees that make our favorite cool Google services often go unrecognized. But that's not the case with Google Street Views. In a rare Google display of self-acclaim. the Google Street View team posed in the back of the company's Googleplex headquarters in Mountain View, California in--you guessed it--a Google Street View. Picasa's Mysterious Bear(s) Google's free image editing and management software Picasa has a wild side that few people know about. Open Picasa and press Ctrl-Shift-Y, and a teddy bear will pop up. Keep pressing those keys and watch out for the sloth (or sleuth) of red-bowtied bears that take over the program. Psychic Google Have you ever been too lazy to type in your Google search query? If so, consider Google MentalPlex search. This Google service figures out what you're looking for before you touch the keyboard, by analyzing the previous five sites you visited and factoring in your local air pressure, your astrological sign, and the "speed and vector of your mouse movements." Okay, you didn't have to conduct an imaginary search to figure this one out: Google MentalPlex was the April Fool's Day hoax for 2000.The Many Faces of Pegman To use the Google Street Views feature in Google Maps, you move what Google calls the Pegman (he's visible in this video) to a specific spot. When you do, up pops the Street View window. To keep things interesting, Google dresses up Pegman on special occasions. For instance, during the week of Christmas, Pegman becomes a snowman; at Halloween, Pegman dons a witch costume; on Valentine's Day, Pegman stands on a heart instead of his usual green circle; and whenever Pegman sets foot on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, California, he becomes a tie-dye-shirted hippie. Classic Google Maps Easter Egg A while back, if you asked for directions from, say, New York City to Paris on Google Maps, you would be informed that what objectively appears to be a swim of some 3462 miles across the Atlantic Ocean was in fact merely a stroll of two dozen steps. Last year Google removed this Easter Egg from Google Maps, saying figuratively: "You can't get there from here." Free Broadband Wi-Fi Goes to Pot Cheapskates rejoice. If you ever wished for no-cost broadband Internet access without having to steal it from your neighbor or discommode yourself in any way, Google's free (but advertising-supported) TiSP service is a dream come true. To get TiSP (short for Toilet Internet Service Provider), you first obtain a free self-install kit from Google. Next, you flush one end of the fiber-optic cable (included in kit) down the toilet and then wait for about an hour while the line is connected to the Internet via a "Plumbing Hardware Dispatcher (PHD)." Now hook up your Google wireless router and you're done. Yeah, it was a Google hoax. Fine Dining With Spam If you go to your Spam Folder in Gmail, you'll notice that where you might expect to see an ad of some type, you instead see a recipe that features Spam as the main ingredient. Spam Imperial Tortilla Sandwiches, anyone? Or how about Spam Quiche? For other gastronomical options that feature the pink slab, keep checking your Gmail Spam box. The GoogleTV Beta That Never Was The best Google Easter Egg may be GoogleTV. Simply follow the steps outlined by Infinite Solutions host Mark Erickson in this instructional video. The bad news: If you hope to gain on-demand streaming access to ABC, CBC, NBC, and Fox's primetime line-ups, you'll be sorely disappointed.

It began with an inquisitive mind, a desire to locate the figure portrayed so affectionately within Christian circles. Linvoy Primus An internet search paid dividends, with Google obligingly tracking down the man who spent eight-and-a-half years at Fratton Park. And how Pompey’s rangy midfielder is basking in life on the south coast having at last made Primus’ acquaintance. ‘It’s a funny story,’ said Linganzi. ‘I spent five years in England before going back to France and last summer was with a friend who is a Christian. ‘He asked whether I had heard of Linvoy Primus? I hadn’t. ‘Not long after, I called Leam (Richardson), who I was keeping in contact with, and he asked me to come to Portsmouth on trial. ‘While over here, I was looking for a Christian church to attend and went to two or three. Again, people were asking “Have you heard of Linvoy Primus?” ‘So I went on to Google, checked the Faith and Football website and sent an email. An hour later someone answered. ‘Within two days I met Mick Mellows and then step-by-step we all became friends. ‘I didn’t know Linvoy, all the players I was aware of were more in France, not in England, this is why I hadn’t heard of him. ‘Having met him, I have discovered he has been player of the year at Portsmouth and I am not surprised. ‘God is good and does good things. ‘Together with Mick Mellows, they have helped me a lot at a time when it wasn’t easy. ‘When I arrived here I had no car and lived in a hotel for a few months, then stayed in a club house for a few months, yet it was difficult. ‘I am married, I am a husband, I am a father, and couldn’t spend time with my wife and son, who were back in France. ‘Then you learn to be patient – and that is my strength now.’ Now reunited with his family and living in Waterlooville, Linganzi has fully adjusted to life on the south coast. It began with a trial, followed by a spot as an unused substitute in the pre-season fixture at Steve Claridge’s Salisbury in July. He remained in the Blues’ squad for the final three summer friendlies, before earning a month-by-month deal on the eve of the campaign. These days, Linganzi is established as a regular during Pompey’s encouraging current momentum towards the automatic promotion spots. The 27-year-old is enjoying his longest period yet in the Blues’ first-team in League Two, lining up in the past six matches. A groin injury collected in the midweek draw with Morecambe threatens to bundle him out of Paul Cook’s side for today’s visit of Crewe. Nonetheless, Linganzi’s powerful midfield presence has impressed the Fratton faithful and seen him taken into their hearts. The acceptance is reciprocated during a period in which the product of Saint-Etienne’s youth system believes he has finally discovered peace. Signed by Sam Allardyce in January 2010 for then Premier League side Blackburn, there were high hopes for Linganzi. A debut at Aston Villa in front of 41,799 supporters, only to be substituted at half-time, represented one of three top-flight appearances. Spells at Preston, Accrington and Gillingham then followed, before leaving the English game in March 2015 when his Gills contract was cancelled by mutual consent. Then arrived the moment which Linganzi credits with changing his life. He added: ‘I left Gillingham, went to France and my faith was born again. ‘When you are born again you get a test and I did my test in France. I had my big car and was in the third division with Frejus Saint-Raphael. ‘Everybody knew I had played in England, played a few games in the Premier League, and became a bit jealous. ‘So it was tough, but I stayed strong. I am walking with Jesus, I have no fear. ‘I had been struggling for about a good seven or eight years in football, since the beginning of my career. I was struggling with everything. ‘Now I’m here and that is my past – I am looking to my future.’ Signed up to Fratton Park until the season’s end, he is among many whose presence remains uncertain beyond this summer. Pompey’s continued involvement in the promotion push ensures all contract discussions are currently on hold. In the meantime, Linganzi’s reputation continues to be enhanced, serving alongside Michael Doyle as the team’s holding midfielders. Softly-spoken and cutting a relaxed figure, he is comfortable speaking English, irrespective of a background which saw him born in Algeria, raised in France and represent DR Congo internationally. Linganzi’s faith has been the crucial driving force behind his re-emergence in the English game. And he is keen to use his life experiences to benefit others. He added: ‘Most footballers have many issues, especially those earning lots of money. They have issues with gambling, drugs and alcohol. ‘I know this football world and I am a Christian. ‘If younger players like Conor Chaplin or Nicke Kabamba, for example, wanted to talk then I will do everything for them. ‘When you are shining it’s good, when you come down then no-one is here for you and you can become weak mentally. ‘But you must walk with humility, accept there is something bigger than you, accept there is a creator. Then you just relax yourself and things will come to you.’ Back to the top of the page Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

Amit Singhal had joined Uber in January as senior vice president of engineering after working for 15 years at Google, where he oversaw the internet giant’s search efforts. A report in Recode said Uber CEO Travis Kalanick asked Singhal to resign on Monday after it was found that Singhal did not disclose to the car-hailing firm he had left Google a year earlier after an allegation against him of sexual harassment. Google had deemed the employee’s claim of sexual harassment against Singhal “credible” in an investigation. The report said Singhal, “a highly regarded engineer in Silicon Valley”, had disputed the allegation to Google executives at the time and denied the allegations again. The report claimed that Google was prepared to fire Singhal over the allegations after probe but did not have to do so after he resigned. The employee who filed the complaint against Singhal did not work for him directly, but worked closely with the search team, the report said, adding that she also did not want to go public with the charges. “Harassment is unacceptable in any setting. I certainly want everyone to know that I do not condone and have not committed such behaviour,” Singhal said. “In my 20-year career, I have never been accused of anything like this before and the decision to leave Google was my own,” he said. Singhal’s departure comes at a time when Uber is facing scrutiny following allegations of sexual harassment by a former female employee against her manager. She said in a blog post last week that her manager had sent inappropriate messages to her and the company’s human resource department were not supportive.

There were some postponement of purchases, but it was quite quick.” Airtel was hurt largely by Reliance Jio’s “Welcome Offer” of giving data free. More details here.

The Internet is both communication and publishing, and regulating content creators is tricky without curbing free speech. How do you treat people who share fake news differently from those who create it? Should there be regulation? How do you ensure that the safe harbour, which provides amnesty for intermediaries and platforms, and has led to the growth of the Internet, is retained? During the #NAMApolicy discussion on Fake News, Rumours and Online content regulation, we looked into both technology and legal means of addressing Fake News.

Read it here The Anatomy of Fake News Following a passionate (heated?) discussion at MediaNama’s event on Fake News last week, many people asked me to publish my views on the subject. In this post, I would like to address a few aspects of this issue, on which everyone from Twitter pundits to Donald Trump has a point of view: Is Fake News a new/Recent /Nascent phenomenon? I don’t think so. The idea of Fake news is probably as old as the idea of news itself, and the same applies to the idea of using Fake News for electoral benefits. The first recorded incident of using fake news goes back to Rome in 1522, where Pietro Aretino tried to manipulate the pontifical election by writing wicked sonnets about all the candidates except his favorite one. The NewYork Review of Books recently published a fascinating post on history of Fake News( link). Read it here “Idea will embark on a massive cost saving initiative in 2017”: Idea MD Himanshu Kapania Idea Cellular will “embark on a massive cost saving initiative in calendar year 2017” across its operation in order to “optimize costs, eliminate wastage and duplication, digitize processes, and simplify (operations),” the company’s Managing Director Himanshu Kapania mentioned in a recent analyst call. Kapania did not mention when the cost cuts would be carried out but added the “the impact of some of these cost reduction initiatives should reflect in the financial year 2017-2018 results.” Read it here J.S Deepak removed as telecom secretary J.S Deepak, the telecom secretary for Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has been effectively removed from his post and moved temporarily to the Department of Commerce as Officer on Special Duty (OSD), reports PTI.

Read it here Zee is reworking Ditto TV strategy after dropping prices last year Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. (ZEEL) is looking to revamp the company’s OTT strategy for Ditto TV. Admitting to the significant under performance of Ditto TV in comparison with STAR TV’s Hotstar, during the earning call in Q3 FY17, Punit Goenka, MD & CEO of ZEEL noted that the company plans to roll out the new strategy during the second half of the current calendar year. When asked about the Ditto TV’s numbers, Goenka declined to comment on it stating that it would be irrelevant to disclose numbers, with the changing strategy.

Daniel Cooper, @danielwcooper 02.28.17 in Internet Comments 676 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Getty Images/Flickr RF If you didn't think that Google was into everything before, wait until it's providing the infrastructure for your mobile network. The company has announced that it's building tools for cellular carriers to use to run their businesses. Businesses such as India's Bharti Airtel and South Korea's SK Telecom have both signed up to use Google's new platform for network services. Long story short, Google knows how to run a pretty big network, given that it's running both its own branded services, Android and YouTube. By sharing its know-how, it's expected that the networks can cut costs on hardware and be faster to implement new features. Google uses innovations like YouTube's Smart Offline, that trickle-downloads clips overnight when data costs drop, as one such example. It's also another step towards becoming an infrastructure provider for a much bigger chunk of the world's services. After all, Google already runs its own fiber business, as well as a burgeoning mobile network in the form of Project Fi. The search engine is also contributing to an open-source project to improve cloud computing, CORD. That puts it alongside other heavy-hitters like AT&T, China Unicom, NTT and Verizon.

(BigStock Image) More schools are using tablets and laptops in classrooms than ever before, and, in the U.S., Google is leading the charge. Last year, more 12.6 million mobile devices were shipped to schools around the United States. Google Chromebooks accounted for more than half of those, while Microsoft and Apple fell behind, according to a new report by Futuresource Consulting. Google’s growth in the U.S. education technology sector has been quick as well – in 2013, Chromebooks only made up 38 percent of the market. (Futuresource Image) Google’s grip on the education market can be largely attributed to price. Chromebooks remain the most affordable option for schools, with devices costing as low as $120 in some cases. This price point makes them more appealing for schools that have to worry about devices getting lost or broken. Other technology companies now have to lower their price to remain competitive. In January, Microsoft announced Windows 10-powered partner devices that will cost as little as $189. These devices will include the recently launched Microsoft Classroom and the central Microsoft management platform Intune for Education. A cloud-based device management system has been Google’s edge in the sector. It allows schools to easily set up students’ devices remotely and means students can store documents in the cloud and access them from whichever device is nearby. Chromebooks also feature the G Suite productivity tools and Google Classroom.  Microsoft has made huge strides in developing its education ecosystem offering in the past year, with major announcements on both the devices and platform side. Mike Fisher, Futuresource’s associate director of education, said that, while Microsoft is improving its education tools, schools continue to prefer Google’s platform because of its simplicity. “Microsoft has made huge strides in developing its education ecosystem offering in the past year, with major announcements on both the devices and platform side,” Fisher said in a news release. “To date however, these developments have not stopped Google’s momentum within the US K-12 market. Microsoft continues to face challenges to win back end-user mindshare.” In classrooms abroad, however, it’s a different story. Microsoft dominates the international education sector, accounting for 65 percent of all mobile device sales abroad last year. Overall device sales to schools outside of the U.S. fell 26 percent last year, with only 13.6 million units sold. This likely is due to a variety of factors, Futuresource said, including fewer national projects focused on deploying mobile devices. Microsoft led the market in international mobile device sales to schools, with Google coming in at less than 30 percent. Much of Google’s and Microsoft’s growth has come at the expense of Apple, which has seen a significant decrease in its grip on the education market. In the last three years, sales of iPads to classrooms have steadily fallen. Apple devices accounted for only 14 percent sales in the U.S. in 2016. While iPads have long appealed to classrooms with younger children, older students need keyboards to do work. Apple doesn’t offer an affordable option in that area. Microsoft and Google, however, are creating 2-in-1 products that feature a keyboard and stylus for under $300. Overall, Futuresource notes in the report, this competition between companies has made mobile devices more accessible to schools. “PC provider’s laser focus on the education sector is good news for schools and students,” Fisher said. “2017 will see wide ranges of computing devices, designed specifically for education and at competitive price points, entering the market and vying to be the device of choice for learning.” Jillian Stampher is a journalist based out of Seattle with a focus on breaking news reporting and digital media.

Samsung revealed the new kit at this weekend’s World Mobile Congress in Barcelona. The new system now includes a dedicated controller, not entirely dissimilar to that included with rival Google Daydream. It’s designed to be held like a remote control, includes a touchpad and is motion sensitive. Like Daydream, it can also serve as a point and click device, although it advances on Google’s design a little by incorporating a trigger, making it ideally suited to VR shooter titles. It will be compatible with all existing titles, although 70+ apps that are designed to take advantage of it are apparently in development. Certainly, the move will help devs create titles designed to run across both smartphone VR standards. The Gear VR headset itself includes a strap for holding the controller when not in use – again, like Daydream. The headset’s specs remain the same, boasting 42mm lenses and a 101 degree field of view. It is compatible with the S7, S7 edge, Note5, S6 edge+, S6 and S6 edge. The original Gear VR has sold over 5m units worldwide, making it the world’s most successful VR headset. By comparison, PSVR has sold 910k units since October, and as of December 31st 2016 estimates for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift stood at 420k and 243k respectively. Mobile-based VR offers very few bells and whistles compared to PC and console VR, but is significantly cheaper and far more accessible, requiring only the phone in your pocket. Google Daydream is the most recent competitor to enter the smartphone VR sector. Initially it was only compatible with Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL handsets, although other manufacturers are now adding compatibility to their latest models. Daydream does well for the price, but is still a very limited experience in comparison to the likes of Vive and Rift. The controller, for one, lacks the precision required to play high-end games. Titles tend to run at a slower framerate too, which added to the lack of precise tracking can make the experience a bit vomit-inducing for some. More worryingly for Google, the Daydream experience has led to some overheating problems for some Pixel owners.

But at this year’s proceedings, the artificially intelligent voice-based service struggled to be heard above the din of an army of rival assistants that will soon jostle for attention on smartphones. As the event kicked off Sunday, the search giant announced the Google Assistant would ship on all new phones running its popular Android operating system. The same day, Motorola said its latest Android phones would come with Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa voice-based helper, Google’s nemesis. Executives at Motorola parent Lenovo Group Ltd. explained later that consumers who buy the latest Motorola phones can use both Alexa and Google’s assistant. Soon, they’ll even have a third option: the Chinese manufacturer plans to roll out its own AI-powered service on its devices this year. “I don’t really believe in the supremacy of one assistant,” Lenovo Vice President of Product Dan Dery said in an interview, describing the plan as “bringing AI to hardware.” Google’s version represents one of the company’s biggest bets since it began building a novel web search engine in 1998. It wants to remain the main source of digital information as people talk to their computers more, rather than type. That will require its assistant to be on as many gadgets as possible. But Google’s hardware partners are also betting voice-based computing could be the next big thing, rivalling the mobile boom. VoiceLabs estimates 24.5 million voice-based devices will ship this year in the US, up from 6.5 million in 2016. Amazon leads, while Google is trying to catch up quickly. There’s also a rush to deploy AI techniques, resulting in a Mobile World Congress awash in digital helpers. South Korea’s SK Telecom Co. displayed “Nugu,” an internet-connected speaker akin to Amazon’s Alexa-powered Echo. Line Corp. introduced “Clova.” Deutsche Telekom AG had “Tinka,” a customer service chat bot.  Last month, HTC Corp. introduced Sense Companion, a personal companion service with voice-recognition, on its newest Android phone. Even Will.i.am, a hip hop star-turned-tech-entrepreneur, is working on an assistant. When a reporter asked for a demonstration at the conference, the service struggled to follow commands.  Aside from Apple Inc., smartphone makers have largely failed to wring profit from software-based services and lessen their dependence on hardware businesses beset by shrinking margins. Samsung Electronics Co. built its own mobile operating system, with little success, and Samsung Pay vies for mobile purchases with Google’s Android Pay on many smartphones. Samsung is trying again with assistants. In the fall, it acquired Viv Labs, a startup formed by the creators of Apple’s Siri assistant, and is expected to release a digital helper with its newest phone in March. Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer denied these efforts undercut Google’s assistant. ”A lot of [original equipment manufacturers] will choose to do that because they see value in assistants,” he said in Barcelona. “Competition is good.”  Privately, other Google employees said they are less concerned that hardware or telecom companies will build a better digital assistant. Google’s search engine provides ready answers to millions of questions for its voice-based service, and the company has thousands of skilled engineers working on the project — resources that these other firms may struggle to match. A larger concern is Amazon. The e-commerce giant has built a network of software development partners for Alexa, a service that, like Amazon’s flagship online shopping service, could dent Google’s core business of finding and delivering information. If Alexa is on a lot of Android phones, alongside the Google Assistant, which service will answer when people ask their devices valuable questions like which nearby restaurant to book or what holiday gifts to buy? In January, Amazon announced it was bringing the service to Huawei Technologies Inc. phones sold outside of China. Then came Lenovo at MWC. The story of the Chinese company’s Motorola division is a painfully familiar tale for anyone involved in Android. While it’s the most popular software for running phones, Android manufacturers have struggled to make money on hardware, while Google scoops up billions of dollars from mobile services and related ads flowing through the devices.  Lenovo bought the Motorola hardware business from Google in 2014 and the integration has been tough: in the third quarter, Lenovo reported a US$112 million (RM499 million) loss from its mobile division, compared with US$30 million a year earlier. Dery, a former Motorola Vice President who returned to the brand in July, is tasked with breathing new life into the business.  Digital assistants are key to his plan. Lenovo’s coming voice-based service will rely on a personal identifier attached to all users of its hardware, allowing it to work consistently across Lenovo phones, tablets, desktop and laptop computers, said Dery. Dery described this as a supplement to the assistants from Amazon and Google. While those two services mostly respond to queries and commands, Lenovo’s will send notifications and alerts based on predictions about users’ behaviour and needs, according to the executive. “We don’t like to call it an assistant because it’s misleading in a way,” he said. “This is something which is always aware, in the background, syncing for you.”  By Dery’s telling, Amazon was quite pleased to hear about his broader AI strategy. “We shared that whole plan with Amazon and they realised, ‘Wow, this is exactly the missing piece for putting Alexa in everyone’s pocket,’” he said. Google wasn’t upset by the move either, he insisted. “They know our plan as well,” Dery said.Still, the more digital assistants get crammed into devices, the more crowding for Google. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week From voice to written notes via Ukrainian Senstone device (VIDEO) Google vows fix for ‘inappropriate’ search results Consumer Reports to consider cyber security in product reviews ‘Pokemon Go’ player dies from heart attack after catching rare Lapras in Singapore Facebook launches City Guides in latest app update China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard ‘Pokemon Go’ player dies from heart attack after catching rare Lapras in Singapore Axiata Digital, Huawei sign MoU to bring Internet of Things capabilities across Asia Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Related Articles Google vows fix for ‘inappropriate’ search results Five trends at Mobile World Congress Spotify hits 50 million paid subscribers, lifting music industry Amazon reveals 2017 pilot season lineup Ancient human tree cultivation shaped Amazon landscape Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

With nine updates over the course of twelve months, the push to deliver better search results based on user intent was at the forefront of Google’s efforts. Prioritizing the user and customizing content - from search results to personalized recommendations - goes hand-in-hand with the 2016 push for putting the customer first. Making sense of what the updates mean for your small business website can be tricky. However, E2M Solutions have pulled together the below infographic which encapsulates each update in layman’s terms. The fully animated infographic is viewable at the bottom of the page, but for those curious to know more about each update, here's a summary of each key element. Core Algorithm Update The year’s first algorithm update, appropriately termed “core update” by Google, significantly impacted rankings for a great number of websites. Google was reticent to call it anything more than a quality update, and said it was not linked to either Panda nor Penguin updates. Essentially, spam websites were moved down in search rankings to make room for real business sites. AdWords Placement At the end of February, Google adjusted its AdWords settings, and the pesky right-hand ad bar disappeared from Google searches. Instead, the top four ads - which was a sizable increase given that only one to three ads were previously displayed - were now listed first after the search results. While this was great for advertisers, this change has taken a toll on organic search results and their click through rates. AMP Listings The day after the AdWords update, Google launched its AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) listings in mobile search results. This translated to another change in the layout of search results - now, the AMP listings appeared above the top results or in a carousel format. This was a big step for publishers and advertisers as it gave them increased visibility and faster load times, which improved click through rates. Unconfirmed Update Google never made an official statement about this May update, but those closely monitoring search rankings and SERPs noticed an uptick in activity. Again, think of this as quality control of illegitimate websites. Mobile-Friendly 2 Google admitted to this update, which supported ranking boosts to mobile-friendly websites on mobile search. This was good news if you had recently optimized your website, as it helped your website rank higher on mobile, where so many searches are being conducted. If you haven’t optimized your website yet, now is the time. Possum In September, the Possum update went live, targeting the 3-pack and local, or more commonly known Google Maps results. While, again, this was unconfirmed by Google, it noticeably impacted website rankings based on local parameters and helped hide spam sites. Universal Results Shakeup Later in September, Google cleaned house and remove almost 50% of image results connected to SERPs. As you can imagine, this caused a major ranking upheaval and people took notice. This change made room for more organic Page One search results, which was amazing for businesses. Many images previously found on Page One results were moved to Page Two and beyond in order to bring more relevant SERP content to Page One content. Penguin 4 After a two-year break, Penguin 4 was launched and served to halt a significant amount of spam on a page-by-page basis. The biggest note about this update is that it’s ongoing, so for businesses with penalized web pages, they can quickly adjust the page, and Google will review in real-time. No longer will businesses be banned or put on hold because of a systematic algorithm update. Unconfirmed Update Last but not least, Google ended the year with a third unconfirmed update. Speculation suggests that this update was tied to mobile-first index testing, which would be rolled out at a later date. Only those with their finger on the pulse of SERPs noticed the change, and there were mixed reviews about its strength and total impact. It’s safe to assume that this was a minor update that will be tied to future algorithm updates and the state of website rankings in general.

Home Industry Google to unveil new Pixel phone this year Google to unveil new Pixel phone this year US tech giant Google will release a new Pixel smartphone later this year. The device, with the built-in personal Google Assistant, will directly competes with the Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. By: IANS | New York | Published: March 4, 2017 12:11 PM Google pixel phone (Image representation by Reuters) US tech giant Google will release a new Pixel smartphone later this year. The device, with the built-in personal Google Assistant, will directly competes with the Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. “The device will remain ‘premium’ in its next iteration and the company is not interested in offering a low-cost version, preferring instead to let that segment be addressed by its external hardware partners,” techcrunch.com quoted Rick Osterloh, Google SVP of Hardware as saying. Launched last year, Pixel is the first smartphone that works as an intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator. The 5-inch smartphone is equipped with Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM and runs on Android Nougat 7.0 operating system. The device also has Pixel Imprint — a fingerprint scanner on the back of the smartphone for quick access to all apps, texts and e-mails. Please Wait while comments are loading...

(1) (2) (3) (4) (0) (1) (Reply) (Go Down) 4 Reasons Why You Should Update Your Blog Regularly by NaijaTechGuy: 6:47am On Mar 04 Blogging has changed how most businesses work. However, If your blog is the headquarter of the world's most boring posts, you don’t need to read further. In every niche you choose you'll face high competition . Your first priority is to avoid losing your readers by hitting them with outdated content. Most readers stay glued to your site by frequently reading the new contents. Here are some reasons why you should update your blog regularly 1. It'll Boost your Site Ranking On Google Google prefers regularly updated content and if the relationship of Google with your blog decreases, it can be an uphill task for you to gain it back.The longer you write, the higher you rank. Remember that "Content is king". 2. Images and Structure An amazing list post that you wrote last year with a title “6 Best kinds smartphones in Nigeria in 2016” is hardly a clickable title in 2017 while the content was interesting enough that bought tons of shares back in 2016. Try to share it again with a little twist. Replace 2016 with 2017 with some tweaks in content and the images. 3 Readers Want To Read New Posts If a reader always gets to see outdated information on your blog, he automatically gets builds a negative ideology in his mind. In case a reader does not find the solution to his problem, A negative impact remains in his mind and People remember negative things more than the positive ones . 4. You Attract New Readers Assuming you have 1k daily readers today that number will increase with the time as a result of publishing content regularly. Also, you gain email subscribers and introduce your blog to a new readers base Most of the new readers won't know the blog posts that you published a while ago. So resurrecting old content will increase traffic from new readers.

YouTube is awesome. But it can be even more awesome, if you know the right sites and apps to make it better. The developers at YouTube work hard to make apps that improve your experience. But there’s only so much they can do. The fans are the ones who really take YouTube to new levels. From finding videos which have never been watched before to making it easier to build playlists, there’s something for everyone here. 1. YouTube Go (Android): Download Videos and Save Data There are hundreds of ways to download YouTube videos to your hard drive, but this is the first official app to let you do that. Google launched YouTube Go a few months ago in India, with the aim to make YouTube access easier for those on slow or limited internet plans. YouTube Go lets users download videos in different qualities, thus saving data. It also shows previews of videos, which lets a user scan the whole clip without having to stream or download it. The best part, perhaps, is that you can share YouTube videos with others on the YouTube Go app without using any data. The app is now available for anyone to download You Can Now Test the Brand New YouTube App You Can Now Test the Brand New YouTube App YouTube Go is hiding in plain sight on the Google Play Store right now, so it would be rude not to give it a quick spin, right?!

Tubelister (Chrome): Turn YouTube Tabs Into Single Playlist Oh Tubelister, where have you been all my life? This right here is perhaps the most important Chrome extension for anyone who loves YouTube. In a nutshell, it will take all your open YouTube tabs and turn it into a single playlist. Most people open several YouTube tabs in the course of a browsing session. Not only does that slow down your browser, but you might just miss a video or two. Instead, get Tubelister and click the icon. All your tabs will be turned into a YouTube playlist, starting from the first to the last tab. The playlist won’t be automatically saved, so doing that will be up to you if you want to keep it for posterity.

QueueTube (Chrome): Search YouTube Without Stopping Videos The biggest problem with YouTube is that if you are watching a video, you can’t search for more videos in the same tab. Do that and YouTube will stop the video to take you to a new page with the search results. Opening a new tab with YouTube messes with your flow. This is why you need QueueTube. With QueueTube, search results appear in the right-side pane where you usually see related videos. This way, you can continue searching for new things on YouTube and adding them to your playlist, without ever pausing your video. It’s one of the best extensions for Chrome, and it also works on any Chromium-based browser.

The host has full control over playback, and the songs play only from the host’s speakers, no one else’s. For anyone else with the link, they just get to add songs. It’s exceptionally easy to use, which is the hallmark of a great app to share music playlists 6 Awesome Ways to Find and Share Music Playlists 6 Awesome Ways to Find and Share Music Playlists Streaming music services are growing ever more popular, and this means the ability to create and share playlists with family and friends have got easier than ever.

Then on December 5th the company officially released Android 7.1.1 Nougat for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P and Pixel C tablet. Additionally, it’s available for the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. Below is everything you need to know about Nexus Android Nougat updates. Many of the features users love on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are exclusive to that phone. However, with Android 7.1.1 Nougat some are available for all Android devices, starting with Nexus phones. To kick-off January Google’s already released their latest Android 7.1.1 update and security bulletin. Read: Google Pixel Review: A New Generation of Android As promised, in December the final Android 7.1.1 Nexus update arrived for Nexus smartphones and tablets. Including the new Pixel. At this point all owners should have it, and can expect another update to arrive in January. Other manufacturers are working hard to deliver the same. Like Samsung and Motorola. Android 7.1.1 Nougat includes a few new features and additional tweaks over the original release, and more could be coming soon. The developer preview is over, Google released factory images and OTA files. At this point all Nexus devices should be on the new software. The first release had some new software features first shown off on the Pixel. Some of those included round icons, app shortcuts on the homescreen and launcher icons, image and GIF support in the keyboard, Night Light and more. The second developer preview looks to mostly be bug fixes, and added a slew of new emoji characters. Which Devices Are Getting Android 7.1.1 Nougat? Of course Google’s new Pixel and Pixel XL run the latest software, and they already received the newest version. Build NMF26O. Furthermore, the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel C tablet, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player are getting it too. Google claimed the Nexus 6 would be added on the 2nd preview, but that never happened. Android 7.1 is still missing for the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. That said, the Nexus 6 Android 7.1.1 update is finally available as of January 5th. In closing, those who were running the beta were oddly last to receive over the air updates to the official release. My Pixel C tablet didn’t get it until December 26th, and others could be experiencing the same problem. How to Get Android 7.1.1 Nougat There are multiple ways to install Android 7.1.1 Nougat today. The easiest of them all however, is to just wait for the over-the-air notification on your device. If you haven’t received it yet, follow any of the steps below. Join the Android 7.1 Nougat Beta (click here) and Enroll your device Download and Install the Factory Image (Instructions) Download and flash the OTA update files manually (click here) Read: Android 7.0 vs Android 6.0 Marshmallow: What’s New Alternatively users can manually install the factory image like many have been doing for years. This is more intensive, requires a full wipe and erase of the device, and is more involved. Then the third method is similar to the beta and over the air update, just done manually. Basically side-loading the update files. This takes some know-how, and will not erase your device. Those on the beta cannot side-load from it to the official build without a full wipe. Android 7.1.1 Nougat Release Date As of right now 7.1.1 Nougat is only available for the devices mentioned above, and running on Pixel phones. It was released on December 5th and now in 2017 everyone should have it. If you own the Nexus 6 by Motorola, we have good news. After a short wait Google released factory images and all files of Android 7.1.1 on January 5th. Enjoy it. In closing, those with a Nexus or Pixel are getting the January security patch starting on the 3rd. Expect OTAs to rollout for the first 7-10 days of January. Those with devices from Samsung and others will need to wait a little while longer for Nougat. Motorola and OnePlus are the few to already release Nougat for their devices. At this point there is no information to suggest Google is working on a version of Android 7.1.2 Nougat, but other maintenance releases could be on the way as 2017 continues. That all said for those who aren’t enjoying Nougat, here are fixes for any potential problems you may be facing. 17 Responses 10/20/2016 liviaemily_6 Reply Android 7.1 Developer Preview now available for Nexus 5X, 6P and Pixel C 11/28/2016 John Mitton Reply Google released final Android 7.1.1 Developer sample 2 for Nexus devices earlier this week. Google will release Android 7.1.1 update to Nexus 6P on December 6. 12/17/2016 Paul Reply is 7.1.1 OTA for 6P yet?

My Nexus 5X has yet to receive 7.1.1 OTA on December 27. Update rollouts clearly take much longer than the 7-10 days the author suggests. 12/28/2016 Gohar Reply Awesome Nexus 6 Update Coming 12/29/2016 Jane Reply Nexus 6p no update as of 12/28. Husband’s 5x updated 2 weeks ago. 01/07/2017 Greg Stovall Reply It is now January 7, 2017, and my Nexus 5X, purchased from the Google store, still has not been offered the December 7.1.1 update. I also feel frustrated that my phone has been left out of the roll-out (despite being a Project Fi customer). I’ve done all the steps suggested by support folks (including factory data reset), but none of them have shaken loose an offer of 7.1.1. 01/12/2017 Goel Reply Finally received 3 OTAs yesterday for Nexus 5X. December security update, 7.1.1 and January fix 01/12/2017 Missmelony Reply Got my update this morning 5x 02/01/2017 P.

Both Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa could be yours. How will these two giants coexist in a single smartphone? We don’t really know, but we are psyched to find out. Yesterday on Feb 27, Lenovo’s Motorola handset division and Amazon revealed at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that they will be partnering up to install the Alexa voice assistant into the new line of Moto Z smartphones that will be available later this year. This is really interesting because Motos run on the Android OS, which comes with Google’s Voice Assistant that is really robust. So why would you need another voice assistant? Furthermore, Motos run basic stock Android builds, there’s nothing more Android than a Moto (apart from the Google Pixel). We concede that Amazon’s smart-device Alexa seems to be all the rage nowadays, being an awesome assistant to answer questions and direct traffic since 2 years back. It will be quite easy to implement Alexa into Moto smartphones, because Android is an open-source system, so Google’s Assistant can be easily replaced with Alexa. From the beginning of this project, Lenovo and Amazon will focus on developing something called an Alexa Mod, which is a block that will attach directly to a Moto Z handset. These companies will then integrate Alexa straight into a list of Moto handsets and devices. This Mod will let users to perform daily tasks, such as texting, checking email, scrolling through the news, controlling a smart home device, call for an Uber amongst many others.

As much as Amazon's (AMZN)  Echo home speaker/voice assistant has turned into a surprise hit and yielded a blizzard of positive media attention, the Alexa voice assistant powering Echo hardware is still in key respects at a strategic disadvantage relative to Alphabet/Google (GOOGL) , Apple (AAPL) , and Microsoft's (MSFT)  rival offerings. Google and Apple's assistants each shipped with hundreds of millions of mobile devices last year, and Microsoft's perhaps on close to 200 million PCs. By contrast, Echo sales (judging by estimates) were likely only in seven figures. In theory, that would leave Google/Apple much better-positioned to create powerful third-party ecosystems for their assistants, as well as to optimize them in response to user voice commands. In practice, Amazon's all-out push to both improve Alexa and place it within as many devices as possible is making for a very interesting battle. Earlier this week, Lenovo's Motorola Mobility unit announced it plans to bundle Alexa with "most" of its phones going forward. Since then, Re/code has reported Amazon plans to launch one or two Alexa devices this year that will "allow people to initiate phone calls by voice," as well as let multiple devices function as a home or office's intercom system. And Amazon hardware news site AFTVnews has come across an image on Amazon's site that suggests the company plans to launch a home security camera with Alexa built in. All of this comes less than two months after dozens of Alexa-powered devices were shown off at CES by companies not named Amazon. These included Alexa-powered speakers, robots, refrigerators, TV sets and alarm clocks, as well as a Huawei Android phone. In addition, dozens of home electronics and appliance makers announced that their latest products can be controlled via Alexa. That last fact underscores how successful Amazon has been at creating a giant hardware, app and Internet service ecosystem for Alexa. At CES, Amazon announced Alexa now supports over 7,000 third-party "skills," up from just 1,000 last June. They cover everything from playing games to ordering Uber rides and Domino's pizzas to controlling home lights and thermostats to hearing sports scores and news stories. Google and Apple have taken a slower approach to building out their voice assistant ecosystems. Some Android developers have taken advantage of Google's Voice Interactions API, which launched in 2015 and lets users issue voice commands for third-party Android apps. And in December, Google Assistant, the next-gen service that evolved from the older Google Now, was opened up to developers. But currently, developers can only support interactions with the Google Home speaker. Android phone support will arrive later. Apple finally opened up Siri to developers last June, after having previously integrated the assistant with a handful of third-party apps. But for now, only six types of apps -- calling, messaging, payments, photo, workout and ride-hailing apps -- are supported. Apple has also seen a measure of adoption for its HomeKit platform, which launched in 2014 and allows smart home devices to be controlled via Siri commands. However, launches of Alexa-capable smart home products have been outpacing those of HomeKit-capable products, thanks in no small part to the fact that Apple places much stricter requirements on hardware partners than does Amazon. Amazon, meanwhile, seems intent on spending and partnering its way to success. Last May, Jeff Bezos said Amazon had over 1,000 people working on Alexa and the Echo line. A LinkedIn job search for "Amazon Alexa" currently turns up 896 openings at Amazon and a pair of subsidiaries. A search for "Amazon artificial intelligence" turns up 157 openings at the company, including many for Alexa units. That said, Google still appears to be a very formidable rival. In addition to being able to bundle Assistant with the world's most popular mobile operating system, the company's ability to integrate Assistant with Google Search and its massive Knowledge Graph, as well as with other Google services such as Maps and Gmail, is a valuable advantage. So are its tremendous AI investments, which help with things like maintaining a conversation with a user and understanding the meaning of natural-language commands. Apple, on the other hand, might be in a tougher spot. While Siri is guaranteed to maintain a large user base as long as it remains built into Apple hardware, even many Apple fans have been complaining it has been falling behind its rivals in both accuracy and functionality. And unlike Alexa or Google Assistant, it's unlikely that Siri will be baked into third-party smart home devices, given Apple's product philosophy. The stakes in this battle are pretty high, as more and more consumers warm to voice as a computing interface. Though they'll never fully replace the use of touchscreens, keyboards and mice, the enhancements (via AI algorithms and other means) made to voice search and assistant platforms as they take in more user data, along with their growing usefulness as more products and services join an ecosystem, is clearly producing a sea change. In May, Google disclosed a fifth of all the searches it handled via its mobile app and Android devices involved voice. For Google, the rise of voice presents some monetization challenges, since it can lower the number of times a user making a query sees the text-based search ads that remain by far Google's biggest profit engine. But the company is clearly better off embracing the trend with a service that integrates Google Search -- and in many cases turns up a search results page to go with a voice reply -- rather than ceding the space to rival services. Google, for its part, argues that a lot of voice search activity complements rather than cannibalizes text-based searches, and thus expands its addressable market. Amazon, meanwhile, benefits from Alexa's growing popularity both via hardware sales and the integration of its e-commerce and digital content services with the platform. Indeed, it might be a little too easy to place an Amazon order via Alexa. In addition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) powers many third-party Alexa Skills through its AWS Lambda service, though it's also possible for developers to use another cloud provider. Given what we've seen over the first couple months of the year, it's likely many more home and mobile devices featuring Alexa will be unveiled over the next 10. It's also likely that makers of smart home products will start to treat Alexa integration as no-brainer, and that the number of total skills supported by the platform will surge past 10,000. This is a battle where Amazon, ironically, has been more of a plucky upstart than an entrenched giant. But it can no longer be considered much of an underdog.

Google’s note-taking app Keep joins G Suite, now integrates with Google Docs Posted Feb 28, 2017 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story BMW says ‘nein’ to Android Auto Google Keep, a competitor to note-taking apps like Evernote and Microsoft’s OneNote, is today being integrated into Google’s suite of applications aimed at businesses, G Suite (previously, Google Apps for Your Domain). This allows Keep to become a part of users’ workflow for capturing ideas, jotting down quick reminders or to-dos, creating checklists, taking meeting notes and more. Along with its addition to G Suite, Google Keep is also now being integrated with Google Docs. That means you’ll be able to drag and drop notes from Keep into your work documents, Google explains. This feature is available via the web only, and requires you first have Docs loaded and open in your browser. Then, you’ll access the Keep notepad from the Tools menu, which places your Keep notes into a sidebar within the Docs user interface. From there, you’ll be able to grab the notes, including images and checklists, and pull them right into your document. In addition, you’re able to search your Keep notes from Google Docs, as well as add a new note to Keep while you’re working in Docs. To accomplish this latter task, you’ll select the text in your document, then right-click on the selection and choose “Save to Keep notepad.” What’s clever about this integration is that the note also will include a link back to the source document when it’s added this way. The move to expand Keep beyond its consumer user base makes sense, given that many business, government and education users may have already been using the app on their own. As a part of G Suite, those business-focused notes can now be kept securely within the company’s own domain, where they can be managed, supported and made searchable. Keep is available to G Suite customers as of today, where it can be used on Android, iOS, Chrome or web. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Keep Description Google Keep is an app that lets you easily create notes on the go.

Image Credit: Drew Tarvin/Flickr Google today enhanced its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) public cloud infrastructure offering with new virtual machine (VM) instances that boast up to 64 virtual central processing unit (CPU) cores, effectively providing more computing power for applications. They’re available now in beta for all users and projects out of Google’s data center zones that run Intel’s Haswell and Broadwell chips. There are three available flavors in the Google Compute Engine (GCE): a standard instance called n1-standard-64, a high-memory instance called n1-highmem-64, and an instance with high CPU-to-memory ratio called n1-highcpu-64. They’re all available from Google’s web-based Cloud Console and in the command-line interface (CLI) with the Google Cloud SDK. Google has been taking many steps to become more competitive with other public clouds. The biggest one, Amazon Web Services (AWS), does offer machines with 64 vCPUs. There are even 128 vCPU machines available from AWS. Currently, Microsoft Azure, the second biggest cloud, does not have machines with more than 32 vCPUs. Google followed AWS and Azure and introduced a key management service in January. People with free trials will need to ask for a quota increase in order to spin up one of the new instances — if you try to create one with a free trial, you’ll receive an error saying you’ve reached a limit of 24 CPUs. “We’ll improve the way quotas work in the near future so that it will be possible to create a 32-core instance for new, free trial users, a Google spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. Google’s prowess in getting big customers for its cloud was proven last month, when Snap, the newly public company behind Snapchat, revealed that it had a $2 billion contract with the Google Cloud.

The city’s councilors are to cast final votes on the plan March 7. With a considerable degree of understatement, Google’s project consultants described the colossal main structure on the campus as “a building form not typically described in standard city codes.” Indeed, it’s a building form not typically found outside science fiction. With two levels rising above a massive basement containing a utility plant, the 595,000-square-foot structure would boast a scalloped canopy roof tiled with solar panels and inset with skylight-windows. Artist’s rendering of Google’s proposed Charleston East campus (City of Mountain View) At its highest point, the building, between Amphitheatre Parkway and Charleston Road in Mountain View’s North Bayshore area, would be about 112 feet tall. While there’s no shortage in the artist’s renderings of happy, shiny, Googley young folks, the images show humans not typically well represented at Google: children and old people. That’s because the 18.7-acre campus features areas open to the public, including a park, a plaza and, on the ground floor of the main building, various pavilions, plus public amenities along an interior path or “artery.” “Cafes and shops dot the artery to create a bustling social and retail destination open to both Googlers and the wider public,” the planning documents said. “Smaller meandering paths between the pavilions provide quieter and more intimate spaces for collaboration and private conversation.” Artist’s rendering of Google’s proposed Charleston East campus (City of Mountain View) Also planned is a sculpture garden, with art “more like ‘Burning Man’ installations and less like ‘do not touch’ museum installations,” according to the planning documents. A “green loop” with “savanna-like habitat” would connect the campus to the nearby Googleplex campus, through Charleston Park. Artist’s rendering of Google’s proposed Charleston East campus (City of Mountain View) To help prevent deaths of birds from hitting windows, an ornithologist was brought in, and glass will be used that is neither highly reflective nor perfectly transparent, as windows with those characteristics can contribute to avian fatalities. Construction is expected to take 2 1/2 years and would start after Google received approval for the campus from Mountain View city council, and a building permit.   Image: Artist’s rendering of Google’s proposed Charleston East campus (City of Mountain View) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: campus, Charleston East, city council, Google, Mountain View, photos, plans   More Posts in Big Tech Elon Musk, Tim Cook top Page, Pichai, Zuckerberg and Gates as ‘visionaries’ in survey of tech leaders March 6, 2017   Dear Elon, I have an idea… March 2, 2017   Google spinoff Waymo vs Uber: Does Uber have a defense against claim of self-driving car secrets theft?

The company received a patent for a baseball cap with a stills-and-video camera mounted on the brim. Photos and video could be beamed via social media to a users’ friends and even allow for live interaction with another user, the patent indicated. The hat’s brim would have a receptacle to hold the removable camera. The potential for users to share photos and videos straight from the device would one-up makers of wearable cameras that store imagery for later uploads, the patent suggested. “Some cameras are designed to be attached to a helmet or another place on a person’s body for capturing video clips of events,” according to the patent. “These cameras typically record and store video clips of an event, and a person can later move the video clips onto a computer. “The (Google Hat) camera system is configured to connect, via the wireless communications module and a mobile computing device, to a social networking server.” But the technology is not just about real-time virtual socializing – the hat-mounted camera could save a user from attack, the patent indicated. It would do so by connecting a Google Hat wearer’s video feed to emergency services during a threatening situation, essentially allowing the user to show or tell a possible assailant that they’re on camera. “The user can activate an emergency situation indicator and cause the wearable camera system to transmit a video feed to an appropriate emergency handling system, potentially deterring a dangerous person near the user,” the patent said. Although Google Glass floundered to its death in the mass market over privacy concerns (the firm is still pursuing specialized applications for the technology), the Google Hat and another device patented Feb. 28 suggest the company retains faith in a broad market for wearable cameras. The just-granted patent for a “camera bracelet” provides little more than drawings, but shows a sleek device with a digital display and what appear to be two camera lenses. Much patented technology never sees the light of day, so there’s no guarantee the Google Hat or camera bracelet will ever be available for sale. However, the volume of personal data these devices could collect would certainly be a boon for Google, whose use of such information for selling targeted ads is the crux of the business model.

Woodvine on March 4th, 2017 at 5:29 PM 1 of 1 2 of 1 At least 147 U.S. tech companies now publicly oppose President Trump’s so-called Muslim travel ban, including some of the most capitalized and influential corporations in the world, such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Intel. The backlash from the tech sector began within days of January 26, when President Trump signed his executive order banning certain immigrants from entering the United States, including all Syrian refugees and anyone from seven predominantly Muslim nations. Most recently, Yahoo and Tumblr filed an amicus brief on Friday (February 17), in support of Darweesh v. Trump—one of nearly 50 court challenges to the travel ban. Seemingly, all the other 145-plus tech companies publicly opposed to the travel ban have associated themselves with the well-publicized lawsuit State of Washington and State of Minnesota v. Trump. It is this latter legal action, commonly called Washington v. Trump, which has been blocking implementation of the travel ban since February 3 and which a U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco refused to quash in a unanimous ruling on February 9. In their amicus brief, Yahoo and Tumblr neatly sum up the pro-immigration attitude of all the tech companies opposed to the Trump travel ban: “Immigrants to the U.S. bring with them immense talent and entrepreneurship that help drive the innovation economy. Yahoo was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo—two Stanford grad students, one from Taiwan and one from Louisiana—so we know firsthand that great things can happen when America welcomes the world’s best and brightest.” However, the tech companies’ arguments against the travel ban are rooted less in warm humanist virtue than in hard economic necessity. The U.S. education system, the companies say, does not produce anywhere near enough Americans with the requisite computer science skills to fill more than a fraction of U.S. tech jobs; therefore it is absolutely necessary to attract a constant influx of the world’s “best and brightest” in order for the tech sector in the United States just to survive, let alone thrive. Keep in mind that opposing a newly-elected president who is carrying out a campaign promise is not—strictly speaking—a good business move; rather it is a sure way to piss off millions of voters/consumers. I take the fact that so many tech companies (almost all of them dependent on consumer sales) have been willing to come out against Trump’s travel ban as proof of two things. That the companies see the travel ban and similar anti-immigration policies as truly threatening their survival and that they can count well enough to know that more U.S. consumers voted for Hillary Clinton (65,844,954, or 48.2 percent) than for Donald Trump (62,979,879, or 46.1 percent). President Trump keeps a divisive campaign promise In brief, U.S president Donald Trump’s travel ban–properly titled “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States”, which Trump signed on January 26 as Executive Order 13769, does the following: Permanently closes the U.S. borders to all Syrian refugees. Closes the U.S. borders for 90 days to immigrants and travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries (Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen)—including immigrants with valid U.S. visas. After 90 days the list of banned countries will be revised and perhaps even expanded. Suspends for 120 days the troubled U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Caps to 50,000 the total number of refugees allowed in the U.S in 2017. Instant legal challenges On January 30—only four days after the Executive Order was signed—Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson (later joined by the attorney general of Minnesota) was in a Seattle U.S. District Court seeking to have the executive order declared “illegal and unconstitutional”. Ferguson argued that the Muslim travel ban was both discriminatory and directly harmed the interests of the state’s residents as well as the foreign students and lecturers attending state educational institutions. On February 3, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart sided with Washington State and granted a temporary restraining order against key elements of Trump’s executive order. On February 9, a three-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, California, unanimously denied the Trump administration’s request to lift the temporary restraining order stopping the U.S. government from enforcing much of the travel ban. This effectively threw the matter back to the U.S. District Court in Seattle, Washington, where it began. On February 27, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to put a hold on the Washington v. Trump suit seeking to overturn the current travel ban, despite claims by the Trump administration that it is readying a differently formulated travel ban, intended to be immune from judicial challenge. On February 28 it was widely reported that the newly revised travel ban would drop Iraq from the list of banned countries of origin. The U.S. tech sector stands for immigration The U.S. information technology sector only needed to look at itself in a mirror to see why it had to oppose the Trump administration’s specifically Islamophobic and generally xenophobic immigration travel ban: Current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was born in Hyderabad, India. Google co-founder Sergey Brin was a refugee from the former Soviet Union. Current Google CEO Sundar Pichai was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. Twitter’s executive chairman Omid Kordestani was born in Iran. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos‘s step-dad immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba. Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was a refugee fleeing the 1978 Iranian Revolution. California entrepreneur Safi Qureshey—a practicing Muslim born in Pakistan—cofounded the (now defunct) U.S. personal computer company AST Research in 1980. And on and on. Besides the gifted foreign-born entrepreneurs and executives mentioned above (some of whom have slowly risen up through the corporate ranks), U.S. tech companies appear to be very dependent on attracting very large numbers of foreign-born computer science graduates, in order to fill positions in middle management and below. It's all thanks to a massive ongoing shortfall in skilled American computer graduates. According to several sources, including the Atlantic, there are  currently about half a million computer jobs to be filled in the U.S. tech sector. But only about 43,000 Americans graduate college annually with the required computer science degrees to fill these jobs. Meanwhile, considerably more than one million  IT engineers graduate in China and India every year, according to Newsweek. The U.S. government has been trying, in fits and starts, to grow the number of American science graduates for decades. Most recently the Obama administration tried hard but was largely unable to convince a Republican-held Congress to approve a package of programs designed to produce more college graduates in the so-called STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. Simply put, the U.S. technology companies which are opposed to Trump’s travel ban say that in lieu of a large-enough pool of sufficiently skilled Americans, they must hire skilled foreign workers. And insofar as the travel ban makes it difficult for U.S. tech companies to attract and keep the best-qualified foreign-born workers, it does real harm to the long-term prospects of the U.S. tech sector, which is a significant segment of the U.S. economy, accounting for millions of good domestic jobs and trillions of dollars of domestic spending. How the tech opposition to Trump’s travel ban evolved First off, on January 31, Amazon and Expedia (both based in Washington state) each filed declarations joining the Washington lawsuit against the travel ban. Amazon’s motion cites the travel ban’s adverse affects on both employees and prospective employees, including a Libyan-born Amazon lawyer with British citizenship, as well as 49 employees born in the seven Muslim-majority countries included in the ban. Expedia’s motion says that the ban could damage its international travel business, considering that at least 1,000 of its customers hold passports from the seven restricted countries. On February 6, 96 U.S. companies filed an amicus brief in support of the suit against the ban, including many of the heaviest hitters in tech: AdRoll • Aeris Communications • Airbnb • AltSchool • Ancestry.com • Appboy • Apple • AppNexus Inc. • Asana, Inc. • Atlassian Corp Plc • Autodesk • Automattic • Box • Brightcove • Brit + Co • CareZone • Castlight Health • Checkr • Chobani • Citrix Systems • Cloudera • Cloudflare • Copia Institute • DocuSign • DoorDash • Dropbox • Dynatrace • eBay • Engine Advocacy • Etsy • Facebook • Fastly • Flipboard • Foursquare Labs • Fuze • General Assembly • GitHub • Glassdoor • Google • GoPro • Harmonic • Hipmunk • Indiegogo • Intel Corporation • JAND, Inc. d/b/a Warby Parker • Kargo Global • Kickstarter • KIND • Knotel • Levi Strauss & Co. • LinkedIn Corporation • Lithium Technologies, Inc. • Lyft • Mapbox • Maplebear Inc. d/b/a Instacart • Marin Software Incorporated • Medallia, Inc. • A Medium Corporation • Meetup, Inc. • Microsoft Corporation • Motivate International • Mozilla Corporation • Netflix • NETGEAR • NewsCred • Patreon • PayPal Holdings, Inc. • Pinterest • Quora • Reddit • Rocket Fuel • SaaStr • Salesforce.com, Inc. • Scopely • Shutterstock • Snap • Spokeo • Spotify USA • Square • Squarespace • Strava • Stripe • SurveyMonkey • TaskRabbit • Tech:NYC • Thumbtack • Turn Inc. • Twilio • Twitter • Uber Technologies, Inc. • Via • Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. • Workday • Y Combinator Management, LLC • Yelp • Zynga.   By the evening of February 6, another 31 companies had reportedly joined the brief, including Adobe Systems, Tesla, and Space X, bringing the total to 129: Adobe Systems Incorporated • Affirm, Inc. • Ampush • Brocade Communications Systems • Bungie • Casper Sleep • Cavium • Chegg • ClassPass • Coursera • EquityZen Inc. • Evernote • Gusto • Handy Technologies • HP • IAC/InterActiveCorp • Linden Lab • Managed By Q • MobileIron • New Relic • Pandora Media • Planet Labs • RPX Corporation • Shift Technologies • Slack Technologies • SpaceX • Tesla • TripAdvisor • Udacity • Zendesk • Zenefits.   Between February 7 and 9 a minimum of 16 more companies joined the Technology Companies amicus brief, bringing the total to at least 145: Akamai Technologies, Inc. • CREDO Mobile, Inc. • DiCentral • Fitbit, Inc. • Groupon • Medidata Solutions • Molecule Software, Inc. • MongoDB, Inc. • Pivotal Software • Postmates • Redfin • Quantcast Corp. • SoundCloud, Inc. • Skycatch, Inc. • SpotHero • WHOmentors.com, Inc.   The late addition of Yahoo and Tumbler on February 17 brings the total to at least 147. The tech companies in Trump’s corner Donald Trump does have his supporters in the tech sector. Notable U.S. technology companies that have not voiced opposition to the travel ban include: AT&T • Cisco • General Electric • IBM • Oracle • Palantir Technologies • Sprint • T-Mobile • Verizon • WeWork. Notably, AT&T, Cisco, IBM, and Palantir do very little or none of their business with the general public. AT&T, in particular, dares not anger Donald Trump because it needs his administration’s approval of its huge merger with Time Warner, the owner of CNN. IBM’s CEO Ginni Rometty is a member of Trump’s business advisory council and in November 2016 wrote an open letter to president-elect Trump on the subject of creating “new collar” jobs, wherein she promised that IBM would bring 25,000 more jobs to the U.S. Oracle’s CEO Israeli-born Safra Catz was part of Trump’s transition team and Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins has gone on record as supporting Trump’s tax reform policies. Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp attended Trump’s tech summit but more to the point, the data mining software company is firmly in the Trump administration’s pocket. Palantir was cofounded by Trump supporter Peter Thiel with backing from Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture arm and counts the FBI, Pentagon, and IRS among its largest clients. And to paraphrase Intercept, Palantir is providing the engine for Donald Trump’s deportation machine. Is Trump trying to prevent terrorism or cause it? The majority of mass killing incidents in the United States have been committed by citizens born in the United States and the common thread that connects all the terrorists—domestic and foreign—from the Unabomber to Timothy McVeigh to Omar Mir Seddique Mateen to Osama Bin Laden—isn’t nationality or religion, it is the nihilistic surrender to extremism, hate, and murder. Between 1975 and 2015, nationals from five of the banned countries (two Iraqis, six Iranians, two Somalis, six Sudanese, and one Yemeni) were convicted of attempting or executing terrorist attacks on U.S. but all the same, no one from the seven banned countries killed anyone in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil during that period. None of the perpetrators of terrorist attacks in the U.S. claiming 10 or more victims were from one of the seven banned countries. The majority of attacks were committed by people born in the U.S. Over the last four decades, only 20 of 3.25 million refugees have been convicted of attempting or committing terrorism on U.S. soil. Only three Americans have been killed in attacks committed by refugees—all by Cubans in the 1970s. None of the birth countries of people who have killed people in U.S. (Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia) are affected by Trump’s travel ban. No Muslim-majority countries where the Trump Organization holds business interests, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, the U.A.E., and Azerbaijan are affected by the ban. Arguably, only someone ignorant of the actual history of terrorism in the United States could imagine that Trump’s Muslim-centric travel ban could do anything to reduce the threat of such acts on U.S. soil. However, I do not consider Trump to be unintelligent, just uncaring of the larger consequences of his self-centred actions; I see him as someone who would burn down a forest just to warm his little hands. Trump also looks to me like a man in a hurry to start something. His March 2 speech aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier wearing a flight jacket and an admiral’s cap suggests how badly he wants an excuse to dress up as the warrior—Il Duce-style; to clothe himself and his actions in the wardrobe of scoundrels and by that I mean jingoistic “love it or leave it” patriotism. I admit that it’s a terrible thing to suggest, that Trump’s travel ban may be coldly calculated to provoke the very terrorism that it speaks of thwarting; likely it’s just the simpler sort of pandering bigotry that one associates with a populist demagogue of Trump’s stripe. Either way I’m sure that its purpose doesn’t extend much beyond selfish political considerations on Trump’s part. And I agree wholeheartedly with the technology companies opposed to the travel ban that whatever comes of it will be to the expense and detriment of the United States. And you know that something’s really rotten when you find yourself in perfect accord with a bunch of avaricious corporate entities such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Intel.

But there is a bigger issue behind it: Silicon Valley ethics and employee loyalty. The Waymo lawsuit contends that a former employee, Mr Anthony Levandowski, downloaded 9.7GB of sensitive data about the company's proprietary self-driving system, in particular its main element - the LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) system, which scans the car's environment with lasers and feeds information to software that makes driving decisions. He then left Google - after drawing his multimillion-dollar bonus - and set up his own company, Otto. Within months, he sold it to Uber for US$680 million (S$954 million), enabling Uber to catch up immediately on years of research and development. In dismissing a similar claim in court - allegations that its Oculus Rift, the virtual reality device, was based on stolen technology - Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said companies often "come out of the woodwork" to scavenge pieces of high-profile tech acquisitions. But that can't be said about Waymo in the self-driving car case. Google is an Uber investor, and it would have been unlikely to sue one of its portfolio companies without thinking things through. The lawsuit appears to be based on a thorough internal investigation, and Uber says it is taking the allegations seriously. But even if Google is technically right, it likely brought on its problem itself. So do other Silicon Valley giants. Talentful, a tech recruitment company, recently analysed LinkedIn data for the employees of 15 top US tech firms, including Google, Uber, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft. Among them, Google emerged as the most prodigious poacher, hiring a total of 12,798 employees from the other firms. And that does not even include talent acquired with the start-up companies they worked for. In the Waymo lawsuit, Google describes its self-driving car project as something that was built from scratch in-house. Mr Levandowski, however, worked on autonomous vehicles long before he came to Google and before it was even interested in the industry. In 2001, he founded a start-up called 510 Systems. In 2004, using technology he had developed, Mr Levandowski made a self-driving motorcycle for a race sponsored by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency. In 2011, as a Google employee working on Street View - the map feature that shows real-life views of streets and buildings - he persuaded Google to buy 510 Systems in a deal that was never publicly announced. In fact, the start-up's employees had signed agreements not to discuss the acquisition. The little company became the foundation of the search giant's foray into mobility tech. The incentive system Google set up for employees on the autonomous car team tied their income to certain undisclosed project milestones. It ended up being so generous that, as Bloomberg recently reported, Waymo became a sizeable drag on the finances of the parent company, Alphabet. Employees were getting such big payouts that they no longer needed the jobs, and they began leaving. With their new-found financial independence, there was no need for them to tolerate big-company bureaucracy. The Silicon Valley ethos is not about rules and organisational structures. Outstanding engineers who generate breakthrough innovations are only guests at the big corporations, seduced into keeping still for a few years with lavish payments and nice working conditions. They don't, however, develop loyalty towards the sources of these goodies. Their primary goal is often to advance their technological ideas - something that is hard to square with big-company culture, even if the company is Google, with its deep insight into the techie psyche. So how does one keep talent from migrating away and valuable innovations leaking to competitors? One way is to become more litigious. A 2014 paper by Mr Martin Gango of the University of Minnesota and two collaborators shows that the more a tech employer is inclined to defend its intellectual property in court, the less likely employees working on high-value projects are to go to the competition. "By establishing reputations for intellectual property enforcement, managers can retain key knowledge workers," the researchers wrote. Google appears to be doing just that with the Waymo versus Uber case. Though such litigation is expensive and outcomes are far from assured, few engineers want to find themselves on the receiving end of big-corporation fury. But there is a flip side: If Google establishes a reputation for going after former employees, it will have a harder time attracting major talent and buying further promising start-ups. If it wants to grow more of its talent in-house, that's a trade-off worth making. But if poaching continues to be the preferred mode of operation, the litigiousness may cost Google more than one future breakthrough.

(File photo) The US Defense Department has launched an investigation into release of hundreds — possibly thousands — of naked photographs of women service members and veterans. The announcement was made after members of the Marine Corps recently posted the photos in a Facebook group called “Marines United,” with around 30,000 followers. More than two dozen women have been identified as being Marine officers and enlisted service members. The photographs, published since January 30 via a Google Drive account, have caused yet another scandal for the US military, underscoring ongoing problems of sexual harassment. "The success of every Marine, every team, every unit and command throughout our Corps is based on mutual trust and respect," Commandant Robert Neller told the Marine Corps Times. "I expect every Marine to demonstrate the highest integrity and loyalty to fellow Marines at all times, on duty, off-duty and online." The Naval Criminal Investigative Service launched an investigation into the photos as Google and Facebook blocked the accounts posting the pictures to the group. The scandal was initially reported by the Center for Investigative Reporting and was completed by the nonprofit news organization The War Horse later. “We need to be brutally honest with ourselves and each other: This behavior hurts fellow Marines, family members, and civilians. It is a direct attack on our ethos and legacy,” Sergeant Major Ronald L. Green, the most senior enlisted Marine on active duty, wrote in an email response to the Center for Investigative Reporting. “It is inconsistent with our core values, and it impedes our ability to perform our mission. According to a document provided to generals, “The story will likely spark shares and discussions across social media, offering venues for Marines and former Marines who may victim blame, i.e., ‘they shouldn’t have taken the photos in the first place,’ or bemoan that they believe the Corps is becoming soft or politically correct.” Meanwhile, Democratic Washington Representative Adam Smith, a ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, called for a complete investigation into the matter. “This behavior by Marines and former Marines is degrading, dangerous, and completely unacceptable,” said the congressman in a statement. In its annual report in 2016, the Pentagon said it received about 6,000 reports of sexual assault in 2015 alone.

Tor and the Dark Net by Gordon Summers-P2P Posted on 05.03.2017 at 22:59 in eBook, Ebooks by TheInsertus Everyone thinks they know what is out there on the Internet. They have a Facebook account, their Gmail is pushed to their phone, and they make regular purchases on Ebay and Amazon. But this online world is only the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface of what gets indexed on Google there is a vast online world full of anarchists, trolls, criminals, social revolutionaries, and others who for whatever reason are looking for something beyond what is available on Google and Facebook. Welcome to the Dark Net. A place where the concept of freedom is stretched to its limit. A place where you can buy pretty much anything if you have enough Bitcoin. A decentralized world where trust is crowd-sourced and government is irrelevant. People are attracted to the Dark Net for a wide variety of different reasons, from drugs, sex and violence, to a desire to opt out of conventional law and order and create a new and better world. In this ground-breaking book, Gordon Summers dives deep into the furthest reaches of the Dark Net to explore what goes on in an online world most have never accessed or even heard of. What he has found will shock you, entertain you, and maybe even scare you.

This week, the search giant is taking its lumps. First: BuzzFeed explained how Alphabet-owned YouTube became the “engine” of false conspiracy theories like Pizzagate. Strike one. Second: SearchEngineLand editor Danny Sullivan noticed that Google was passing off right-wing paranoia as the promoted answer to questions like, “Is Obama planning a coup?” and, “Is Obama planning martial law?” Strike two. If you're wondering if Obama is planning a coup, Google's "one true answer" is yes.

It stands for “for fuck’s sake.”) Those bogus search results are also served up as fact on Google’s virtual assistant, Google Home. Unlike a normal page of search results, Google Home doesn’t tell you where its answer came from or give you the option to see other answers.

Identity Crisis Comes To An End ! by Meghdeep PatnaikMarch 3, 2017 2 Now Reading Moto Or Motorola ? Identity Crisis Comes To An End ! Browse This Page Article Rating Comments Share on Facebook Share on Twitter In 2014, Lenovo acquired Motorola from then owner, Google. Lenovo, in 2016, decided to roll out Motorola phones with the name “Moto By Lenovo”. After almost an year of this decision, Lenovo is planning to re-introduce the brand “Motorola”, putting an end to its identity crisis. In conversation with CNET during the Mobile World Congress 2017, Chairman and President of Motorola, Aymar de Lencquesaing mentioned the reason behind their decision to reintroduce the “Motorola” brand. de Lencquesaing said, “In 2016, we just finished transforming ourselves. We now have clarity on how we present ourselves”. The Motorola brand will be first re-introduced in the United States, since it was Motorola’s primary smartphone market when it was owned by Google. However, De Lencquesaing has also said that the brand name will be re-introduced in other countries too, one of which is China. The original Motorola “bat wing” icon will be back on the smartphones and hopefully the customer base of the Lenovo smartphones will go up with this inclusion. With time, Lenovo will re-introduce the Motorola brand in other regions too. De Lencquesaing further added that the timeline of phasing in of the Motorola brand will depend on the market situation. He emphasized that the process will be a gradual shift and won’t happen overnight. The Mobile World Congress 2017, which recently concluded, saw the launch of two “Moto By Lenovo” smartphones – Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus. The two phones are expected to release Mid-March in India. likethis What's your reaction?

Spandas Lui Mar 6, 2017, 7:30am ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories killer interview questions kiq Share Image: iStock This week's KIQ comes from Google's former senior marketing manager Heidi Zak who asks every job candidate this question. Zak is now the manager and co-founder of online bra company ThirdLove. The company was founded in 2013 and now has over 50 staff. Curiosity is what she values most in an employee. To gauge a job applicant's level of curiosity, Zak would ask this question: One year from now, if you’re part of the team at ThirdLove, how will you judge if [your time here] has been a success? Like many of the KIQs we've featured, there isn't really a set answer to this question but the ideal answer would include something along the lines of: "It's all about learning new things and about growing professionally." How would you tackle this question? Let us know in the comments.

I've heard that smoking cigarettes can age you prematurely. However, judging by the before-and-after photos I've seen, most of these people were pretty rough to begin with!

It kicked off with a highly publicized blog posting from former engineer Susan Fowler describing intrinsic sexual harassment at the San Francisco-based ride-hailing service. This was followed by an open letter from two of its investors condemning the company for fostering poor corporate behavior and unhealthy business practices. This, of course, was fast followed by a lawsuit from Google-parent Alphabet’s Waymo that alleged Uber stole some of its driverless car technology. That was last week. This week saw Uber CEO Travis Kalanick asking his senior vice president of engineering, Amit Singhal, to step down after it came to light that Singhal had neglected to reveal that he was the subject of an ongoing sexual harassment investigation at his previous employer Google. However, Kalanick ended up being the subject of his own controversy just a few days later.  A remorseful Kalanick issued a public apology to his employees at Uber after a video surfaced on Bloomberg in which he had a heated exchange with one of his own drivers regarding declining fares. “My job as your leader is to lead,” Kalanick wrote. “That is not what I did, and it cannot be explained away. It’s clear this video is a reflection of me — and the criticism we’ve received is a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up. This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.” As if that were not enough bad publicity for the company, vice president of product growth Ed Baker left Uber after three years at the company amid the growing scrutiny of the company’s business practices and claimed toxic culture. Meanwhile, Fowler said on Thursday that she had obtained legal council while accusing her former employer of investigating her unfairly over a string of Uber app deletions. The final blow came from a New York Times report that alleged Uber had been using a program, internally called Greyball, to circumvent authorities in markets where its ride-haling services were resisted or outright banned. Having been in place since 2014, the program uses data collected to avoid suspect hailers on a global scale. In a statement, Uber claimed, “This program denies ride requests to users who are violating our terms of service — whether that’s people aiming to physically harm drivers, competitors looking to disrupt our operations, or opponents who collude with officials on secret ‘stings’ meant to entrap drivers.” [Image: Jason Tester Guerrilla Futures/Flickr (CC BY-ND 2.0)] Posted in Industry, News Blog Tagged as Industry, legal action, ride-hailing, Technology, Travis Kalanick, uber Tweet Print More Reviews < Previous Post"The Fiat 500e is North America’s New Cheapest Car" Next Post >"Junkyard Find: 1990 Range Rover Classic" Get the latest TTAC e-Newsletter!

However, the fact that their revenues only cover half their expenditures will. How long can Uber lose billions before investors wake up to this scam? Login to reply jmo March 5th, 2017 at 6:23 pm They should reduce their growth rate and investment in the business to become profitable now? Why exactly? Login to reply stuki March 5th, 2017 at 9:20 pm They can’t. The way the world is currently rigged, if they behave “financially responsibly”, Lyft or somebody will blow them out of the water market share wise. It’s the same story across most of Silicon Valley. The time honored tradition of organic growth by reinvested earnings, has been thoroughly supplanted by growth subsidized by debasing a once prosperous middle class. All in order to ensure a politically connected “investing” class can pretend relevance way beyond what their meager abilities to create value, would otherwise have afforded them. So, as long as the Feds music is playing, Uber has no choice but to keep dancing. Whether ultimately destroying more value than they add, or not. Since as long as that music plays, any value destroyed are more than made up for by forced transfers from the social classes less connected than the “investing” one. Login to reply carguy March 6th, 2017 at 2:23 pm @jmo: Are you asking me why a company should stop losing $2-3 billion dollars of their investors money each year? Login to reply notapreppie March 6th, 2017 at 8:42 am I was under the impression (and I can’t remember where I read it) that Uber was using VC money to subsidize fares by as much as 30% as a tactic to drive down competition. (No pun intended.) Login to reply OldManPants March 5th, 2017 at 4:34 pm My only interest in the Uber debacle is that Kalanick confirms something my Mom always said to me. Your face really *can* freeze that way. Login to reply orenwolf March 5th, 2017 at 7:01 pm This is going to be the moment that Uber either descends into chaos or coalesces around better leadership and new direction. It’s also the time that competitors will be sitting up and paying attention. Both outcomes are a net positive: if Uber fractures, competition will have an opportunity to step in and enjoy second mover advantage from the groundwork they’ve laid. If they get new leadership and direction, then we may finally see a company worth the hype. Login to reply stuki March 5th, 2017 at 9:44 pm When you operate in an environment where the rules have yet to be either built at all, or has at least not been tested for basic sanity even if they have been built; a general attitude of better beg forgiveness than ask permission, is a good trait for management to have. Uber management’s responsibility is towards those using, or wishing to use, their services. Not to a bunch of self promoting, professional aggrievados whose knowledge of Uber stem more from reading sensationalist newsmedia about their frontman/men, than from personal experience with the service they provide. Most people who have tried Uber, likes it. Better than available alternatives. As long as that stays true, Uber will be OK. Like Walmart and Amazon. Two other outfits with happy customers. Who also seem to irk those whose profession is to be irked about something. As well as the latter’s hangers on, whose opinions are almost entirely arrived at by a pathological need to appear clued in, by parroting some yahoo, any yahoo, with access to a publishing outlet. In the long run, Uber will fail from investment grace because the service they provide will be commoditized. Theirs may be a tough path to initially map out, but an easy one to copy. So, in the time honored fashion of all disruptors-cum-hot-investments, their later stages will be one of trying to use the same levers of government to suppress more efficient competitors, as the current incumbents are using to suppress them. Simply because the ideal, most efficient solution to the problem Uber is trying to solve, is unregulated pirate taxis. And in that game, the drivers and passengers have very little reason to cut some middle man in for more than the tiniest share. Not even close to enough to make Uber’s current valuation sustainable. Login to reply Flybrian March 5th, 2017 at 7:39 pm Know what’s funny? Most taxi companies STILL haven’t adopted Uber’s most appealing concepts like real-time ride tracking, cashless payment, honest routing, and generally higher standards in their motor pool. Login to reply stuki March 5th, 2017 at 9:56 pm Their business model is not to beat the competition on features. Hence they see no reason to spend money on that. Instead, their model is to harass the complication out of existence. Hence, the money Uber spends on features, the Taxi rackets spend on lawyers and lobbyists. As well as on hacks who write cheesy stories about how many “mean” words some Uber employee used, in a tweet about something. Something that is inevitably utterly and entirely irrelevant, for anyone whose goal is just to get from A to B efficiently by hiring a ride. Login to reply notapreppie March 6th, 2017 at 8:44 am On a side note: it’s city ordinance in Chicago that fares have the right to pay by credit card. It’s been that way for a while but has only reached 90%+ adoption in the last few years. I’ve had a few free cab rides because the cab didn’t have a working CC swiper. Login to reply 87 Morgan March 6th, 2017 at 8:59 am 90% adoption of cashless payment. This drives me nuts. I travel weekly for work. I carry enough cash for tips etc, not enough to pay for taxi fares. Nothing is more frustrating than getting in a cab to find out they only take cash. As a side note, I am the worst guy ever to mug. If you ask nicely I will just give you the $15 in my wallet, no need for anyone to get hurt or commit a felony. Login to reply Flybrian March 6th, 2017 at 5:48 pm 4824 Alt 19, Palm Harbor, FL 34683.

Login to reply mopar4wd March 6th, 2017 at 9:05 am Uber should fail. I mean the economics of it are awful to start. But also they way they approached changing regulation should have never happened. They started working the edges and using loopholes which is great, but then they switched to outright breaking laws until the laws changed to benefit them more then their competitors (Taxi’s). We are a country of laws, they should have been shut down when they started running Uber X in NYC, instead they got the best possible outcome light regulation on them while maintaining heavy regulations on Taxi’s. If the law was changed to allow Uber x then the same laws should have allowed for Taxis to be regulated in the same way. Uber is essentially the worst possible example of crony capitalism in the history of the US. Login to reply skor March 6th, 2017 at 9:26 am Bottom Line Uber’s real problem is this: Too many driver’s chasing too few fares. There is a reason that NYC enacted a taxi medallion scheme in the 1930s. Login to reply Flipper35 March 6th, 2017 at 9:39 am Long ago I would have been interested in using Uber but after their policy change after the incident in Chicago I no longer have any interest in giving them money. Login to reply pdieten March 6th, 2017 at 10:26 am The idea that taxi service is a stupid industry in desperate need of disruption, and the idea that Uber is a den of flagrant jerks who profoundly deserve all the bad things that happen to them, are not mutually exclusive. Both of those things can be true at the same time. Login to reply OldManPants March 6th, 2017 at 2:50 pm Astute realism ain’t gonna get you nowhere in showbiz. Login to reply DC Bruce March 6th, 2017 at 5:42 pm Washington DC used to have some of the worst taxicabs ever. No meters, just “zones” which even a 37-year resident like I am could never figure out. And, of course, the zones do not extend to any of the 3 DC area airports. Most of the vehicles were clapped-out Panthers, purchased after a hard life in police duty, with busted seats, busted shock absorbers and oil-smoke spewing exhausts. And the drivers almost all “just off the boat” who knew only how to get from the major airports and the major downtown hotels. Unlike some other cities, e.g. NYC, there was no “medallion” system and no legal monopoly. So, I was an early adopter of Uber. They usually under-priced the cabs, you didn’t have to deal with cash and they were dependable. (I had quite a few instances of cabs failing to show for early-morning pickups at my house to the airport.) That said, I’m not insensitive to the plight of their drivers. I have a feeling that a lot of them who signed up early on and maybe even purchased a vehicle based on the expectation of a certain amount of revenue are getting squeezed as Uber ratchets the prices down to compete with Lyft. Like a franchisor that won’t commit to a maximum number of franchised stores in a given territory, Uber’s interests and it’s drivers’ interests are not aligned.

By Michael Havis / Published 5th March 2017 GETTY/GOOGLE NUCLEAR POWERED: The HMS Trafalgar, left, and the Porthmadog shop where the plans were donated Staff at a Barnardo’s store in Wales were stunned to find the plans in an anonymously-donated suitcase. The case was filled with books, but also contained the plans for the former nuclear submarine, the HMS Trafalgar. Manager Stella Parker took the plans for valuation to David Dickinson's Real Deal TV show when it visited Porthmadog in Gwynedd. DAILY POST WALES SHOCKED: Stella Parker couldn't believe she found the nuclear submarine plans “When I found it I just thought, wow, this is amazing” Stella Parker, Barnardo's She was told by experts that the plans were likely posted on the sub to familiarise new crew members with its layout. The document could also have come from from Vickers, who built the HMS Trafalgar, or the submarine's designers. Now the shop will auction off the plans of the sub, which was launched in 1981 and decommissioned in 2009. "I can only imagine the family of someone who had passed away donated the suitcase," said Mrs Parker.

We are all very excited here about it." Quoted by the BBC, Mrs Parker said Barnardo’s hoped to raise "as much money as we can" with the sale. The HMS Trafalgar used to lurk under the frozen polar icecaps, keeping the threat of the then-Soviet Union at bay. It also served in Afghanistan and was the first Royal Navy submarine to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles at Taliban forces.

Brown Jr. Yesterday, The Center for Investigative Reporting published a report that revealed that the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) has launched an investigation into hundreds of Marines following the discovery of a secret Facebook group that was used to spread naked pictures of service women. The report, authored by Thomas Brennan, founder of a nonprofit news organization called The War Horse, revealed that pictures of the service women were shared on a private Facebook group called Marines United, either posted to the site itself, or via links to a Google Drive folder. The group consists of nearly 30,000 members, some of whom posted comments on the images. The group was originally founded in 2015, and open to male members of the US Marine Corps, Navy Corpsmen, and the British Royal Marines. According to a description from a retired Marine on Reddit, the group has a history with this type of content, with a “vast majority of the posted items were pictures of girls posts without permission, revenge porn, creepy stalker-like photos taken of girls in public, talk about rape, racist comments and just straight bullshit.” Posts attracted thousands of comments, urging users to post additional photographs Brennan’s report outlined that the images or links posted to the group, attracted over 2,500 comments, some of which urged users to upload additional images. In some cases, the explicit images were also accompanied by information on their subjects, identifying more than two dozen female service members by their names, ranks, duty stations, and branches. While some images were reportedly taken illicitly, others appeared to have been stolen from private accounts. In January, the Marine Corps assigned its first female Marines to Infantry roles, over a year after former Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced that combat jobs would be open to female service members across the armed forces. According to Brennan, the pictures began circulating a month after the placement of those service women, and that the military launched an investigation upon being contacted for comment. The investigation is “in support of two individuals affected by postings on the Marines United site,” while legal and other resources will be provided to assist other affected individuals. Brennan reports that at least one Marine who shot illicit photographs has been discharged from Active Duty, while “hundreds of Marines” are currently being investigated. A veteran who was responsible for first posting a link to the photos on Google Drive was fired from his position as a government contractor. Some of the social media accounts and Google Drive folders responsible for sharing the images have been deleted. Google declined to comment on the issue. Following the publication of the report, Brennan, a Marine Corps veteran, and his family have received threats. “There's a "bounty on pictures of my daughter,” Brennan told the Marine Corps Times. “It has been suggested that my wife should be raped as a result of this, and people are openly suggesting I should be killed. ... Can you imagine being one of the victims?" “The Marine Corps is deeply concerned about allegations regarding the derogatory online comments and sharing of salacious photographs in a closed website.” Reached by email, Captain Ryan E. Alvis of the Office of Marine Corps Communications told The Verge that she would not comment directly on the investigation, but noted that "the Marine Corps is deeply concerned about allegations regarding the derogatory online comments and sharing of salacious photographs in a closed website. This behavior destroys morale, erodes trust, and degrades the individual,” and that the Marine Corps is taking the allegations seriously. She pointed to Article 133 (for officers) or Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which specifically prohibits the sharing of images without a user’s consent, and that violations might be met with criminal investigation or administrative action. General Robert Neller, the Commandant of the Marine Corps issued a statement: I am not going to comment specifically about an on-going investigation, but I will say this: For anyone to target one of our Marines, online or otherwise, in an inappropriate manner, is distasteful and shows an absence of respect. The success of every Marine, every team, every unit and command throughout our Corps is based on mutual trust and respect. I expect every Marine to demonstrate the highest integrity and loyalty to fellow Marines at all times, on duty, off-duty, and online. I expect Marines to give their all to be the best human beings, teammates, and Marines possible. Requests for comment from Facebook and Google were not returned before publication. We’ll update this post if we hear back. The United States Armed Forces have been forced to contend with sexism in its ranks and in its service academies as women are integrated into combat positions. One female Marine, who spoke to The Verge on the condition of anonymity, noted that while she did not believe that she was directly impacted by this specific incident, she had been personally affected “by this type of thing.” Update March 6th, 7:53AM ET: Updated to add word from the Marine Corps Times.

Availability: 4-5 years by Russ Juskalian One of the labs at QuTech, a Dutch research institute, is responsible for some of the world’s most advanced work on quantum computing, but it looks like an HVAC testing facility. Tucked away in a quiet corner of the applied sciences building at Delft University of Technology, the space is devoid of people. Buzzing with resonant waves as if occupied by a swarm of electric katydids, it is cluttered by tangles of insulated tubes, wires, and control hardware erupting from big blue cylinders on three and four legs. Inside the blue cylinders—essentially supercharged refrigerators—spooky quantum-mechanical things are happening where nanowires, semiconductors, and superconductors meet at just a hair above absolute zero. It’s here, down at the limits of physics, that solid materials give rise to so-called quasiparticles, whose unusual behavior gives them the potential to serve as the key components of quantum computers. And this lab in particular has taken big steps toward finally bringing those computers to fruition. In a few years they could rewrite encryption, materials science, pharmaceutical research, and artificial intelligence. This story is part of our March/April 2017 Issue See the rest of the issue Subscribe Every year quantum computing comes up as a candidate for this Breakthrough Technologies list, and every year we reach the same conclusion: not yet. Indeed, for years qubits and quantum computers existed mainly on paper, or in fragile experiments to determine their feasibility. (The Canadian company D-Wave Systems has been selling machines it calls quantum computers for a while, using a specialized technology called quantum annealing. The approach, skeptics say, is at best applicable to a very constrained set of computations and might offer no speed advantage over classical systems.) This year, however, a raft of previously theoretical designs are actually being built. Also new this year is the increased availability of corporate funding—from Google, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft, among others—for both research and the development of assorted technologies needed to actually build a working machine: microelectronics, complex circuits, and control software. The project at Delft, led by Leo Kouwenhoven, a professor who was recently hired by Microsoft, aims to overcome one of the most long-standing obstacles to building quantum computers: the fact that qubits, the basic units of quantum information, are extremely susceptible to noise and therefore error. For qubits to be useful, they must achieve both quantum superposition (a property something like being in two physical states simultaneously) and entanglement (a phenomenon where pairs of qubits are linked so that what happens to one can instantly affect the other, even when they’re physically separated). These delicate conditions are easily upset by the slightest disturbance, like vibrations or fluctuating electric fields. This blue refrigerator gets down to just above absolute zero, making quantum experiments possible on tiny chips deep inside it. In subsequent photos are scenes from the Delft lab where the experiments are prepared. People have long wrestled with this problem in efforts to build quantum computers, which could make it possible to solve problems so complex they exceed the reach of today’s best computers. But now Kouwenhoven and his colleagues believe the qubits they are creating could eventually be inherently protected—as stable as knots in a rope. “Despite deforming the rope, pulling on it, whatever,” says Kouwenhoven, the knots remain and “you don’t change the information.” Such stability would allow researchers to scale up quantum computers by substantially reducing the computational power required for error correction. Kouwenhoven’s work relies on manipulating unique quasiparticles that weren’t even discovered until 2012. And it’s just one of several impressive steps being taken. In the same lab, Lieven Vandersypen, backed by Intel, is showing how quantum circuits can be manufactured on traditional silicon wafers. What Is a Quantum Computer? At the heart of quantum computing is the quantum bit, or qubit, a basic unit of information analogous to the 0s and 1s represented by transistors in your computer. Qubits have much more power than classical bits because of two unique properties: they can represent both 1 and 0 at the same time, and they can affect other qubits via a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. That lets quantum computers take shortcuts to the right answers in certain types of calculations. Quantum computers will be particularly suited to factoring large numbers (making it easy to crack many of today’s encryption techniques and probably providing uncrackable replacements), solving complex optimization problems, and executing machine-learning algorithms. And there will be applications nobody has yet envisioned. Practical Quantum Computers Breakthrough The fabrication of stable qubits, the basic unit of quantum computers. Why it Matters Quantum computers could be exponentially faster at running artificial-intelligence programs and handling complex simulations and scheduling problems. They could even create uncrackable encryption. Key Players - QuTech - Intel - Microsoft - Google - IBM Availability 4-5 years Soon, however, we might have a better idea of what they can do. Until now, researchers have built fully programmable five-qubit computers and more fragile 10- to 20-qubit test systems. Neither kind of machine is capable of much. But the head of Google’s quantum computing effort, Harmut Neven, says his team is on target to build a 49-qubit system by as soon as a year from now. The target of around 50 qubits isn’t an arbitrary one. It’s a threshold, known as quantum supremacy, beyond which no classical supercomputer would be capable of handling the exponential growth in memory and communications bandwidth needed to simulate its quantum counterpart. In other words, the top supercomputer systems can currently do all the same things that five- to 20-qubit quantum computers can, but at around 50 qubits this becomes physically impossible. All the academic and corporate quantum researchers I spoke with agreed that somewhere between 30 and 100 qubits—particularly qubits stable enough to perform a wide range of computations for longer durations—is where quantum computers start to have commercial value. And as soon as two to five years from now, such systems are likely to be for sale. Eventually, expect 100,000-qubit systems, which will disrupt the materials, chemistry, and drug industries by making accurate molecular-scale models possible for the discovery of new materials and drugs. And a million-physical-qubit system, whose general computing applications are still difficult to even fathom? It’s conceivable, says Neven, “on the inside of 10 years.” Tech Obsessive?

Companies with the best reputations, such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Tesla, often benefit significantly from word of mouth about the quality of their products. With strong sales and healthy profits, these companies can spend more on customer service, product quality and employee satisfaction, creating a positive feedback loop that can boost reputation in the long term. The Harris Poll Reputation Quotient measures public opinion on the nation’s most recognizable companies. Respondents were asked to rate companies based on six components: emotional appeal, products and services, vision and leadership, workplace environment, social responsibility, and financial performance. 24/7 Wall St. recently reviewed the companies with the highest and lowest reputation quotients. The reputation of e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) remains the best among the nation’s 100 most recognizable companies: 1. Amazon.com > 2017 reputation score: 86.27 > 2016 reputation score: 83.96 > Industry: Internet retail > CEO: Jeff Bezos Of the six dimensions of corporate reputation, Amazon outshines all other companies in financial performance, vision and leadership, products and services, and emotional appeal. One reason behind Amazon’s widespread emotional appeal may be the company’s customer service. For as long as ACSI has ranked Amazon, the company has had one of the highest customer satisfaction scores of any U.S. business. The company’s innovations in online retail have also likely contributed to its great reputation. Between 1-click ordering, Amazon Prime, and various experimental redesigns of the traditional brick-and-mortar store concept, the company has been behind some of the boldest innovations in retail in recent years. Amazon Studios also made history recently by winning three Academy Awards at this year’s Oscars — a first for online streaming studios. Grocery store operator Wegmans was a close second on the list. Others in the top 10 included Apple and Google. Furthermore, Seattle is one of the U.S. cities with the most high-tech jobs, due in part to Amazon being headquartered there. In another recent 24/7 Wall St. analysis, Amazon was one of the most innovative companies. To determine America’s most and least reputable companies, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed reputation scores among the nation’s 100 most recognizable companies from the 2017 Harris Poll Reputation Quotient (RQ), produced by Harris Interactive. In addition, we considered company consumer satisfaction scores from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) and company information from SEC filings. For the full methodology and to see the other companies with the best and worst reputations, see the complete 24/7 Wall St. analysis.

About five years ago, I’d had enough with Comcast. They had wronged me in some way, yet again, and it was the last straw. Around the same time, DirecTV sent us some enticing offer in the mail, so I signed up with them, and enjoyed roughly the same bunch of channels for much less money (and a far worse internet connection) for the next 12 months. Then, as you might have guessed (and I surely should have), our rate nearly tripled, from about $30 a month to $80 a month. It was hidden somewhere in the two-year contract we’d signed, though to be honest I never found the actual price mentioned anywhere — just that we’d have to pay the “current rate” after 12 months were up, a price that was impossible to track down. We were forced to pay about $300 (!) just to break our contract, but after running the numbers — 11 more months at $80 each = $880 — it was still worth it. Suffice it to say, I hate DirecTV even more than I hate Comcast (for whom I still hold considerable loathing). But the point of the story is this: Since that day, we’ve been blissfully pay-TV free, and I don’t regret it for a minute. Here’s how we cut the cord, and how much money we’ve saved to date. Our Cord Cutting Setup A digital, high-definition antenna is the core building block of any good cord cutting setup. This will allow you to watch live TV over the air in crisp HD, completely free. We got ours off Amazon for about $25, and it works great for us – though we’re only about eight miles from most broadcasters. We receive dozens of channels, including the major networks like ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, and PBS, but also smaller channels showing old movies, reruns, game shows, Spanish-language TV… you name it. An HD antenna means you can watch a lot of the big live events you might fear missing out on: The Oscars, the Super Bowl, local NFL games… all of these are typically broadcast on network TV. In addition to that, we stream a lot of programming using Netflix, Amazon, and various apps. We use a Google Chromecast – a small device that plugs into the back of your TV – to simplify this process, and of course we need to pay for internet service. We’re able to watch a ton of great kid’s shows — like Wild Kratts, Nature Cat, Curious George, Peg + Cat, WordGirl, and many others — on demand, for free (and without ads for expensive plastic junk) using the PBS Kids app. When my daughter craves an episode of Dora the Explorer or Paw Patrol, we can stream an episode on NickJr.com or pop in one of several $5 DVDs we’ve picked up over the years. Netflix also hosts a pretty big, rotating library of kid’s programming, from animated TV series to older Disney movies. One lesser known reason cord cutting saves people money is that, beyond a minor one-time investment, you don’t need any other equipment to stream video in HD. Meanwhile, American cable consumers pay an average of $231 a year, every year, just to rent set-top boxes and HD receivers from their cable company. We’re paying them for the ability to watch the stuff we’ve already paid for. What Does It Cost? Obviously, this whole setup requires some basic hardware and, critically, good internet service. The latter is the biggest expense, but it’s one we’d have to pay anyway since I work from home and, well, we live in the 21st century and all that. Here’s a breakdown of the initial and ongoing costs we’ve incurred by cutting the cord: Digital TV Antenna Cost: $25-$50 (one-time) The type of antenna you need will vary based on how far you live from a major city (or wherever your network stations are broadcast from). The farther away you live, the stronger (and more expensive) the antenna you’ll need. Google Chromecast Cost: $35 (one-time) This tiny, cheap device simply pops into an HDMI port behind your TV and allows you to stream stuff from your smartphone or computer over Wi-Fi. This is just one of many affordable ($100 or less) and user-friendly options for TV streaming — others include Amazon’s Fire Stick, a Roku box, or Apple TV; if we ever upgrade, it will probably be to a Roku box. You could really get by with just a $5 HDMI cable that connects a laptop to your TV, but for the modest one-time investment, I think having one of these devices is well worth it. Comcast Internet Service Cost: $65/month Yes, that’s ludicrous – the national average is closer to $47 a month. We live in the Boston area, where just about everything is pricey, but the other wrinkle is that our city has a long-term deal with Comcast, which essentially grants the company a temporary monopoly over cable and broadband internet service; we have no other options for truly high-speed connection. (We tried DSL for a while during the DirecTV experiment, and it just didn’t cut it for us.) If you really want to get outraged, consider that, unlike your cable TV fees — about half of which get passed on to broadcasters like ESPN, TBS, and so on — 90% of your internet fees are pure profit for the cable company. They’ve already done the hard work of laying cables to your house, and they’re not splitting any of the money with those cable channels. As more people cut the cord, we can probably expect cable companies to recoup those losses with higher rates on broadband internet service. It’s also worth noting that some internet providers are setting data limits even on home internet use; Comcast, for example, now caps most users at 1 terabyte of bandwidth per month. That’s an enormous amount of data — a threshold that Comcast says 99% of users will never reach. But the potential exists for further restrictions or price increases. Netflix Cost: $10/month We’ve had a Netflix subscription since it was just a red envelope in the mail. The price has gone up since then, and the offerings aren’t always what they were in the company’s early days, but given the mix of movies, TV series, and kid’s content (all with no commercials, unlike Hulu Plus which charges roughly the same fee), I still consider it a great value. Amazon Prime Cost: $99/year ($8/month) Like internet, this is another service we would probably pay for anyway, just for the free two-day shipping. Amazon’s free (for Prime members) video library isn’t exactly Netflix-caliber, but it’s quite good, including hysterically raunchy comedies like Catastrophe and Broad City. Total upfront costs: $60 Ongoing monthly cost: $18/month + broadband internet How Much We’ve Saved Over Four Years Americans paid an average of $103 a month for cable TV in 2016, according to Fortune. That’s more than advertised starter rates, but it’s the reality for most people who aren’t first-time customers. And it’s not even including internet service! But when the cable company tacks on fees for each DVR and HD receiver, not to mention extra channels, it’s easy to see how it adds up. Even assuming we didn’t pay the national average, and instead simply kept our modest DirecTV lineup at $80 a month (or a similar Comcast package, without any fancy channels such as HBO), we’ve saved an enormous amount of money over the past four years by cutting the cord: Cable TV: 48 months at $80/month = $3,840 Netflix and Amazon Prime: 48 months at $18/month = $864 Add in the upfront cost of a Chromecast and HD antenna, and we’ve saved $2,916 to date – and another $62 each month. Meanwhile, someone paying the national average of $103 a month for cable would have saved over $4,000 by now. Here’s another very important thing we’ve saved: time. TV stations know how to keep you watching, especially at night when you ought to be heading to bed. They save the exciting conclusion of a show for the last two minutes, after a commercial break, and then roll right into the next episode so you don’t shut off the tube. I can’t tell you how many completely unnecessary episodes of House Hunters I watched because, like a handful of Doritos, what’s one more before bedtime? As Trent has explained, these are unproductive hours better served by getting a good night’s rest. Now, when we turn on the TV, there are a few options, but it’s not a never-ending dial we can get lost in. And if we want to watch something specific, it takes a tiny bit of effort – and that tiny bit is enough to dissuade me if the inclination isn’t particularly strong. I’ll just read my book instead, which is right on the coffee table. Some Drawbacks to Cord Cutting The single biggest drawback of cord cutting for me, which should be fixed soon enough and may not be a problem for most people, is that I’m unable to watch Boston Red Sox games. I would gladly pay $10 a month or more to stream the games, but the team-owned station, NESN, apparently doesn’t want my money. Meanwhile, for $99 a year, MLB TV allows baseball fans to stream every single baseball game in the country — except for their home team’s games! That would be perfect if I lived 500 miles from home, but currently it’s just a painful, almost farcical insult to most fans. (My solution? I listen to games on the radio like it’s 1947 — I’ll be honest, it’s pretty darned relaxing — and I use some of our cord cutting savings to attend more games in person at the ballpark.) We also don’t have a DVR — the ability to record live TV and pause, rewind, or fast-forward through commercials. It’s not impossible though: You can buy your own DVR for a one-time, upfront fee of a couple hundred bucks if it’s a big deal for you. Given that cable companies typically charge $10 or more each month to lease them, you’ll break even after two years. And another trick is that, because this is still a nascent idea in a bogged-down industry, getting all the shows you want can require a piecemeal approach. We use the Chromecast because it’s so cheap, but some competitors with their own combination of video content and streaming hardware — notably Amazon and Apple – don’t support Google’s Chromecast. So, here are some examples of what I mean: To watch a live show on network television, we use just the TV and its antenna. It’s simple, like 1985, but in crystal-clear HD. To stream videos from Hulu, YouTube, PBS Kids, or Netflix, we launch the app on our phone and just click the Chromecast icon, which connects to our TV over Wi-Fi. You can adjust volume in most of the apps, and the Chromecast even turns on the TV by itself and automatically switches to the correct input, often negating the need for a remote. To watch something on Amazon, we use our laptop – loading the video in a Google Chrome web browser, and then clicking the Chromecast icon at the top right. Again, it automatically turns on the TV and streams over Wi-Fi. This is a bit more cumbersome, but still easy enough. And to watch something on iTunes – where we have a bunch of kids’ movies, unfortunately – we need to connect our iMac to the TV with an HDMI cable; the computer sits on a desk behind the TV, so we actually just leave the two connected at all times. This is the most burdensome process, but one benefit is that it doesn’t require internet or Wi-Fi to work. Other Streaming TV Options for Cord Cutting If giving up cable news, HGTV, or ESPN sounds downright crazy to you, don’t fret: You can still cut your bill way down with a “skinny bundle” live streaming service such as Sling TV, DirecTV Now, or Google’s upcoming YouTube TV service. Sling TV is the cheapest among these, with a package of 20 popular cable channels starting at $20 a month; you can add on extra themed bundles for $5 a month each. I actually used a free trial of Sling during the baseball playoffs last year, and it worked OK… but it froze a few times during the games, whether due to our own poor Wi-Fi signal or the heavy volume of other people in the area watching the Red Sox at the same time. I presume the connection would have been better had I hardwired the computer to the modem instead of depending on Wi-Fi, but I’ve never had trouble streaming live coverage of, say, the Olympics or the NCAA tournament over Wi-Fi. YouTube TV is the latest addition to this group – the service was announced just this week and is expected to launch in the next few months. It’s pricier at $35 a month, but will include regional sports networks such as Fox Sports in some areas, which will allow those users to watch live baseball or basketball games, for instance. Another huge bonus is that YouTube TV comes with a cloud-based DVR, so you can record and store favorite shows for up to six months for free. If you’re already comfortable with YouTube and the Google/Android ecosystem, this would likely be a good choice for you. Even if you throw in an extra $5 bundle, add a premium channel like HBO Go, and pay for a Netflix subscription on top of it all, you’ll still be hard pressed to pay more than $60 a month with these services — saving the average cable subscriber $40 or more every single month. Should You Cut the Cord? Obviously, cutting cable isn’t for everyone. I have friends who think we’re completely nuts, and most Americans still view their basic cable package as a need, not a want or a discretionary expense. But I’m 100% happy with our decision, and don’t miss cable TV one bit. When I’m at a friend’s or family member’s house and the TV is blaring commercials, I’m almost appalled because I so rarely see them on our TV diet of Netflix and PBS Kids. Plus, I’ve read more books and started more side hustles in the past four years than ever before. Watching TV sans cable takes a little more effort, and requires a strong internet connection. But given how much money it saves, that’s a deal more than 800,000 Americans who ditched cable in the second quarter of 2016 were apparently willing to take. Have you tried cutting the cord?

Not actual driverless Nissan Leaf. +1 Tweet Share Share Stumble Pin Driverless cars are piquing the interests of just about every car manufacturer on the market, including the Nissan Motor Company. The company launched some testing of a modified Nissan Leaf on the streets of London, England. The week-long trial took the Nissan Leaf through what Nissan calls “a complex route” that included stop signs, dual carriageways, pedestrian crossings, and parking. The testing is expected to last for about a week and Nissan says there have been zero collisions and only a few instances where the driver had to take control of the vehicle to prevent an accident. Nissan has gotten permission to conduct these tests from Transport for London as well as the City of London Police. Transport for London is the governing body that oversees the transportation infrastructure of London so this is all being done with government cooperation. This marks a first for a driverless car to be tested in this way on public thoroughfares in London. “We believe that zero-emission vehicles are the ultimate solution for delivering a smarter, more sustainable future,” said Stuart Jackson from Nissan Europe. “We also believe that autonomous drive technologies will revolutionise the future of mobility, providing more safety, convenience and driving pleasure for everyone.” Nissan is shooting for getting the driverless Nissan Leaf (or whatever car they choose or build for the project) ready to be used at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. Driverless car technology is being heavily researched by not only major car companies but tech companies like Google and Apple have jumped in as well. While the technology is still in its infancy there is obviously a consensus among those with deep pockets that it’s worth investing in. It will be interesting to see where Nissan’s project ends up in 2020 and how the rest of the field will look as well. What do you think of Nissan’s London testing of the driverless Nissan Leaf?

Banking & Finance Construction Education Energy Healthcare Media Real Estate Retail Technology Transport Travel & Hospitality Dubai to Tesla, Google, Uber: Test your driverless cars here Emirate looking to strike partnerships with global carmakers, tech firms, says RTA official Article Photos Videos By Parag Deulgaonkar Sunday, 5 March 2017 12:31 PM The emirate has already conducted tests on driverless vehicles at Business Bay and Downtown Dubai. Dubai wants Tesla, Google and Uber to test their driverless cars on its roads, a senior Road and Transport Authority (RTA) has said. The emirate has already conducted tests on driverless vehicles at Business Bay and Downtown Dubai - the move inspired to achieve Dubai’s goal to make 25 percent of its public transport autonomous by 2030. Last month, the RTA signed an agreement with US-based Tesla to buy 200 electric vehicles fitted with autonomous driving technology. Speaking to Arabian Business recently, Ahmad Hashem Behroozian, chief executive officer, RTA's Licensing Agency, said it is likely to strike partnerships with many global carmakers and technology companies who see to test their autonomous vehicles technologies. “We are in touch with Tesla, Uber and Google. We will see a lot of co-ordination and even partnerships with these companies in the next few years. Many of these companies will bring their cars to Dubai and do their research and development here just like they do in other cities. “We are learning from them and they are also gaining experience from what we are doing in Dubai.” According to the RTA, Dubai autonomous mobility strategy 2030 is expected to result in savings of $6 billion (AED22 billion) per annum, reduce the mobility expenditure by 44 percent, curb demand for parking by 50 percent, reduce carbon emissions by 12 percent and limit traffic accidents and associated losses by 12 percent.

Nexus 6P vs OnePlus 3 Who Takes The Win?

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. The best Google had to offer until Pixel XL was launched used to be Nexus 6P. The smartphone has been designed in partnership with Huawei and its one of the most popular smartphones. Even though Nexus 6P has been launched back in 2015 it still competing against smartphones that have been launched in 2016. Without any doubt, Nexus 6P’s biggest competitor is OnePlus 3. OnePlus 3 was also produced by a Chinese tech manufacturer just like Pixel. The smartphone has been equipped with only high-end hardware pieces and it even managed to get the nickname “flagship killer”. Today we’re going to pin the two smartphones against each other and see which one wins in terms of display technology and hardware power. Nexus 6P vs OnePlus 3: Display Huawei has equipped the smartphone with a large 5.7 inch AMOLED panel. The display features a pixel resolution of 1440 x 2560 and a large pixel density of 518 ppi. Additionally, Huawei has also coated the panel in Corning Gorilla Glass 4 therefore increasing the device’s scratch and crack resistance. On the other hand, OnePlus 3 ships with a slightly smaller 5.5 inch Optic AMOLED panel. The display features a full HD pixel resolution of 1080 x 1920 and a rather small pixel density of 401 ppi. Just like Nexus 6P, OnePlus 3’s display has been coated in Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and features the same shock resistance. Nexus 6P vs OnePlus 3: Hardware Performance Nexus 6P is fueled by Qualcomm’s octa-core Snapdragon 810 chipset. The processor has been coupled with an Adreno 430 graphics processing unit and 3GB of RAM. On another note, OnePlus 3 is powered by more powerful Qualcomm quad-core Snapdragon 820 chipset. Additionally, the processor has been paired with an Adreno 530 graphics processing unit and the whopping amount of 6GB of RAM. Nexus 6P vs OnePlus 3: Conclusion Nexus 6P takes the win in the display department, but OnePlus 3 wins the hardware performances fight. Even though having a high resolution display is nice, hardware performance is way more important. This is why we have to give it to OnePlus 3. Nonetheless, Nexus 6P is more than capable of providing users with stable hardware performances.

Training Certification Events Webinars Community Participate Q&A Forums Blogs Resources Newsletter Distributions Publications Infographics Photos Videos Jobs Swapnil Bhartiya March 2, 2017 How to Install Debian, Ubuntu, or Kali Linux on Your Chromebook acer-chromebook.jpg Learn how to get the best of both worlds and run your favorite Linux distro and Chrome OS side by side in this step-by-step guide. Creative Commons Zero Pixabay Chromebooks are steadily gaining market share. With the arrival of Android apps to the platform, Chromebooks have become an ideal platform for a very large user-base, and Chrome OS is a very important piece of technology in the current consumer space. However, if you are a Linux user, you may need many utilities and tools to get the job done. For example, I run my own servers and manage them remotely. At the same time, I also manage my Linux systems and a file server at home. I need tools. Additionally, Chrome OS, as a result of being a Google product, has some restrictions. For example, there is no way to even download Creative Commons YouTube videos on Chromebook. What if I want to download Ubuntu or openSUSE and create a bootable USB drive? As much as Chrome OS is a Linux-based desktop, it does lack some features. So, you need what I call a “legacy” Linux desktop on your Chromebook. But wiping Chrome OS and installing a desktop Linux on it would mean losing access to millions of Android apps and games. What if you can get the best of both worlds? What if you can run a pure Linux distribution and Chrome OS, side by side, without dual booting? That’s exactly what Crouton does. Preparing your Chromebook for Crouton Crouton is supported on a wide range of Chromebooks. I tested it on my ASUS Chromebook Flip, and it worked great. Chromebooks keep all data and files on Google servers, so you don’t have to worry about taking a backup of your files as you have to do on other operating systems. However, if you have files on a local ‘Download’ folder, then you must take a backup as the next step will wipe everything from your Chromebook. Once you have taken the backup on an external drive, it’s time to create a recovery image of your operating system to restore it if something goes wrong or if you want to go back to the stock Chromebook experience. Install Chromebook recovery utility from the Chrome web store. Open the app and follow the instructions to create the recovery drive. It’s an easy three-step, click next process. All you need is working Internet and a USB drive with at least 4GB space. chromebook-f1.png Figure 1: Install the Chromebook Recovery Utility from the Chrome Web Store. Creative Commons Attribution Swapnil Bhartiya chromebook-f2.png Figure 2: Then follow the easy to follow instructions. Creative Commons Attribution Swapnil Bhartiya Once the recovery disk is created, unplug it and proceed with the following steps. You can also create a recovery disk from Linux, macOS and Windows PCs using the Chrome web browser. Open web store in Chrome browser and install recovery tool. Once installed, follow the above procedure. Change to developer mode If you have the latest Chromebook, you can easily enable the developer mode by holding  Esc + Refresh keys and then pushing  the ‘power’ button. It will boot into recovery mode, which will show a scary warning on the screen (this warning will appear at every reboot). Just ignore it and let Chrome OS wipe your data. The process can take up to 15 minutes, so don’t turn off your Chromebook. Once the system has successfully booted into developer mode, at every reboot you will see the warning screen. You can either wait for a few seconds for it to automatically boot into Chrome OS, or press Ctrl+d to immediately boot into Chrome OS. Now log into your Gmail account as usual and open the command-line interface by pressing Ctrl+alt+t. Once in the terminal, open Bash shell by typing: 
shell
 In another tab, open the Crouton GitHub page and download Crouton (it’s downloaded into the Downloads directory) There are many operating systems available for Chromebooks via Crouton, including Debian, Ubuntu, and Kali Linux.

Releases marked with * are unsupported, but may work with some effort.
chronos@localhost / $ As is self-evident, not all distributions or releases are supported. If you are planning to install Ubuntu, it defaults to Precise release, which is quite old, so you may face issues with Crouton on some machines. I heavily recommend using Trusty release. To find which releases are available, run this command in the shell: 
sh ~/Downloads/crouton -r list To find which DEs are available, run: 
sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t list Let’s say you want to install Xfce, the lightweight distribution suited for the low-powered device, but you want to install Ubuntu Trusty. You would use this pattern: 
sh ~/Downloads/crouton -r trusty -t xfce If you want to install the default Ubuntu distribution with xfce instead, use: 
sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t xfce The installation can take a bit longer because Crouton downloads the entire distribution over the Internet and installs it. In my case, it took more than 20 minutes. Once the installation is complete, it will ask you to create a username and password. Now you can boot into your Linux distribution with this command: 
sudo startTARGET Replace TARGET with your desktop environment. If you installed Xfce, the command to start it will be: 
sudo startxfce4 If you installed Unity, run: 
sudo startunity The most interesting thing about Crouton is that it runs the desired Linux distribution simultaneously with Chrome OS, which means you can easily switch between the two operating systems as if you’re switching between two tabs of a browser. Using: 
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+ <- switches back to Chrome OS and typing 
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+-> switches to Ubuntu Linux. Now you have a standard Linux distribution running on Chromebook and you can install any package that you want. Bear in mind that, depending on your architecture, some packages may or may not be available because not all Linux applications are available for ARM processors. That’s where the “best of both worlds” concept comes into play. You can simply switch back to Chrome OS and use applications like Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, and thousands of games and applications that are available through Android. At the same time, you can also access all the Linux utilities, whether it’s sshing into your server or using applications like GIMP and LibreOffice. To be honest, I do most of my consumer side work in Chrome OS; it has almost all commercial and popular apps and services. Whether I want to watch Netflix, HBO Now, Hulu, or Amazon Prime, I can do this on the same machine where I can also use core Linux utilities and manage my servers easily. That’s what I call the best of both worlds. Learn more about Linux through the free "Introduction to Linux" course from The Linux Foundation and edX.

Android Wear 2.0 - is it finally time to buy a smartwatch? GOOGLE has unveiled the latest generation of its Android Wear 2.0 wearable technology software - so is it now time to invest in a new smartwatch? By Michael Moore PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 11:01, Sun, Mar 5, 2017 LGIs Android Wear the key to unlocking your smartwatch potential? Android Wear 2.0 is out now. Google revealed its next generation software platform last month, marking the company’s most advanced wearable release to date. With Mobile World Congress 2017 seeing the first group of new devices running the new software being shown off to the world, it’s clear to see that Android Wear 2.0 marks a major step up from past generations. But does this mean that it’s finally time for users to embrace the smartwatch buzz and buy their first wearable? LGAndroid Wear 2.0 is set to be the most popular wearable software yet First, lets take a look at some of the improvements that Android Wear 2.0 brings over the original release. The launch comes three years after the release of the original Android Wear, meaning there’s a whole host of new and exciting features that should make using a smartwatch easier and more appealing than ever before. Top of the list is Google’s new voice-activated smart assistant. Previously only available in the Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, the Google Assistant is a hands-free way to get all the information you need, direct to your wrist. Ask the Google Assistant a question and it will respond - whether that’s asking about the weather, how best to get to work, or even making a restaurant reservation. All you need to do is hold down the power button on your watch, or say “OK Google”, and the Assistant will spring to life. LGAndroid Wear 2.0's flexibility should allow for a wide range of devices The Google Assistant can also bring is a quicker way to write or respond to messages via dictation. In fact, sending a text or instant message is easier than ever with Android Wear 2.0, as users can tap on a notification to respond via typing, dictation or for the first time, drawing with their finger. Apps including Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts and WhatsApp are all included, and will also be covered by Android Wear 2.0’s new Smart Reply feature, which learns from your typing habits to provide quick suggestions for your next words. Android Wear 2.0 also bring more customisation to your watch than ever before, with users able to personalise their first choice watch face to always display information and notifications from their favourite apps. This means you can get updates on your calendar meetings, fitness information or message alerts with just a look. Up to eight different watch faces can be customised in this way, meaning you’re never too far from the updates you need. HUAWEIThe Huawei Watch 2 looks to show off all the best features of Android Wear 2.0 Best of all, Android Wear 2.0 brings an end to the era of needing your phone with you at all times to enjoy the most out of your smartwatch. The new software allows users to download apps directly from the Google Play app store to their watch. Google has introduced specially-designed versions of many popular apps for Android Wear 2.0, including the likes of AccuWeather, Uber, Runkeeper and more. If you have the right network connection, you can also make calls and use these apps no matter where you are - or where your phone is.  HUAWEIThe Huawei Watch 2 comes with full Android Wear 2.0 support So it seems that Android Wear 2.0 brings a lot of software advantages - but what about the devices themselves? A number of the world’s biggest tech firms released Android Wear watches, and interest in the new platform has already been high. LG was the first company to launch an Android Wear 2.0 device, with the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style revealed alongside Google’s launch of the new software. The LG Watch Sport targets more athletic customers, with built-in GPS and 4G LTE connectivity making it an intelligent standalone device. In contrast, the LG Watch Style is a slimmer, more stylish device which is available in silver, titanium and rose gold colour schemes. Both are set to go on sale in the UK later this year, and to be honest its hard to see much wrong with either device. Related articles Apple Watch Series 2 - Best deals on this new smartwatch Apple Watch Series 2 UPDATE - Apple is about to fix an annoying issue As mentioned, this launch has now been followed by a number of new products revealed at Mobile World Congress 2017. Among the new Android Wear 2.0 devices is the Huawei Watch 2, which like LG’s offering is available in two distinct styles - ‘Classic’ or ’Sport’ editions, each with their own special features and design. Huawei says its new wearable will look to appeal to smartphone users looking for something extra to compliment their mobile device. The Huawei Watch 2 Classic version comes with a hybrid-leather strap, and is available in a range of different colour options, for those looking to stand out from the crowd. The fitness-focused Sport edition comes with a purely rubber strap which should stand up to wear and tear - much like the watch itself, which is IP68 compliant with water and dust resistance. But for those looking for something a bit more high-end, luxury watch firm Tag Heuer is also reportedly hard at work on its first Android Wear 2.0 device.  According to inside sources, the company will reveal more about their new device next month - and it looks pretty special. Early rumours suggest that Tag's new watch will be both smart and mechanical with users able to switch between old-fashioned and hi-tech as they wish. TAG HEUERTag Heuer could be set to release a luxury Android Wear 2.0 device soon However these are far from the only devices that will be able to run Android Wear 2.0, as Google is also making the platform available to a number of older products. This includes popular wearables such as the Moto 360 2nd generation, LG Watch Urbane and Huawei Watch, although some Android Wear 2.0 features will only be able to be used on certain devices with the correct hardware. The full list of compatible devices also includes ASUS ZenWatch 2 & 3, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch, Casio PRO TREK Smart, Fossil Q Founder, Fossil Q Marshal, Fossil Q Wander, LG G Watch R, Michael Kors Access Smartwatches, New Balance RunIQ, Nixon Mission, Polar M600 and TAG Heuer Connected. So the big question - is now the time to splash out on an Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch? If you’re looking for your first Android wearable, it’s hard to see much wrong with any of the new devices, with stylish design and builds matched with a much more complete software offering. The power of the Google Assistant should be reason enough to upgrade, as it offers far more usability and handy features than ever before. Unlike Apple’s WatchOS, Android Wear 2.0 can also be licensed by many manufacturers, allowing different companies to tease the most out of the software.

Apple Watch Series 2 – In Pictures Thu, September 22, 2016 Apple Watch Series 2 includes an in-built GPS, faster processor and brighter screen. It's also water resistant to a depth of 50 metres. Play slideshow EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS 1 of 16 Apple Watch Series 2 includes an in-built GPS, faster processor and brighter screen Finally, there’s price. Much like premium smartphones, Android Wear 2.0 devices will largely set you back less than buying the latest Apple Watch. The Apple Watch Series 2 currently starts from £369 if you buy direct from Apple - around £50 less than the expected price of the Huawei Watch 2 and both LG Watch models.  If you have the budget, an Apple Watch 2 can even set you back as much as £1,049. Admittedly, the older Apple Watch Series 1 can be yours for £269, but if you’re in the market for a brand-new smartwatch, you’d probably prefer to get the latest device. Overall, it may ultimately come down to personal preference. Apple fans will doubtlessly prefer to go for an Apple Watch, whereas Android users may plump for a device that runs the same family of software as their smartphone.

If only Advertisers shout, but who is listening? Photograph: Alamy Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Sunday 5 March 2017 04.00 EST There is, alas, no such thing as a free lunch. The trouble with digital technology, though, is that for a long time it encouraged us to believe that this law of nature had been suspended. Take email as an example. In the old days, if you wanted to send a friend a postcard saying: “Just thinking of you”, you had to find a postcard and a pen, write the message, find a stamp and walk to a postbox. Two days later – if you were lucky – your card reached its destination. But with email you just type the message, press “send” and in an instant it is delivered to your friend’s inbox, sometimes at the other end of the world. No stamp, no expense, no hassle. It turns out that the advertising industry is beginning to smell a rat in this hi-tech nirvana It is the same with using the cloud to store our digital photographs, browse the web, download podcasts, watch YouTube Lolcats, look up Wikipedia and check our Facebook newsfeeds. All free. Well, up to a point. Most of us eventually tumbled to the realisation that if the service is free, we are the product. Or, rather, our personal data and the digital trails we leave on the web are the product. The data is sliced, diced and sold to advertisers in a vast, hidden – and totally unregulated – system of high-speed, computerised auctions that ensure each user can be exposed to ads that precisely match their interests, demographics and gender identity. And this is done with amazing, fine-grained resolution: Facebook, for example, holds 98 data points on every user. Welcome to the world of “surveillance capitalism”. Still, consider the benefits for advertisers. Once upon a time, advertising was like carpet bombing. You paid a lot of money to put ads in newspapers and magazines or on television and billboards, but it was all hit and miss: you could never be sure what worked. As a US department store magnate, John Wanamaker, once said: “Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is, I don’t know which half.” But when Google and then Facebook arrived, all this apparently changed. The technology deployed by these outfits could ensure that only people likely to be receptive to particular messages would be shown those messages. Wanamaker’s heirs could be sure that their advertising dollars were hitting the spot. And on this foundation, Google and Facebook (and, for a while, Yahoo) made money like it was going out of fashion. It was, as the cliche puts it, a win‑win situation. And so the advertisers’ money, diverted from print and TV, cascaded into the coffers of Google and co. In 2012, Procter & Gamble announced that it would make $1bn in savings by targeting consumers through digital and social media. It has got to the point where, according to last week’s Financial Times, 2017 will be the year when advertisers spend more online than they do on TV. Trebles all round, then? Not quite. It turns out that the advertising industry is beginning to smell a rat in this hi-tech nirvana. In a speech to the annual conference of the Internet Advertising Bureau in January, the Procter & Gamble boss, Marc Pritchard, said this: “We have seen an exponential increase in, well… crap. Craft or crap? Technology enables both and all too often the outcome has been more crappy advertising accompanied by even crappier viewing experiences… is it any wonder ad blockers are growing 40%?” But the exponential growth in crap is not the biggest problem, he said. Much more worrying was the return of the Wanamaker problem: how many people are actually seeing these ads? Perhaps what he had in mind was an advertising industry investigation that suggested around a third of online ads may be “seen” not by humans but by bots. Pritchard regards the hidden machinery of surveillance capitalism as “murky at best and fraudulent at worst. We need to clean it up and invest the time and money we save into better advertising to drive growth.” Robert Mercer: the big data billionaire waging war on mainstream media Read more So here’s version 2.0 of the Wanamaker problem: the US industry is throwing astonishing amounts of money at online advertising and yet the growth rate of the industry is anaemic and nobody knows how effective online advertising really is. “Some might say,” said Pritchard, “we’re squandering this wonderful gift of technology.” They might. But eventually people will ask: what’s the rate of return of online advertising? Who’s benefiting from this vast, opaque, unregulated, unmonitored and ultimately user-hostile online auction system? Part of the answer may be glimpsed in the share prices of Google and Facebook. But mostly it’s to be found in the profits of the data-brokers, cookie monsters, trackers and other corporate creatures that lurk in the shadows cast by the internet giants. And they’re not talking.

She spots something that needs doing, takes a deep breath, and gets on Google. Lots of folks here in town offer advice, but she knows there are experts out there in the Googleverse poised to deliver the precise information she needs to get the job done right. For example, we had rats in the attic. Unacceptable to be sure, but hardly a topic I wanted to discuss at length. My hope was that they would tire of scooting through the rafters, eating insulation and wiring, and head back out in search of more appropriate rat chow. You know, take care of this on their own, without our having to jump in with corrective measures. Live and let live, that’s my motto, especially when it comes to climbing into a dark space inhabited by rats of some size, and I knew they were sizable rats because even a novice student of rodent behavior knows the difference between skittering (mice) and thumping (rats of some size). Here’s the thing — once you know you have rats in the attic, you pretty much can’t un-know that rats of some size are up there doing profoundly rattish things under cover of darkness. The thumping was intermittent, then constant, then accompanied by a sort of sloshing, leaving no doubt that uninhibited predation was taking place up there. For all we knew, rats were stacking corpses like fire wood, and once the aroma of decomposing whatever-it-was up there seeped into the walls, it would be tougher to eliminate than the predators themselves. Next stop, obviously, Google. Try it. Type in “rat extermination,” skip past the many outfits and enterprises happy to bring in extermination experts, and continue until you see Ratcontroltricks.com, where Jeff R. Morrison provides more information about do-it-yourself ratting than you might have thought possible. “Social media,” he advises, “is one of the easiest ways for us to keep you updated with the latest news in the rodent control world!” I can’t begin to describe the many fast-breaking stories emerging from the rodent control world, but I will pass on an observation that struck me as humane. Rodent controllers use a curious phrase to describe the rat’s sensory sensibilities; apparently, the rat is directed by what they term “essential oils,” by which I take it they mean those elements in the rat’s world that are appropriate and comforting to the rat. These essential oils are all over the ratscape, and the intrusion of foreign … oils … as introduced when plopping down the waiting jaws of the rat trap, give notice to the rat that he would be well served to stay away from the unfamiliar aroma and device. Foiled again! Confounded, when all else fails, the do-it-yourself rat battler can slap that bad boy in the whiskers with an assault upon the essential oils themselves. Dipping rags in ammonia, draping the rags throughout the rat kingdom, renewing the ammonia bath for several days seems to so offend even the sulkiest of rodents that they pack up their belongings and hit the road. Mission accomplished. Maybe. We hope. But now, the time has come to search for ammonia-stench-dot-com in the hope of allowing our own essential oils to resume their rightful place in the home we choose to not share with sloshing, fat rodents. I’m actually not anxious to get into social-media conversations about odor, so if anyone has advice to offer, please feel free to jump right in. Peter Arango lives in Medford.

Its volunteer-edited web directory formed the basis for early search offerings from Netscape, AOL, and Google. But 19 years later, there's some bad news. koavf writes: As posted on the DMOZ homepage, the Open Directory Project's web listing will go offline on March 14, 2017. Founded in 1998 as "Gnuhoo", the human-curated directory once powered Google and served as a model for Wikipedia. A 1998 Slashdot editorial prompted Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation to complain about how "Gnu" was used in the site's name. "We renamed GnuHoo to NewHoo," a blog post later explained, "but then Yahoo objected to the 'Hoo' (and our red letters, exclamation point, and 'comical font')." After being acquired for Netscape's "Open Directory Project," their URL became directory.mozilla.org, which was shortened to DMOZ. Search Engine Land predicts the memory of the Open Directory Project will still be kept alive by the NOODP meta tag. The site was so old that its hierarchical categories were originally based on the hierarchy of Usenet newsgroups. As it nears its expiration date, do any Slashdot readers have thoughts or memories to share about DMOZ? aol internet mozilla ← Related Links → Which Linux Browser Is The Fastest?

Someone contacted DMOZ with a simple request not to keep listing the old address, because their influence on search engines was distorting the rankings and putting the old, soon-to-disappear, out-of-date site higher than the new, up-to-date one. That was creating significant problems for people getting the wrong information, and that in turn was causing a lot of hassle and wasted time for our volunteer organisers who had to clean up the mess. The DMOZ rep basically told us they wouldn't change anything because they were there for users not site operators. They couldn't seem to understand that what we were asking was in the interests of those users, nor why we blocked all traffic giving their site as a referrer from both sites afterwards. From our perspective, it might have been a well-intentioned idea, but it was run by people with a terrible attitude and ultimately did more harm than good.

It was a great idea when it was created, but over time the landscape of the web changed. DMOZ was founded before Wikipedia and even Google, back in the days that finding stuff was *hard*. DMOZ editors would curate lists of sites that would give a good overview of the topic, but it turns out that Wikipedia's approach to topic curation was better in the long run (and I think that many DMOZ editors are also Wikipedia editors). Directories also died a death as search engines got better, and in the end DMOZ was only really important for SEO purposes. A long outage at the end of 2006 didn't help at all, and many editors didn't come back after that. Every time I log in I am horrified at the enormous backlog of submissions. For a long time, DMOZ was a great and useful resource. I don't think it has been the case for a while though, but the data it curated is still of value and it would be good if it could be preserved somehow.

I promise, I promise on my children’s heads because last Wednesday the Government brought the final curtain down on my worst habit and lethal addiction, and one I can’t just give up for Lent, I must give up for ever. My worst habit by far, as terrified family members and other road-users will confirm, is using my mobile at the wheel. I’m a guilty player in a national epidemic of fatal bad manners on the highway that on March 1, the Government cracked down on: it’s now six penalty points, a £200 fine, even a possible driving ban for some offenders. Serious stuff. 'Sixty people have been killed by drivers using mobiles in the past three years, and the South East (where I live) is the worst blackspot for the accidents.' Sixty people have been killed by drivers using mobiles in the past three years, and the South East (where I live) is the worst blackspot for the accidents. So these penalties are long overdue, but I’m terrified. It’s not as if I haven’t been caught already. A few months back, I was in the middle of a long, pleasurable gossip as I drove through West London. My iPhone sat in its cradle at eye level, on the screen Google Maps. Yak yak yak, I went, and then, to my horror: a blue flashing light in the wing mirror. Policeman on a motorbike eyeballing me. Caught red-handed. The cop jabbed a finger towards the garage just up ahead on the left, so I drove in. Cursed by the 'disease to please'  It’s terrible that the first person many women blame when bad things are done to them is themselves.  Jane Fonda says she was raped and sexually abused as a child and was fired because she wouldn’t sleep with her boss ‘and I always thought it was my fault; that I didn’t do or say the right thing’.  This isn’t quite as self-flagellating as Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde, who says she has only herself to blame for when she was sexually assaulted.  I remember thinking when I was attacked in the street that it was my fault for sneaking off to an Emmanuelle film with my boyfriend without telling my mother.  Bravo to Jane Fonda, 79, to name the common condition many women of all ages suffer from to their own cost: Hanoi Jane calls it the ‘disease to please’.  Time we found a lasting and permanent cure for this disease of my sex. He hopped off, I put the handbrake on, but the car still rolled on before coming to a standstill (it’s always done that). ‘You were talking on your mobile,’ he told me sternly. ‘And your handbrake does not work. I’d say, Madam, you’re [he glanced at his watch under a leather gauntlet as if the countdown to driving doomsday had started] this close to being off the road.’ What would you do? What would an honest Injun do? Certainly not what I did. Then, it was £100 and three points, rather than double that, but still – possibly the end of the road for me, I wasn’t sure of the penalty points system, so I panicked. ‘No I wasn’t, officer,’ I whined. ‘I was just using Google Maps!’ and pointed to the offending mobile. ‘But I’ve been behind you, watching you, for ten minutes,’ said the policeman, who clearly thought I had been dangerously distracted even if I hadn’t actually been holding the phone. I collapsed like a pricked inflatable. I considered the options. And I did the only thing I thought I could do in the circumstances. The PC with red hair glared at me, and I said he was right. I was wrong. I admitted I had lied, and I apologised. And I am sorry to say he let me off. Just this once. It was my lucky day – but maybe, I allow, not yours. My name is Rachel Johnson and I am a mobile-phone addict, and therefore a danger to society. It wasn’t the first time I’d done it. It was merely the first time I’d been caught.

Share this article Share So this is my promise to nice PC Ginger and all other road users. This has been a lesson to me, and I hope to you. These new laws are as tough as they need to be. It won’t happen again, officer, I swear. It’s cold turkey, and then one day at a time.   Kellyanne Conway, 50, in the Oval Office Kellyanne Conway, 50, was caught crouching on the Oval Office sofa like a texting schoolgirl in her teenage bedroom.  Which told us this: she’s more than at home in the White House, the mansion built by slaves that now houses the President and his men, but not, for the moment, his wife. As the hyper-relaxed pose – stilettos tucked under her bony butt – revealed: Conway has the run of the place, and she and Trump are clearly comfortable together as colleagues.  If I was Melania – who, unlike Kellyanne, has not put a foot wrong, let alone two – I would definitely have a word.    That's not a dress - it's just a distraction  Jennifer Aniston, 48, at the Oscars last week To the big question of the week: how much is too much?  Actress Brie larson appeared on The One Show last week in what one critic supplieted was a 'pre-watershed busty display'.  Emma Watson, the actress and feminist activist, flashed underboob with predictable results (accusations that she'd gone 'topless' and 'posed semi nude').  Jennifer Aniston was ticked off for showing both breasts and leg at the Oscars.  The answer is this. If your boobs are all anyone is talking about - not your latest film (Larson and Aniston), or your opinions on female genital mutilation (Watson) - then you're showing too much.    Quotes of the week ‘If Richard was a member of the Secret Service, then maybe Ken Dodd was in charge of MI5.’ Kathryn Apanowicz, partner of the late Richard Whiteley, after actor Ricky Tomlinson claimed the former Countdown host was a spy. ‘The good news is we got to see some extra speeches.’ Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel after La La Land was mistakenly announced as the winner of Best Film instead of Moonlight. ‘Don’t get me started on the Yorkshire puddings.’ Twitter user as Cambridge students complain that dishes such as Jamaican stew are racist. ‘Been there, done that.’ Astronaut Buzz Aldrin’s reaction to tycoon Elon Musk’s mission to send tourists around the Moon. ‘Never kick a man until he is down.’ Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman, who died last week aged 86, with his ‘golden rule of politics’. ‘Use your mobile and drive and as of today you’ll end with more points on your licence than Liverpool FC got in February… six.’ Greater Manchester Police poke fun at Liverpool’s loss of form in a road safety message. ‘I bought an Aston Martin but I just feel like a t** in it.’ Pop star Ed Sheeran admits his wealth can leave him feeling uncomfortable. ‘Labour needs a smack in the face. A serious wet fish to the chops.’ MP Jess Phillips bemoans the current state of her party. ‘I get all my 81-year-old mother’s hand- me-downs. Luckily they’re cashmere.’ Mary Berry’s daughter Annabel reveals the pair have a similar sense of style.

Trinidad and Tobago’s steelpan also took center stage in the Washington, D.C., event headlined “Afro-Inspired Culture in the Americas” held in the historic Hall of the Americas at OAS Headquarters, where a bust of Marcus Garvey sits majestically. “The music is exploding in South America and Africa,” renowned Jamaican musicologist Dermott Hussey said of reggae, in a keynote presentation to an international audience at an Organization of American States event ringing out celebrations marking February as Black History Month in the United States. In his discussion on reggae and Marley’s role in it, Hussey also revealed the upcoming publication of “An Oral History of Bob Marley.” Google search data gathered from 2004 to 2015 identify the Poland’s Ostróda as the top city searching reggae; Hua Hin, Thailand, was fourth; and Cambridge, England, ranked sixth while Kingston, Jamaica, ranked stood at 16th among the top 20 cities, said Hussey, who hosts a reggae program on SiriusXM satellite radio. Hussey noted that in 2016, Brazil, the first non-English-speaking country to honor the iconic Jamaican musician, celebrated its first Bob Marley Day on May 11th, the anniversary of Marley’s death in 1981. Hussey, who is now based in Washington, D.C., co-authored the book,  Bob Marley: Reggae King of the World and produced the Marley interview on Marley’s album Talkin’ Blues, revealed other research showing the impact of reggae music, especially Bob Marley’s, on babies was also successfully demonstrated.

(Photo Derrick Scott) He drew on a recent University of Glasgow study and other experiments that underscore reggae’s growth to become “an international music” since its emerged on the scene some 50 years ago. He said as a result, Britain’s Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals plans on installing a sound system in all kennels, “to play Bon Jovi and Bob Marley.” His persona, his music, and message “are as alive globally as when he lived,” Hussey said of Marley, sharing that today, 36 years after his death, “he’s got 70 million Facebook fans.” The steelpan, Trinidad and Tobago’s national instrument, “was born in struggle,” asserted Von Martin, host of the long-running Caribbeana program that signed Washington, D.C.’s WPFW 89.3 FM  station on the air in the summer of 1977. A Caribbean musicology expert and broadcaster who hails from Trinidad and Tobago, Martin delivered a fascinating history of steelpan’s very emergence as “the product of real suffering and pain but, at the same time, happiness and celebration.” The only acoustic instrument invented in the 20th century developed against the backdrop of the enslavement of African people and colonization from the 16th century, culminating in the mid-20th century with independence . “Pan was there as an eyewitness – immersed in it all,” as Martin told it. The Jamaican Ambassador Audrey Marks was on hand, among many of the member state representatives to the hemispheric organization. OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro welcomes the guests and staff, while Assistant Secretary General Nestor Mendez, whose office organized the event, took “A look at Afro-inspired culture in the Americas.” Posted in: Entertainment Subscribe If you enjoyed this article, subscribe to receive more just like it.

Frank Franklin II/AP | Caption Loading... Charlie Wood Staff | @walkingthedot March 4, 2017 —If they want to recruit foreign talent this year, Facebook and Google may have to wait.   US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced a six-month suspension of the H-1B expedited service option on Friday, an adjustment many suspect is the first in a more serious reform effort by the Trump administration. Silicon Valley opposed Trump’s travel ban as well, but the unintended consequences of the H-1B visa program has made it enemies on both sides of the aisle. H-1B’s stated purpose is to attract highly educated specialists to US jobs that companies can’t fill, and while it applies to a number of industries, the majority of recipients work in technology. A 2015 USCIS report to Congress found that the previous year, 65 percent of approved petitions were for computer-related jobs. Facebook is classified as an “H-1B dependent” company, with more than 15 percent of its employees relying on the program. The visas are good for three years, after which they can be extended for another three. Trump's biggest executive actions, explained The “premium processing” option, first introduced in 2001, allowed companies to pay an extra $1,225 to have their petitions reviewed in two weeks, rather than the usual two to three months. As of April 3rd, that service is dead, although USCIS says that an expedited option will remain available in special cases such in emergencies and for humanitarian reasons.   USCIS claims the measure is necessary to work through a backlog of applications, but this explanation confuses some, who point out that faster processing was cited as a reason for the premium option in the first place. The change has the potential to make big waves in the tech industry, where as many as 1 million H-1B visa holders make up 13 percent of technology jobs, according to The New York Times. The program grants up to 85,000 visas each year across all sectors, but more than 300,000 apply, resulting in a lottery system some find unfair. That lottery is coming up in April, which may explain the timing of the change. The announcement came down almost simultaneously with the publishing of a letter from Sen. Richard Durbin (D) of Illinois asking Trump to revamp the law and replace the lottery with a system prioritizing graduates of US universities and the highest-paid workers. “If you do not take action in the next few weeks, outsourcers will secure the right to import tens of thousands of low-wage foreign guest workers to replace American workers,” Sen. Durbin wrote. He refers to the common complaint that foreign companies game the system by flooding the government with applications, hire workers for temporary training at half the standard salary, then rotate them back to the home country. But some think American companies are unfairly benefiting from the program as well, hiring young, foreign workers for less than they would have to pay more experienced Americans. “The law supposedly forbids underpaying, but the wages it sets are well below market rates. And the law allows hiring young H-1Bs instead of older Americans, at a big cost savings,“ Norman Matloff, a professor of computer science at UC Davis tells The Christian Science Monitor in an email. In Dr. Matloff’s opinion, not even the H-1B recipients are winners. He calls them “de facto indentured servants,” since workers almost always stay at the sponsoring company for the entire three-year period of the visa, a rarity in the fast-moving tech job market.  “I feel like a lot of H-1B holders are kind of held hostage to staying at their company,” says an employee of a large Bay Area tech company, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution. Matloff proposes a number of reforms, including making visa holders waiting for green cards “free to change employers at any time.” The new rules don’t address those concerns yet, but many think this is just the opening salvo in a complete overhaul of the system, which Trump made a cornerstone of his immigration policy during the campaign. "I will end forever the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program," he wrote in a statement on his campaign website.

Like, accidentally knocking your phone from the bathroom counter into the toilet with a freakish flick of the flatiron cord? Or laying your hand just so on the keyboard of your computer so that the display turns sideways, and now you have to Google with your head cranked crosswise in order to research how to reverse it? Or, as a joke, your kid hurls your shoe over their shoulder and into the backyard where it lands perfectly into a new pile of dog poo? This doesn’t happen often in my life, but when it does the results are never in my favor. Any chance that the half-court basketball toss for a kagillion dollars lands in the actual hoop rather than the gym garbage can? Nope. Might possibly the quarters you drop in the car wash fall into the coin slot rather than plunk through the drain as if drawn by a magnet? Of course not! Or maybe that recorded message you accidentally sent your ex is a stellar demonstration of your parenting skills rather than a grouchy tirade about him? NEVER! That last one happened, by the way, six days ago. And lest you think that’s not a feat as ridiculously impossible as I imply, let me tell you about my phone and my expertise in working it. About a month ago I realized my smartphone had stopped dictating texts. Not only that, but Siri was no longer answering my questions when I called on her to tell me how to spell ‘rigmarole’ or explain the movie “Inception.” After extensive Googling we discovered that my phone’s front microphone is no longer working. First of all, my phone has two microphones? And second of all, wouldn’t it be super smart if a two-microphoned smartphone allowed the back microphone to compensate for a faulty front microphone? In addition to all that, imagine that while your front microphone appears to be in charge of dictating texts, your back microphone seems to be in charge of recording them. What kind of crazy is that? Plus, I have never, nor do I now, know how to record a message in my texting app. So imagine my surprise when I looked down at my phone to see that I had somehow sent my ex-husband, the father of my children, one of my driving tirades that just happened to be about him. In my defense, I was tired and grouchy and in my car, a safe place for upending absentee opponents with my brilliant arguments. Of course my absentee opponents never hear them, unless, of course, I record them and accidentally hit send. I couldn’t duplicate this act if I tried. But at least now my ex has heard my brilliant argument and feels soundly chastised, right? Now that’s funny. Do we really think this extraordinary accidental disaster includes a happenstance recording of my best and brightest argument with my ex-husband? Of course not.

Mar 02, 2017 Opinion North America Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Supports K@W's Marketing Content The idea of corporations publicly taking on political and social positions not long ago was considered verboten. Now it seems almost mainstream. Yet companies need to understand that how they present their beliefs is critical, notes Eric Solomon in this opinion piece. He is a brand strategy director for Google. Earlier, he was global director of brand strategy for Spotify, and prior to that head of brand strategy and insights for YouTube. And the Oscar Goes to … This week’s Oscars 2017 broadcast brought us two noteworthy moments. The first, of course, is the one that everyone is talking about: the impossible Hollywood ending that carried on longer than anyone could have imagined. The second moment was far more subtle, but at least for those of us in the ad world, almost as interesting. For the first time since 2010, The New York Times aired a television spot. Beautifully executed, the commercial takes a square aim at the “fake news” phenomenon that is consuming American politics today. The video itself builds with a chorus of opposing claims set in black text against a simple white background (e.g., “the truth is a woman should dress like a woman” vs. “the truth is women’s rights are human rights”), and builds to their poignant new tagline: “The truth is now more important than ever.” We are living during an unprecedented political age, so it’s no coincidence that The New York Times has chosen now to voice their strong point of view. But, they are by no means the only company taking a public stand on a burning issue – neither now, nor in the recent past. Taking a Stand, More Than Ever Having a dedicated point of view is something that defines some of the world’s most iconic, successful brands. This is a big part of what helps a brand differentiate itself from competition, and what helps to fill the gap between the products companies make and the emotional experience a brand idea can convey. For the past few years, it seems that more companies than ever are commenting directly on current social or political issues, communicating beliefs that extend far beyond internal sets of brand guidelines or values. We’ve seen Cheerios take a stand on racial issues and Honey Maid redefine the notion of what a wholesome family looks like. REI has closed their stores on Black Friday in the name of opting outside, and P&G is dedicated to getting people to think twice about what it means to do something “like a girl.” These examples are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. “The election of a new administration raised … important issues around populism, immigration, tensions around race and gender and the overarching question of what it means to be an American.” Without a doubt, 2017 feels different. Regardless of one’s political persuasion, the election of a new administration has raised several important issues around populism, immigration, tensions around race and gender and the overarching question of what it means to be an American. The advertising industry has not kept silent on these and other issues, with several brands opting to spend significant budgets to express their points of view on big stages. Sponsored Content: During Super Bowl LI, for example, football fans were exposed to company beliefs in new and surprising ways. We saw Budweiser tell their story of an immigrant founder; Airbnb unleashed an ode to acceptance; and 84 Lumber, a building-supply company, paid nearly $15 million to air a 90-second story about an immigrant’s journey from Mexico to America, only after having Fox deem a version showing a border wall “too controversial.” (84 Lumber sent viewers to view the ‘complete’ version on their site.) Another interesting take came from Audi of America, who caused unexpected waves by taking a stand for gender equality in the American workplace. And if all that commentary felt a bit heavy-handed, Saturday Night Live offered a salve in the name of parody. When a Belief Is Called into Question Now, back to Audi. Crafted by San Francisco-based Venables Bell & Partners, the ad itself has earned accolades for its cinematic approach to storytelling. A handful of executives have praised Audi’s ad publicly for pushing back hard on gender stereotypes. However, much of the commentary around the ad is critical. The conversation has really caught fire on YouTube: There are over 130,000 comments on the video to date, 56% of which are negative.   Some of this criticism is due to the reality of Audi’s own executive team and board, which reflect a marked lack of diversity. According to some, this may have led to a feeling that Audi is attempting to align themselves politically with an important issue without having the appropriate substantiation for their claims. This is a difficult position for Audi because they have communicated a point of view – one that they’re very likely committed to – which they are now obligated to defend, loudly and publicly. If Audi fails to do that, this calls into question the veracity of their belief; if they succeed, this raises questions about how gender diversity will play out for the brand and company moving forward. “People expect companies to have a point of view on current cultural or political issues.” This example, along with The New York Times’ example and others, illuminates an even grander question: What does it mean for a brand to have a point of view? What do brands or companies need to do in order to comment on political or social issues, and how should they best manage expressions of those beliefs when faced with adversity? Here are a few guidelines for organizational leaders. Have a Belief System Businesses play a big role in our lives. The products we use or consume can be integral to the way that we experience the world, and one role of the brand is to express an emotional reason why we might use or consume one thing over another. It can help to convey that emotional value through what Viacom’s Ross Martin calls a belief system. In a recent talk, Martin defines a belief system as a “clarity of purpose that unites, inspires and catalyzes the power and potential” of a business. Sometimes this belief system is core to a company’s heritage (REI holds a firm commitment to the outdoors); in other instances, beliefs have to be shaped over time (for Honey Maid, wholesome has evolved to equal diversity). In an ideal world, a belief system should permeate everything a company does and says. But, the first action may be for an organization to take a step back and ask: What is our point of view, and how do we express it?  Embrace Authenticity People expect companies to have a point of view on current cultural or political issues. According to a 2014 study, around 75% of millennials believe that businesses should share a point of view about issues and should influence others to get involved in an issue. But people, especially younger people, can smell fakeness a mile away – and they aren’t afraid to call anyone out on it. Once a business develops and expresses a belief system, it must follow through on that point of view in a real, authentic way. Audi may believe that progress equals gender equality, but they need to commit to demonstrating how that belief connects the dots across all facets of their organization. Actions Are More Important Than Words Saying you believe in something is easy. Showing, unequivocally, that you believe something is much harder. During Super Bowl LI, we saw through advertising that Airbnb has a strong point of view about what acceptance means: “No matter who are you are, where you’re from, who you love, or who you worship, we all belong.” But #weaccept is an idea that is bigger than words on a screen. Airbnb is taking action by setting a goal to provide housing for 100,000 people in need, and they’re contributing $4 million to the International Rescue Committee to help support displaced populations globally. Those are actions that speak louder than words.  Prepare to Engage Having a point of view on something sometimes means defending it. There will always be people who oppose a position – that’s the nature of opinions. For companies, this translates to having an engagement strategy when their belief system is under scrutiny or attack. When Honey Maid underscored wholesome as inclusive of same-sex and interracial families, some people didn’t like it. The brand reacted to that opposition by physically turning that negativity in something positive. Honey Maid may have anticipated that taking a stand would elicit some backlash, so they devised a strategy to reinforce their point of view. Developing and maintaining a point of view is hard work for any organization. But we believe, when done well, it can fuel a major source of differentiation across a crowded, noisy landscape. As writer Elie Wiesel, once said: “The opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference.” When companies or brands lack a clear point of view, the net effect can often feel a lot like indifference.

I suggest one more guideline to your excellent list: Build on a foundation of emotional connection with your customers. The brands that have been able to express POVs effectively — Starbucks, Nike, Dove — have done so in part because they have already established an emotional connection with their customers and they use their values messages to further that connection. It seems more difficult for a brand to jump from a very rational, product-centric appeal to a strong social message without having already demonstrated customer empathy and establishing a level of trust and resonance with its customers — connections that are built over time. — denise lee yohn Jack Lichtenstein I hate to seem “old school,” but I look for the “very rational, product-centric appeal.” I am happy with any company that will provide me with a product or service that has the features I need, that does not need lines of disclaimers in their ads, and that will allow me to speak with a human when I need to. I have not seen many companies with points of view that are abhorrent, and so I don’t much care about their efforts to engage me with themes that are developed by teams of marketers to play on emotions and that are, in any case, completely irrelevant to my decision to purchase that good or service. In my professional life, I am a consultant in business and government policy. My clients are interested in my ability to provide sound advice. One of the last things any of them is interested in is whether my political or social beliefs align completely with theirs and make them feel good. In fact, I have to be able to provide them with unalloyed advice about the effects of their actions and stands on various issues (their actual policies and actions as opposed to those that appear in advertisements). For me, if a company provides a good product or service, does not lie or mislead in its communications, and otherwise treats its customers and others with respect, it is fulfilling its part of the social contract. Jack — thank you for your comment. It’s a good reminder that different approaches resonate with different customers — further, it makes me realize I should have clarified that a company must offer a good product and value to customers before reaching for these higher-order connections — having a POV does not make up for having a poor product. Thanks again. — denise lee yohn eric solomon Agree with Denise — and thank you for the comment, Jack! I don’t think what you’re saying is “old school” at all; I believe many people would agree. Adding onto Denise’s comment, however, in cluttered categories where many offerings are more or less at parity, establishing emotional connections and/or proving a strong point of view can help to build saliency, potentially leading to the notion that people are making ‘rational’ decisions to buy or use something even when guided by less logical or conscious motivations. When it comes to aligning to points of view, I think younger people are likely more persuaded by companies that stand out by having something to say. Thanks again for the comment- Eric Jack Lichtenstein Thank you, Denise and Eric. Herewith my last comment on the issue. Your points are cogent and well taken. I completely accept an effort by a business to establish emotional connections where “…many offerings are more or less at parity…”. I am not certain that many offerings are often at parity, but your basic point certainly is valid. Many years ago, a classmate of mine and I started a forum on corporate social responsibility at the Harvard Business School where we were then MBA candidates. Our concern was that businesses conduct their affairs toward their customers, workers, shareholders, communities and others in a responsible and ethical manner. When a company has reached that threshold, then I believe they have a right, and some would say a responsibility, to weigh in on issues that are tangential to their core business. They always should have their own house in order first. Otherwise, an embrace of societal issues seems little more than especially cynical dimension of the marketing mix. Best wishes to you.

Mar 02, 2017 Opinion North America Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Supports K@W's Marketing Content The idea of corporations publicly taking on political and social positions not long ago was considered verboten. Now it seems almost mainstream. Yet companies need to understand that how they present their beliefs is critical, notes Eric Solomon in this opinion piece. He is a brand strategy director for Google. Earlier, he was global director of brand strategy for Spotify, and prior to that head of brand strategy and insights for YouTube. And the Oscar Goes to … This week’s Oscars 2017 broadcast brought us two noteworthy moments. The first, of course, is the one that everyone is talking about: the impossible Hollywood ending that carried on longer than anyone could have imagined. The second moment was far more subtle, but at least for those of us in the ad world, almost as interesting. For the first time since 2010, The New York Times aired a television spot. Beautifully executed, the commercial takes a square aim at the “fake news” phenomenon that is consuming American politics today. The video itself builds with a chorus of opposing claims set in black text against a simple white background (e.g., “the truth is a woman should dress like a woman” vs. “the truth is women’s rights are human rights”), and builds to their poignant new tagline: “The truth is now more important than ever.” We are living during an unprecedented political age, so it’s no coincidence that The New York Times has chosen now to voice their strong point of view. But, they are by no means the only company taking a public stand on a burning issue – neither now, nor in the recent past. Taking a Stand, More Than Ever Having a dedicated point of view is something that defines some of the world’s most iconic, successful brands. This is a big part of what helps a brand differentiate itself from competition, and what helps to fill the gap between the products companies make and the emotional experience a brand idea can convey. For the past few years, it seems that more companies than ever are commenting directly on current social or political issues, communicating beliefs that extend far beyond internal sets of brand guidelines or values. We’ve seen Cheerios take a stand on racial issues and Honey Maid redefine the notion of what a wholesome family looks like. REI has closed their stores on Black Friday in the name of opting outside, and P&G is dedicated to getting people to think twice about what it means to do something “like a girl.” These examples are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. “The election of a new administration raised … important issues around populism, immigration, tensions around race and gender and the overarching question of what it means to be an American.” Without a doubt, 2017 feels different. Regardless of one’s political persuasion, the election of a new administration has raised several important issues around populism, immigration, tensions around race and gender and the overarching question of what it means to be an American. The advertising industry has not kept silent on these and other issues, with several brands opting to spend significant budgets to express their points of view on big stages. Sponsored Content: During Super Bowl LI, for example, football fans were exposed to company beliefs in new and surprising ways. We saw Budweiser tell their story of an immigrant founder; Airbnb unleashed an ode to acceptance; and 84 Lumber, a building-supply company, paid nearly $15 million to air a 90-second story about an immigrant’s journey from Mexico to America, only after having Fox deem a version showing a border wall “too controversial.” (84 Lumber sent viewers to view the ‘complete’ version on their site.) Another interesting take came from Audi of America, who caused unexpected waves by taking a stand for gender equality in the American workplace. And if all that commentary felt a bit heavy-handed, Saturday Night Live offered a salve in the name of parody. When a Belief Is Called into Question Now, back to Audi. Crafted by San Francisco-based Venables Bell & Partners, the ad itself has earned accolades for its cinematic approach to storytelling. A handful of executives have praised Audi’s ad publicly for pushing back hard on gender stereotypes. However, much of the commentary around the ad is critical. The conversation has really caught fire on YouTube: There are over 130,000 comments on the video to date, 56% of which are negative.   Some of this criticism is due to the reality of Audi’s own executive team and board, which reflect a marked lack of diversity. According to some, this may have led to a feeling that Audi is attempting to align themselves politically with an important issue without having the appropriate substantiation for their claims. This is a difficult position for Audi because they have communicated a point of view – one that they’re very likely committed to – which they are now obligated to defend, loudly and publicly. If Audi fails to do that, this calls into question the veracity of their belief; if they succeed, this raises questions about how gender diversity will play out for the brand and company moving forward. “People expect companies to have a point of view on current cultural or political issues.” This example, along with The New York Times’ example and others, illuminates an even grander question: What does it mean for a brand to have a point of view? What do brands or companies need to do in order to comment on political or social issues, and how should they best manage expressions of those beliefs when faced with adversity? Here are a few guidelines for organizational leaders. Have a Belief System Businesses play a big role in our lives. The products we use or consume can be integral to the way that we experience the world, and one role of the brand is to express an emotional reason why we might use or consume one thing over another. It can help to convey that emotional value through what Viacom’s Ross Martin calls a belief system. In a recent talk, Martin defines a belief system as a “clarity of purpose that unites, inspires and catalyzes the power and potential” of a business. Sometimes this belief system is core to a company’s heritage (REI holds a firm commitment to the outdoors); in other instances, beliefs have to be shaped over time (for Honey Maid, wholesome has evolved to equal diversity). In an ideal world, a belief system should permeate everything a company does and says. But, the first action may be for an organization to take a step back and ask: What is our point of view, and how do we express it?  Embrace Authenticity People expect companies to have a point of view on current cultural or political issues. According to a 2014 study, around 75% of millennials believe that businesses should share a point of view about issues and should influence others to get involved in an issue. But people, especially younger people, can smell fakeness a mile away – and they aren’t afraid to call anyone out on it. Once a business develops and expresses a belief system, it must follow through on that point of view in a real, authentic way. Audi may believe that progress equals gender equality, but they need to commit to demonstrating how that belief connects the dots across all facets of their organization. Actions Are More Important Than Words Saying you believe in something is easy. Showing, unequivocally, that you believe something is much harder. During Super Bowl LI, we saw through advertising that Airbnb has a strong point of view about what acceptance means: “No matter who are you are, where you’re from, who you love, or who you worship, we all belong.” But #weaccept is an idea that is bigger than words on a screen. Airbnb is taking action by setting a goal to provide housing for 100,000 people in need, and they’re contributing $4 million to the International Rescue Committee to help support displaced populations globally. Those are actions that speak louder than words.  Prepare to Engage Having a point of view on something sometimes means defending it. There will always be people who oppose a position – that’s the nature of opinions. For companies, this translates to having an engagement strategy when their belief system is under scrutiny or attack. When Honey Maid underscored wholesome as inclusive of same-sex and interracial families, some people didn’t like it. The brand reacted to that opposition by physically turning that negativity in something positive. Honey Maid may have anticipated that taking a stand would elicit some backlash, so they devised a strategy to reinforce their point of view. Developing and maintaining a point of view is hard work for any organization. But we believe, when done well, it can fuel a major source of differentiation across a crowded, noisy landscape. As writer Elie Wiesel, once said: “The opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference.” When companies or brands lack a clear point of view, the net effect can often feel a lot like indifference.

I suggest one more guideline to your excellent list: Build on a foundation of emotional connection with your customers. The brands that have been able to express POVs effectively — Starbucks, Nike, Dove — have done so in part because they have already established an emotional connection with their customers and they use their values messages to further that connection. It seems more difficult for a brand to jump from a very rational, product-centric appeal to a strong social message without having already demonstrated customer empathy and establishing a level of trust and resonance with its customers — connections that are built over time. — denise lee yohn Jack Lichtenstein I hate to seem “old school,” but I look for the “very rational, product-centric appeal.” I am happy with any company that will provide me with a product or service that has the features I need, that does not need lines of disclaimers in their ads, and that will allow me to speak with a human when I need to. I have not seen many companies with points of view that are abhorrent, and so I don’t much care about their efforts to engage me with themes that are developed by teams of marketers to play on emotions and that are, in any case, completely irrelevant to my decision to purchase that good or service. In my professional life, I am a consultant in business and government policy. My clients are interested in my ability to provide sound advice. One of the last things any of them is interested in is whether my political or social beliefs align completely with theirs and make them feel good. In fact, I have to be able to provide them with unalloyed advice about the effects of their actions and stands on various issues (their actual policies and actions as opposed to those that appear in advertisements). For me, if a company provides a good product or service, does not lie or mislead in its communications, and otherwise treats its customers and others with respect, it is fulfilling its part of the social contract. Jack — thank you for your comment. It’s a good reminder that different approaches resonate with different customers — further, it makes me realize I should have clarified that a company must offer a good product and value to customers before reaching for these higher-order connections — having a POV does not make up for having a poor product. Thanks again. — denise lee yohn eric solomon Agree with Denise — and thank you for the comment, Jack! I don’t think what you’re saying is “old school” at all; I believe many people would agree. Adding onto Denise’s comment, however, in cluttered categories where many offerings are more or less at parity, establishing emotional connections and/or proving a strong point of view can help to build saliency, potentially leading to the notion that people are making ‘rational’ decisions to buy or use something even when guided by less logical or conscious motivations. When it comes to aligning to points of view, I think younger people are likely more persuaded by companies that stand out by having something to say. Thanks again for the comment- Eric Jack Lichtenstein Thank you, Denise and Eric. Herewith my last comment on the issue. Your points are cogent and well taken. I completely accept an effort by a business to establish emotional connections where “…many offerings are more or less at parity…”. I am not certain that many offerings are often at parity, but your basic point certainly is valid. Many years ago, a classmate of mine and I started a forum on corporate social responsibility at the Harvard Business School where we were then MBA candidates. Our concern was that businesses conduct their affairs toward their customers, workers, shareholders, communities and others in a responsible and ethical manner. When a company has reached that threshold, then I believe they have a right, and some would say a responsibility, to weigh in on issues that are tangential to their core business. They always should have their own house in order first. Otherwise, an embrace of societal issues seems little more than especially cynical dimension of the marketing mix. Best wishes to you.

(LiPo Ching/Bay Area News Group) By Dana Hull, Bloomberg News | Mercury News, Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: March 4, 2017 at 9:51 am | UPDATED: March 5, 2017 at 5:44 am Tesla is losing key personnel as it races to bring the Model 3 — its most critical electric sedan yet — to market later this year. Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler’s impending departure, announced just 15 months after he joined Tesla from Google, will be the latest in a raft of largely under-the-radar exits. Former executives, who spoke on the condition they not be identified, cited a range of reasons for their exits over the past year, including long hours in the rush to high-volume production, mission creep, and a tense culture that reflects their visionary but indefatigable chief executive officer, Elon Musk. “Tesla looks like a company that is getting stretched to the limit,” said Dave Sullivan, an analyst at industry researcher AutoPacific. “The pressure of getting out the Model 3 is getting to everybody, from the people on the factory floor to the people at the top.” A Tesla spokesman in an emailed statement called attracting and retaining talent “one of our biggest assets” and said the company’s attrition rate was below average among technology companies. Long hours and job-hopping are routine at tech companies in California’s Silicon Valley, and Palo Alto-based Tesla continues to make high-profile hires. Even so, analysts have flagged the departures as a risk to what will be Tesla’s most challenging execution year in its short history. Musk plans to introduce the Model 3, is starting battery production at the Gigafactory and will integrate SolarCity, the recent acquisition that pushed Tesla’s global workforce to roughly 30,000 people. Like many companies, Tesla noted among risk factors in its just-filed annual report that it needs to attract and retain skilled workers. This year, however, it added a new phrase to the boilerplate, saying the efforts are needed “especially to support our expansion plans and ramp to high-volume manufacture of vehicles.” Risk Factors “Any time you’re going through a big change it’s important to have consistent management,” Colin Langan, a UBS analyst who has a sell rating on the stock, said in an interview. “Jason Wheeler was a big hire and he’s leaving, and there have been many other departures. If you’re putting out aggressive targets and the people aren’t there to meet them, it’s a problem.” Wheeler, whose departure was first announced on last week’s quarterly earnings call, said he wants to pursue work in public policy and praised what he called the “A-team” at Tesla. Deepak Ahuja, the CFO who led Tesla from the brink of bankruptcy through its 2010 initial public offering and retired in 2015, will return in April for a second tour of duty. Bloomberg News compiled a list of more than two dozen management departures over the past year that include vice presidents of finance, communications, regulatory affairs, production, manufacturing, products and programs. Recently, Tesla lost Mark Lipscomb, VP of human resources, and Satish Jeyachandran, its director of hardware engineering. Leadership Opacity Tesla is generally opaque about its leadership beyond Musk and Chief Technical Officer J.B. Straubel, with no list of executives or vice presidents on its website, its investor relations page or in the annual report the company filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Among Tesla’s senior leadership team, three quarters have more than three years of tenure, 60 percent have been with the company at least six years and 20 percent have worked there a decade, according to the spokesman. Almost 60 percent of those who’ve had a leadership position at Tesla over its 14-year existence are still with the company, Tesla said. None of the former managers Bloomberg News reached agreed to speak on the record. Goldman Sachs Group this week downgraded Tesla to sell from neutral, with analyst David Tamberrino casting doubt on its ability to deliver the Model 3 on time. The Feb. 27 report contributed to the shares dropping about 11 percent from their 19-month closing high of $280.98 on Feb. 14. Of 23 analysts tracked by Bloomberg, eight have buy ratings on the shares, nine are neutral and six recommend selling. Tesla’s shares have jumped about 29 percent over the past year and closed at $251.57 Friday. Revenue surged 73 percent to more than $7 billion in 2016. Recent Departures When Tesla announced in January it hired Chris Lattner from Apple Inc. as vice president of Autopilot software, it didn’t mention that Sterling Anderson, the executive who ran the entire Autopilot program and reported directly to Musk, departed in late December. Tesla then sued Anderson, alleging he broke his confidentiality agreement with the company. Aurora Innovation LLC, the company Anderson started with the former head of Google’s self-driving project, said it would fight the “meritless” lawsuit. Several former Tesla employees have landed at other auto companies, including Future Mobility Corp., Nio and Waymo, the self-driving car business spun off by Google parent Alphabet Inc. To be sure, Tesla’s clean-energy mission and compelling products has attracted high-caliber people, regardless of its hard-driving reputation. The 45-year-old Musk has described himself as a “nano manager,” has kept a sleeping bag at the company’s car factory and works a second job running a rocket company. About half of Musk’s roughly $11.6 billion in estimated wealth comes from Tesla, where he takes no salary but is the largest shareholder with a 21 percent stake. Growing Headcount As of Dec. 31, Tesla had about 17,800 employees, not counting another 12,200 added with the $2 billion acquisition of SolarCity last year. Despite the growing headcount, more than 2,000 job postings at Tesla are listed on the recruiting website Taleo. Tesla produced almost 84,000 vehicles in 2016 and plans to make half a million in 2018, then 1 million in 2020. It expects to pick locations for more gigafactories by the end of this year, and to introduce a semi truck and bus. Earlier this week it was named the highest-ranked domestic car brand by Consumer Reports magazine. One worker at Tesla’s Fremont auto plant touched off a unionization effort last month, publishing a Medium post describing 60- to 70-hour work weeks, safety-related issues and mandatory overtime. The unionization talk has drawn pushback from Musk. He promised employees free frozen yogurt stands, an electric pod-car roller coaster connecting parking lots to the factory and a “really amazing party once Model 3 reaches volume production later this year,” according to an internal email Buzzfeed obtained last month. Musk’s moves to lighten the environment show the union threat has registered, AutoPacific’s Sullivan said. “If Tesla has more than 2,000 job openings, does that mean that people are overloaded, or doubling up? You can’t constantly ask for the impossible.” Tags:  Tesla Dana Hull, Bloomberg News Subscribe Today!

In my experience, particularly in our business, there tends to be a much greater disparity between when things are invented, announced, or “demonstrated” and when they actually get rolled out on any major scale in the consumer market. That has certainly been the case with “OTT,” and I’ve been saying that for many years; yes, it’s coming, yes, it’s going to be an alternative delivery path by new aggregators for video, and yes, the technology will improve to the point where it may get to be as good at delivering video as cable is today. But no, it’s not here yet, and it’s still going to take some time. What I am referring to in the title of today’s column is not whether or when OTT video delivery becomes “mainstream.” That will still be some time off, if ever. What I’m referring to is that we appear to have reached a critical point in corporate decisionmaking regarding the course to take regarding OTT. All you have to do is recount what has happened over the past year to appreciate the issue.  We now have Netflix, Hulu, Sony’s Playstation Vue, AT&T’s DirectTV Now, Dish’s Sling Network, FuboTV, and the newly announced, but long anticipated Google YouTubeTV coming on the scene. They all have significant hurdles to still overcome. For instance you have to read the Google announcement very carefully to understand, or maybe get confused as to whether they are really going to deliver the four “major networks” to their subscribers for $35 a month. I think a careful reading says no, they are delivering “programming” from those networks, but not the network itself, and they will deliver “local news” from network affiliates, but not the network feed. Of course Google also says it is going to roll out this new service first in major metropolitan areas, so they could use the “retranstenna” approach and have folks simply pick up the local digital broadcast feeds off the air. Anything is possible. So here’s the challenge; for companies like Comcast, which already have incredibly well-developed distribution systems and program aggregation contracts, as well as the clear capability with their X-1 platform to distribute OTT, should they take the plunge now? Should they respond to the growing gaggle of nascent competitors by rolling out their own nationwide service? Or on the other hand, if those other services (and we can expect more from the likes of Amazon and Apple) don’t really have the packages they try to imply, or are low-balling their introductory prices—but the margins are way too slim and the assumption that ad revenue will make up the difference may work for Google but few others—is it better not to redirect the market and stick with what we already know works? Naturally, the decision will also significantly affect other MVPDs in a major way. But one thing we know for sure: the broadband supplier in the local market is still the only way to get all that video the “last mile,” so as I have said repeatedly, maintaining your plant and you customer service is going to be the ultimate winning strategy. In the meantime, however, the “big” guys like Comcast and Charter are going to have to decide, as are the new entrants. For them, the issue is whether they put money into distribution or product, which is going to make the most difference? None of this is clear, but decision time is near.   share this article previous storyYouTube TV next storyUnivision & Charter Featured Stories <   > Featured Stories Programming Advertising Forecast Programming Nick Upfront Programming Disney’s Pyne to Exit Programming Univision & Charter Programming From Viacom CEO Programming February Ratings Related Stories Programming Comings & Goings Programming Paramount Network Watch Programming Ratings The Latest Programming Room to Grow: Comcast’s Smit… Programming Retrans Ruckus: DISH Loses Hearst… Programming Comings & Goings Programming Upfront & Center: NBCU Talking… Programming Decision Time Programming Charter CFO: Wireless, Digital Migration… Programming Cablefax Announces Top Lawyers 2017 Programming Comcast-NBCU Investments Get cable industry news in your inbox, daily!

Gadget Hacks Android Hacks WonderHowTo Gadget Hacks Next Reality Invisiverse Driverless Null Byte Android Basics Glossary of Terms Galaxy S8 Rumors HTC 11 Rumors Everything Pixel Rooting Guide Gaming Roundups Forum Stay Secure How-Tos News How To: Enable NetGuard's Hidden Ad-Blocking Feature on Android By Amboy Manalo Fri 2:45 PM Enable NetGuard's Hidden Ad-Blocking Feature on Android NetGuard is a well-established app known for its highly secure firewall, which blocks unwanted web activity from individual apps that can take up both precious bandwidth and battery life. Not quite as well known, however, is the fact there's a second official version of NetGuard that comes with a hidden ad-blocking feature, which can be activated with just a little tinkering in the app's settings menu. Unfortunately, Google doesn't allow ad-blocking apps on the Play Store that block ads in Chrome or other core Google apps, so this more comprehensive version of NetGuard has to be sideloaded. But that's as simple as enabling "Unknown sources" in Android's Settings menu, then downloading an APK to install. Aside from that, we'll cover the process of turning on NetGuard's hidden ad-blocking feature below. Don't Miss: How to Use NetGuard's Firewall Features to Keep Data-Hungry Apps in Check Step 1: Install NetGuard First thing's first, uninstall the Play Store version of NetGuard, if you already have it. Then head to the following link and download the latest version of the more advanced NetGuard. Once that's finished, tap the Download complete notification, then press "Install" when prompted. Download the ad-blocking version of NetGuard from GitHub (.apk) Step 2: Enable NetGuard's VPN Service Open NetGuard, then tap the toggle switch at the top of the screen to enable the app's VPN service. This is how it blocks ads and filters other traffic, so tap "OK" when asked to turn on the VPN. Step 3: Turn on NetGuard's Ad Blocker After that, tap the three-dot menu button in the top-right corner of the app, then go to "Settings." From there, enable the Filter traffic entry under the Advanced options menu. While you're in here, make sure that Block domain names is also switched on, though it should be already. Go back to the app's main Settings menu and tap on "Backup," then select "Download hosts file." Wait a few seconds until that's completed, then open Chrome and head to its settings menu by tapping on the three-dot menu button in the upper-right corner. From there, scroll down and find "Data Saver," then make sure to turn this feature off if it isn't already. Note that is may take up to 10 minutes before you'll stop seeing ads, in order to let the Android DNS cache time out. Step 4: Verify That Ad Blocking Works Now that you've got everything set up, you'll want to verify that the ad blocking feature is working. So head to the following link, which tests your phone to see if ad blocking is enabled. If you see a message saying "Ad blocking works," then you're all set to go. Test NetGuard's ad-blocking feature here After running the test, feel free to confirm on your own. Go to a news site, as they tend to be laden with ads and sponsored content. You'll know the ad-blocking feature is fully working when you no longer see any extra content on the bottom of your favorite articles. Please note that this feature will not block ads that are not domain-based, so apps like YouTube will still have ads even with NetGuard installed. And now that you have a great non-root ad blocking solution, we recommend that you support your favorite developers in other ways, such as donating on GitHub or buying an in-app purchase or two. Nonetheless, let us know what you think of NetGuard in the comments section below.

Events Other Industry Events Jobs More About Mumbrella Freelance Directory Business Directory Advertise Subscribe to newsletter News After IAB claims ad fraud of just 4%, marketer speaking at their conference cites overseas study’s 80% figure March 2, 2017 5:58 by Vivienne Kelly 15 Minutes after industry body the Interactive Advertising Bureau published a report claiming that only 4% of traffic delivered to ads in Australia was fraudulent, a panel at a conference curated by the organisation was told that the number could be 80%. This morning, the IAB, which represents publishers carrying and delivering ads such as Google, Yahoo7, Facebook and Nine, released its first report into ad fraud, and claimed more than 96% of ads served to desktop and mobiles are served to real users. But in a session curated and moderated by the IAB’s CEO Vijay Solanki at today’s Programmatic Summit in Sydney about viewability, ad blocking and ad fraud, Michelle Katz, a former director of acquisition at Optus said ad fraud was a major issue. And the boss of tech provider Rubicon suggested that “self interest” was getting in the way of addressing the problem. Chris Nolan, Libby Minogue, Michelle Katz and Ricky Mulla at the Programatic Summit Referencing a global study Katz said: “For me, ad fraud is a real concern, because once again, it’s just an element of ‘Are we really getting what we paid for?’ And I know that the [World] Federation of Advertisers has done some studies and in some cases, the numbers are quite scary – they’re potentially up to 80% of clicks that could be received are actually fraudulent.” The issues, according to REA Group’s executive GM for media and marketing, Libby Minogue, are “causing so much confusion in the industry and it’s doing such a huge amount of damage to our industry in terms of that next phase of growth”. The responsibility for this however, may lie with publishers, she said, who have failed to collaborate and provide acceptable standardised metrics. “From a publisher perspective, it’s really hard to move ahead and really drive substantial revenue growth that we’ve had previously. So there’s pressure coming from the board below. They still expect the growth rates in digital specifically in digital media that’s double digit. Unless you are Facebook or Google, that is so much harder for all of us. And that’s because of the complexity that we’ve placed upon ourselves. And having no clear metrics is what is holding us back.” Publishers may have created the problem, but creative agencies will play a key part in solving the digital industry’s trust issues with brands, and will need to work hard to do it, she said. Related Content Less than 4% of digital ads in Australia are fraudulent, claims IAB News IAB study claims 27% of Australians use adblocking technology News “I think creative agencies are imperative to helping be a part of the solution – only because we all talk about the tech, but no one is talking about the quality of the creative that they’re putting out there in the market. And that speaks to fraudulent ads, it speaks to every level. So it’s strategic thinking and it’s creativity and there’s been a lot around that at the moment. “So we can blame the technology, but we’ve really got to have a good hard look at ourselves and the creative that we’re putting out in the market.” The biggest challenge, however will be removing self-interest from the equation, and motivating brands, publishers, platforms and agencies to come together to tackle the issue, Rick Mulla, MD of Rubicon Project Japan and APAC said. “We love guys like yourself [the IAB] who are trying to put these standards together, but even then – and again not to call you out on it – but it’s hard, there’s still self-interest at play and it’s still kind of heavy hitters there and it’s hard to get an agreement on where these measurements should be,” he told Solanki. “And those measurements already have a lot of self-interest when you look at the final definition of things. If you look at the definition of viewability, it’s pretty low… I think we can aspire to do better than that, but it’s going to be very hard to get to that point.” Chris Nolan, COO of Publicis Media ANZ said the solution would lie in media agencies putting competition aside to tackle the viewability issue. “Unfortunately, I think the media agency landscape is very competitive,” he told the panel. “There’s a lot of us all looking for an edge and all looking for a competitive edge and unfortunately many of these topics [viewability, ad fraud and ad blocking] have landed in the competitive space. And that’s unfortunate, because what it’s done is it’s lead to a lot of confusion in the market. “So agencies will talk to different standards, will use different technology platforms – and I think that’s made it really difficult for publishers and for clients to understand, ‘Well what should we set as our viewability standard? And when we use the word ‘viewability’, what do we actually mean?’ Because people are using it competitively and using it to create an edge. Some will talk to viewability as a page, and others will talk to viewability as for an ad.” Related Content IAB says marketers need more support adopting fraud detection and viewability technologies News Impact Radius puts ad fraud in sights with opening of first Australian office News He said the constant need for clients to read the fine print to understand what publishers are spruiking and how they’re measuring it, was undermining confidence in the industry. Agencies will have to work together to restore the lost trust, he said. “Let’s just find some common ground around things such as viewability, I think we’ll really be able to build confidence in the medium, confidence in the service we provide – and then we can all go and compete on delivering outcomes for our campaigns which I think is ultimately what you want us to do.” Vivienne Kelly topics ad fraud, ad viewability, Chris Nolan, digital publishing, Facebook, Google, IAB, Interactive Advertising Bureau, Libby Minogue, Michelle Katz, Publicis Media, REA Group, Rubicon Project, viewability, Vijay Solanki Share Tweet Share Comments: 15 Add Comment Michelle Katz 2 Mar 17 Hi Vivienne, When I made the comment re ad fraud at 80% I refered to research commented on by the ‘World Federation of Advertisers’, I was not referring to ad fraud rates in Australia. Thanks Michelle Reply Miranda Ward 3 Mar 17 Hi Michelle, Thanks – we have popped World into the quote in an effort to clarify your comments. Cheers, Miranda – Mumbrella Reply MP 3 Mar 17 Maybe you should put it somewhere in the article title and edm subject line to really make it clear Miranda……. Reply Marshawn 3 Mar 17 Needs to have a distinction about the numbers written into this article and headline please. 4% is impression fraud, the comment about 80% is related to click fraud. Completely different types of fraud from a naming and also technical point of view. Reply Spot on 3 Mar 17 The IAB can hold these fancy conferences and talk about the need for transparency but the fact is they just aren’t keeping up. The IAB in Australia is going backwards and dominated by News Corp influences. Nielsen are slow, unable to track digital metrics like on platforms apps, social media content and simply not transparent in their methodology tracking. The organisation is beholden to the IAB. It’s basically seen as a big slow government department. Would not be surprised if sites started to pull out. Reply Ricky bobby 3 Mar 17 No wonder us digital folk are laughed at, 4% to 80%. Give some perspective you fool, when was the 80% discovered? What was purchased? I can go find 80% of fraud right now if I wanted to, it’s easy to find(and cheap) but bloody easy to avoid thanks to the self interest of vendors and technologies aimed to cut it out. When marketers stop making things about price and forcing agencies and partners to drive low low low cpms or viewable cpms whatever it may be, the crap fraud will disappear. Chris Nolan, what publishers talk about viewabilty as a page and not the ad/impression? I say, go talk to new publishers mate! You and the agency are easily fooled if that’s your biggest concern and you are unable to overcome that. Don’t bother setting a new viewability standard, as per the other panel member start engaging creative agencies and ensure ads are worth watching first. Poor publisher will always be the punching bag, and no matter how you design a page to force a view the user always has the final say in giving the ad and content the flick. Reply OpsInsider 3 Mar 17 Ultimately you can skin a cat a number of ways, not every way will turn out the same. What we have seen as a result of this example is the inconsistencies in the measurement of fraud. Unfortunately publishing that provides a different perception of what reality is. Think you’ll find that IAB’s study covers premium top tier publishers in Australia, without considering anything travelling through the pipelines of the ecosystem. It is the priority of the IAB to present publishers and media owners. 4% in premium environments is not a great outcome. Reply Oh please! 3 Mar 17 The IAB were talking about traffic, in Australia. Michelle was talking about clicks, from an international study. Reply Botty McBotFace 3 Mar 17 The only conclusion that can be reached when figures as disparate as 4% – 80% are being reported is that NOONE has any f-ing idea about ad fraud Reply Nick 3 Mar 17 Hi Vivenne Noticed that you have edited the quote and included WORLD. Would it also be worth mentioning that IAB report is claiming that only 4% of traffic delivered to ads in AUSTRALIA was fraudulent and making the headline of your article clearer. I read the headline and thought that Michelle was referring that 80% of traffic delivered to Australia was fraudulent. Good article regardless, and agree that Fraud is an important topic that needs to be prioritised and all are responsible for finding a solution Out of interest, do any of the studies undertaken by the World Federation of Advertisers include a percentage specific to Australia. Would be an interesting follow up looking at Ad Fraud rates of various countries… Reply Roi 3 Mar 17 Relying on these metrics is a fools game anyway, there’s a reason they called vanity metrics. Sure some of the big brands just want reach and branding but for everyone else if the ads don’t create sales and make a profit what the hell is the point? I’ve never noticed a big problem with Ad fraud probably because I Target my campaigns and measure the results rather than trying to get 5 million people to simply and wastefully see my ad. Reply Gai Le Roy 3 Mar 17 There are two very different things being referenced here: The new IAB Australia data is 3 months worth of all AU ad inventory (ad impressions) from late 2016 tracked by 3 MRC accredited vendors (ComScore, IAS, Moat) – collected and validated by PwC. This is a measure for all invalid traffic (includes fraud but not exclusive to fraud) for this inventory. We will be publishing this data every 6 months in the market to monitor trends. Michelle references a small academic study that tested clicks on a £400 budget from the UK two years ago that was referenced within a WFA paper – if anyone wants to look at this study it can be found here – http://oxford-biochron.com/dow.....Report.pdf Reply What a waste of valuable lifetime 3 Mar 17 You’re comparing impression fraud in Australia in 2017 (or the quasi lack thereof) with a tiny and out-dated UK study (with a rather questionable test design) and you create an infuriating click bait headline. Reply Sam G 6 Mar 17 Yep, this is quite misleading and sensationalist reporting. And it does a disservice to the industry. The minor edits after blasting out an eDM really are too little too late. If you work in the Aus media industry – read the links Gai posted above and make your own professional judgement in each’s application and robustness. On a separate note, it is a little bewildering that at the conference an IAB board member would asked for publishers to work better together to come up with common metrics on the same day that the same major publishers (via IAB) released common metrics that they have collaborated on over many months. Reply Terri Smythe 3 Mar 17 This article is poor and I suspect that the journalist is covertly undermining a competitive industry event. This is a shame, utterly self-serving and good for no-one in advertising. The comments from the REA representative referencing creative agencies and their role in fraud is utter nonsense. How do these people end up on stage in public?

Also: a guide to content marketing best-practices on LinkedIn; measuring success on Snapchat; B2B leads via Facebook ads; and much more... Skim to stay in the know! 1. YouTube aims to kill cable with announcement of YouTubeTV Google/Alphabet's YouTube on Tuesday took a big foray into television territory with the announcement of YouTubeTV, a new TV subscription service, set to launch in the next couple of months in the US. YouTubeTV looks to take advantage of Americans' increasing propensity to cutting the cable TV cord. YouTube is offering unlimited access to a set of over 40 networks, including USA, FX, ESPN, Fox Sports, and more—starting at just $35 per month. Subscribers will be able to stream to various devices, including their televisions using Chromecast. In short, users will be able to tune into their favorite shows on their own terms, on their preferred device. The TV space is getting more interesting by the minute as social giants test what approach works to their advantage in upending the traditional TV paradigm. Will you (have you?) cut the cord? 2. A modern guide to content marketing on LinkedIn Adweek dives into the world of social media with in-depth looks at content marketing on the "four big platforms. Up this week: LinkedIn. If your company's content on LinkedIn can help users further their goals of building their personal brand, finding business prospects, or looking for jobs, you'll likely succeed. From the basics of building functional content that creates value, to keys to creating mobile-optimized, sponsored content and pushing it via sophisticated targeting and InMail, LinkedIn can prove to be the most effective platform for building leads and product awareness. See how now. 3. All businesses can now run ads on Instagram Stories Facebook-owned photo and video sharing social network Instagram has not held its punches to ensure its Snapchat Stories clone, Instagram Stories, succeeds. The company launched the Stories feature in August 2016 and announced in January that it was testing full-screen ads with 30 global brands; it's now ready to roll out the red carpet for all businesses. All companies will be able to place ads between users' Stories in the next few weeks, with the primary key performance indicator being reach, which Instagram says the ad format is optimized for.

Facebook takes mid-roll ad testing to new heights The social network, looking to create new revenue streams, is expanding its trial of in-stream video ads beyond Facebook Live broadcasts, and creeping into the world of videos from publishers. Facebook is testing the ads, which only appear after at least 20 seconds of a video has played, with a small number of US publishers, and letting them keep 55% of the ad revenue. Mid-roll ads could also change how content creators produce videos for the platform: Brands might eventually need to build suspense in their video content to make sure it maintains viewers' interest through ad breaks. Challenge accepted. 5. It looks like Facebook's Reactions are finally catching on It's been just over one year since the social network introduced alternatives to the "Like" button. They seemed slow to take off, but Facebook can now count over 300 billion reactions used on posts in the past year. "Love" was the reaction most used, clocking in with over half of the total use of Reactions, and Mexico was the country that used Reactions most. The US stood at number eight, behind Greece, Chile, and Suriname, among others. 6. Periscope Producer now available to all Streaming just got easier for all Periscope users, with the Twitter-owned company announcing the release of Periscope Producer for mobile and Web users—on iOS and Android. The feature allows users to stream to Periscope from external devices other than phones and tablets. Users can now employ professional cameras, streaming software, or hardware encoders to share live broadcasts with the world. Anyone can now broadcast with Periscope Producer - available on Android, iOS and web! ??????https://t.co/xwnkrVYdPy — Periscope Help (@periscopehelp) February 23, 2017 7. How to measure your brand's success on Snapchat We've often discussed why Snapchat could be a great platform for your brand, but Snapchat's insights leave much to be desired. That doesn't mean your company should be snapping away without some important benchmarks in mind, of course. Recent data from Snapalytics provides key insights into how brands are performing on Snapchat, from how users are finding their accounts to how many snaps brands are adding to their stories on average per month. We've highlighted some of the most important takeaways here, but catch our coverage of the report for an in-depth look! Usernames are key: 64% of followers found a brand account by username, with 25% and 9% arriving based on Snapcodes and deep links, respectively. Story averages: Brands post, on average, 13 stories per month to their account Content balance: Brands focus almost equally on static images and videos in their Stories, with videos taking a slight lead. 8. Why and how B2Bs must get more social A new report from eMarketer suggests that although B2B brands are getting on board social media, they lack expertise. Brands need to do some more research via the insights available on social platforms to truly understand users' buyer behavior before executing social media campaigns, the report suggests. Companies can perform social listening and data mining to get to the bottom of their audiences' behavior and ensure they're delivering their messages on the right platform at the optimal time. But B2B companies are hesitant to use social monitoring tools, with only 39% reporting they use them. Unfortunately, companies that don't make analyzing their potential customers' usage habits, channel preferences, and consumption patterns will ultimately fail in their social media strategy a they're not aligned with the buyer journey. Take a listen below for more! 9. Dive into livestreaming, but follow these best-practices As much as social networks clearly want it to be, livestreaming might truly be the next big thing, so brands should experiment to see whether it makes sense for them. Before jumping in, however, we have some rock solid guidelines to make sure your company's first live broadcast doesn't go off the rails and instead generates real-time engagement that builds awareness and influences audiences. Covered in detail: setting up a livestream "war room," establishing dedicated support for during and after the live event, preparing an easy-to-use CMS tool and possibly building in a slight delay, drafting and communicating set guidelines for your team, and more... 10. How B2B brands can generate leads via Facebook Ads The success of ads depends on how well their content conforms to the media they're running on, and how well they serve the objectives of its users. Advertisement network Adlove has created an infographic dedicated to B2B-ers hoping to make a splash with their Facebook ads. Covered in detail: promoting content to the target department, retargeting viewers with a hook, referral asking to get warm prospects, and qualifying and entering the sales cycle. Click through to discover all the great insights: 11. Campaign optimization: Which social platforms to use and when Posting the "right" content on the wrong social network can lead to bad sentiment from users and headaches for brands, so matching the strengths and weaknesses of each platform with the goals and objectives of your company can go miles in optimizing your campaigns. From which social network makes the most sense for nitty-gritty targeting or app-install campaigns, to which lends its hand best at shifting perceptions about products and which is imperative for influencer campaigns, MarketingProfs has a top-notch breakdown of which social platform you should be using and when. 12. We'll wrap with the Supreme Court's big decision on sexual predators and social media The US Supreme Court could soon whip up a controversial debate that pits free speech rights on social media against a state's law pertaining to sex offenders. The Supreme Court last week suggested it might strike down a North Carolina law that makes it illegal for registered sex offenders to use social networks that allow minors to have accounts. At least five justices on the Supreme Court cast doubt on the North Carolina law, saying that given the prevalence of social media today, offenders would be cut off from a crucial channel of communication and large marketplace of ideas, and that the First Amendment also includes the right to receive information. A final decision by the Court is expected in June. Join over 600,000 marketing professionals, and gain access to thousands of marketing resources! Don't worry ... it's FREE! WANT TO READ MORE?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ARVR Guest The VR industry needs better content, turns to accelerators Amir-Esmaeil Bozorgzadeh@whiteboxamir March 4, 2017 8:02 AM Tags: Amir-Esmaeil Bozorgzadeh Above: Realities Centre office, London The VR industry finds itself positioned this year somewhere in what Gartner’s Hype Cycle refers to as the trough of disillusionment. This is a time where, as it gains momentum, the industry needs to rally together and push its ecosystem to the next stage of market adoption. The established hardware players like HTC, Oculus, Google, and Samsung have the most at stake and the most to lose, but it’s the startup community that’s driving market adoption by creating content that’s strong enough to attract users to adopt the necessary gear. The fate of both are inextricably tied, and the powers that be know it. Case in point: Facebook committed $250 million last October to specifically fund VR content in addition to a previous $250 million pledged by Oculus. That, alongside the pool of funds that HTC, Colopl, IMAX, and The Venture Reality Fund have put into play, marks content as a particular priority. The hardware players will need to take a hard look at the library of content that is being churned out by creators and figure out what strategy they need to take in order to minimize cases of underwhelming content, which is the industry’s biggest threat. First-time users trying out VR content and not feeling compelled to repeat the experience is a big problem. Part of the reason why the ‘replayability’ factor is so low is because VR content creators aren’t investing enough time or using the right tools and resources to properly vet their ideas as they evolve into market-ready products. That’s where accelerators and incubators come in, the first wave of which includes the likes of Boost VC, Tokyo VR Startups, Seoul VR Startups, UCCVR, and HTC’s ViveX. Above: Tokyo VR Startups Demo Day – June 2016 “There’s incredible entrepreneurial interest and dynamism across the globe for VR/AR; thus it’s really the best time to offer a dedicated platform to help them accelerate,” Marco DeMiroz, general partner at The Venture Reality Fund, told me. The VR/AR-specialized VC targets early-stage startups and actively supports accelerators and incubators, including all of the ones just mentioned above, by mentoring their cohorts. Relative newcomers that are launching VR accelerators and incubators this year include the Realities Centre in London, the VRBASE in Amsterdam and Berlin, and Oarsis in Madrid. I expect more accelerators to spring up around the globe over the next couple of years as I fail to see a better or more attractive model for churning out a large quantity of high quality startups within a short span of time. “Google, Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Facebook, etc all have huge VR/AR programs and product lines. There is more than ever the need to accelerate innovation and startups which are supporting those products and services,” Thomas Gere, cofounder and CEO at Realities Centre, told me. Accelerators promise to push VR/AR content forward in four key ways: 1. Reducing uncertainty. We’re talking about a new medium here that upsets many of the old-world rules of how we go about storytelling. How do we direct the gaze of the audience in volumetric space? How do we design user interfaces that take up to six degrees of freedom into account? A variety of completely new problems come into play when building immersive content. “Starting a company is hard. Starting a company that uses frontier tech that advances at an exponentially increasing pace is multiple times harder,” Carlos López, CEO at Oarsis, told me. Accelerator and incubator programs are designed with uncertainty as the working premise, and the structure of the curriculum is oriented with that in mind at every step. The more uncertain the ground beneath their feet, the more startup founders need to take refuge in following lean and resource-efficient models and methods for ideation and validation in order to hopefully crack the code on what the best product-market fit is for their concepts. Above: Boost VC office — San Mateo, Calif. 2. Pooling brain power. “It’s extremely useful having these teams working in the same space as we can share our experiences, technical knowledge and give valuable feedback to one another as we develop our products,” Dominic Barnard, Cofounder at VirtualSpeech, explained. His startup just started the Boost VC program two weeks ago to take its public speaking and language learning lineup to the next stage of adoption. 3. Opening access to hardware. Another necessity to VR/AR startups is exposure and access to devices and periphery hardware, which is increasingly expanding in scope, constantly shuffling in specs, and often out of reach for the simple reason of affordability. 4. Community building. Accelerators are also needed at this stage in the industry because, like VR/AR coworking spaces, they are at the heart of the grassroots community and can serve as a sort of neutral ground for the community to build relationships with stakeholders like corporates, venture capital, and the government, all of whom have the same common interest: to get the VR industry off the ground and into the mainstream. Amir-Esmaeil Bozorgzadeh is the cofounder at Virtuleap, a sandbox for creative developers to showcase their VR concepts. He is also the European Partner at Edoramedia, a games publisher and digital agency with headquarters in Dubai. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Slashdot reader Atticus Rex writes: On Monday, W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) director Tim Berners-Lee released a post defending his decision to allow Netflix, Microsoft, Apple and Google to enshrine DRM in Web standards, arguing that blocking it would be pointless. Zak Rogoff, FSF campaigns manager, writes in the response: "As Director of the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), Berners-Lee has the ability to block [the DRM proposal] from ratification as an official Web standard... Of course, a refusal to ratify could not immediately stop the use of DRM, but it could meaningfully weaken the position of DRM in the court of public opinion, and put EME proponents Netflix, Microsoft, Apple, and Google on notice that a very prominent figure was willing to stand up to them on behalf of users. Changes in society's technological infrastructure require political movements, not just technological arguments, and political movements benefit greatly from the support of prominent figures." Berners-Lee takes the position that "The web has to be universal, to function at all. It has to be capable of holding crazy ideas of the moment, but also the well polished ideas of the century. It must be able to handle any language and culture. It must be able to include information of all types, and media of many genres. Included in that universality is that it must be able to support free stuff and for-pay stuff, as they are all part of this world. "This means that it is good for the web to be able to include movies, and so for that, it is better for HTML5 to have EME than to not have it." drm html5 internet ← Related Links → FCC Chair Wants Carriers To Block Robocalls From Spoofed Numbers The FSF Is 30 Years Old; Where Should They Go From Here?

Had the W3C not punted on the DRM scheme itself, Berners-Lee's comments would have been legitimate if not what we necessarily wanted. But in failing to standardize DRM, they basically created another <OBJECT> tag - something that's inherently platform and vendor specific, and will never be anything but.

You cannot have an open source implementation of DRM, because anyone can simply modify the code to remove the encryption and make the unencrypted stream available. You can standardise a mechanism for plugging proprietary DRM modules into the web, but you're still reliant on the vendors to provide them for your platform of choice.

Seriously, is this the cliche of the month club and I missed the memo? No, the Internet does not interpret censorship as anything. The Internet is not alive, and the actions taken to distribute works illegally are ultimately taken by people. Also, comparing measures to prevent infringement of copyright, which is merely against laws that are widely applicable throughout the world, with the sometimes very real problems of actual censorship is just a propaganda move designed to attract an emotional response that is not otherwise justified. You're just repeating industry shill "the sky is falling" garbage. Someone who has a different point of view to you is not necessarily a shill. And if there really isn't a problem if we stop creating and distributing new works, why is the vast majority of piracy ripping those new works, instead of just sharing the "orders of magnitude more media than any human could possibly watch" that we already have? Apparently most pirates disagree with you about which work is more valuable. There is no money to be made in trying to scare pirates straight. There IS money in providing a convenient service, and DRM never adds convenience. It would be lovely if that were true, but I have been following this issue for a long time, and the evidence so far seems to say otherwise. How would you run a service like Netflix, which obviously a great many people find more convenient than other models for watching movies and TV shows, without DRM or some other system with a similar effect? You're trying to separate DRM from what makes a useful service and treat the two separately, but they aren't independent issues.

"Selected platforms and devices" is what we get without a standard. We know that because we've tried that for 25 years. How many years could Linux users not access Netflix. When I first got involved with the IETF (web standards group), ActiveX was the popular way to implement DRM. Meaning you could only see the content using Internet Explorer on Windows. Talk about "selected platforms"! Later DRM on the web commonly used Java for a few years, then Flash. Flash-based DRM lasted for many years, and there are still many sites that require the security nightmare known as Flash because that's how they do their DRM. Note in the above paragraph I never used the word "should". This isn't about what publishers "should" do, or what we'd like them to do. It's about what they actually do. What they actually do is require Flash in the best case DRM, and implement the Sony rootkit in other cases. Of course there are almost as many different ways of doing DRM as there are publishers using it - there is no standard. On the other hand, we've long had standards for video and images such as mpeg and jpeg. Are those limited to "selected platforms and devices"? No, the entire point of standardization is that a standard can be implemented on any platform and device. I've personally made the case against DRM to probably 100 of my customers (qho arw publishers) yet so many of them decide to go ahead and use DRM. About half choose a DRM solution that means I can't see their content on my device. Would a rather they each come up with their own incompatible, annoying DRM that doesn't let me view the content, or would I rather they use a compatible, cross-platform standard that anyone can view, developed with input from users? Given the options we actually have, I'd rather be involved in developing a usable standard than have another generation of Flash-based sites and Sony rootkits.

EME is a standardization of HTML hooks that allow portions of a web page to be decoded by a closed source, proprietary, non standardized binary plugin, that the content provider will choose. The difference from the past is that before EME, publishers would force you to install their proprietary plugin. With EME, they'll force you to use the proprietary browser (Chrome) or operating system (Android) that they think will prevent you from downloading their stuff. It's arguably even worse than the Sony rootkit, because you can be forced to use an operating system that has no root access for you but is safe for them.

One approval is for a hardware device - a phone, tablet, dedicated player (e.g. Roku), Blu-ray player, etc. You submit a sample of this hardware, they go over it and OK it, and authorize you to stream to it. This is why the iPhones got Netflix before Android phones. Netflix had to submit just a few iPhone models for approval, so that happened pretty quickly. They had to submit hundreds of Android phone models for approval, so that took some time. The second type of approval is for software players. If you want to stream to a software player running on a general purpose computing device, Hollywood has much more stringent requirements. Their fear is that you'll run another program along-side the streaming video that peeks into the memory containing the decrypted stream, and save stream to disk thus giving you a DRM-free digital copy of the movie. Their "solution" is that the DRM and video decode process has to happen inside an encrypted virtual machine, which then sends each frame directly to the display device. They don't want a native Windows or OS X or Liinux binary which does this because someone could theoretically modify the binary before running to weaken or pierce the encrypted VM. That's why the players are coded in Flash or Silverlight (theoretically you could modify those as well, but it's a lot harder since a new copy of the player is sent when you begin streaming the movie). This insanity is also why playing streamed movies on PC requires much heftier hardware than mobile devices. Because the entire decode process has to happen inside the encrypted VM, you can't take advantage of dedicated video decode hardware built into every GPU since the late 1990s. The entire thing has to be done in software (moreover, software running in a VM). It's extremely CPU-intensive.

If you want me to support an open DRM standard then it needs to be capability based with normal customers like you or me represented as first class owners of those capabilities and implement a durable scheme for transfer of those capabilities into the indefinite future. For example, consider a ownership-based scheme where producers issue N digitally-signed capabilities to a particular copyrighted work and sell them to customers on an electronic marketplace. Bitcoin has proven that it's possible to maintain a globally consistent transaction ledger of ownership of individual tokens, and a much cheaper implementation could maintain ownership and facilitate programmatic transfer of capabilities to digital works (to support sales, gifts, and even temporary loans) because the marginal value of acquiring more than one capability to the same work is zero and so there will be little need to spend gigawatts of electricity maintaining the blockchain against adversaries. The copyrighted work doesn't even have to be encrypted. Just make standards-compliant devices/software require current ownership of a capability to use the work.

The protection is that the content is encrypted with AES. Only a user with the key can decrypt the content.

EME doesn't provide any protection whatsoever against an authorized user ripping the content. That's outside the scope of EME.
