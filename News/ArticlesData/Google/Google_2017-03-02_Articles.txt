By Troy Wolverton | twolverton@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 3, 2017 at 9:30 am | UPDATED: March 6, 2017 at 8:49 am If you’re looking for an alternative to Comcast for pay TV, you’re soon going to have another option. But how long that option, and others, will survive may be up to federal regulators. On Tuesday, YouTube announced it will be entering the pay TV game. The Google-owned company, best known for hosting free-to-watch videos posted by individual creators or pirated from Hollywood media companies, will soon be offering, for a monthly fee, a collection of broadcast and cable TV channels. YouTube is only the latest company to offer a pay TV bundle distributed over the internet. Over the last two years, Dish launched Sling TV; Sony, PlayStation Vue; AT&T, DirecTV Now; and Comcast, Stream TV.

Net neutrality may be under attack next Google’s upcoming pay TV service won’t be the last internet-based pay TV service. Hulu has already announced that it too will begin offering a multi-channel pay TV service later this year. And Apple reportedly has long been eyeing the market. Excluding Comcast’s Stream TV, which is only available in a few areas of the country and is designed largely for in-home use, the new internet pay TV services are all similar. They each offer the same trade-off: You get far fewer channels than you’d get with a typical satellite or cable TV offering, but you’ll pay significantly less and you can cancel at any time. Unlike many traditional pay TV services, you can watch the new services on the device of your choice, be it a tablet, smartphone, computer or television. And to watch on your TV, you typically only need a low-cost digital media player like Google’s Chromecast or one of Roku’s players; you don’t need to rent a costly cable box. YouTube TV will fit right into that mold. At launch, it will offer some 44 channels, including all of the major broadcast networks except PBS. For that, the company will charge just $35 a month. The service will offer notable advantages over its rivals. It will launch with a cloud-based DVR feature, which will allow users to store recordings of programs on Google’s servers. That’s a function Sling TV is still testing and one that DirecTV Now still lacks. YouTube TV users will be able to record as many programs as they want and keep them for up to nine months. By contrast, PlayStation Vue’s cloud DVR deletes recordings after 28 days and the one Sling is testing will only store 100 hours of programming. Another feature that’s likely to please: YouTube TV users will be able to access up to three video streams from the service at a time. So, you could be watching something in the living room while your spouse watches something else in the bedroom and your kid watches a third show in their room. DirecTV Now only allows two concurrent streams and Sling TV’s base offering only permits one stream at a time. But YouTube TV will have some limitations that may make it unattractive. At least for now, the company is saying that if you want to watch it on your TV, you’ll need a Chromecast device or a TV with built-in Chromecast support. If you have a Roku box or Amazon’s Fire TV or an Apple TV, you may be out of luck. Of course, you can pick up a Chromecast for only $35, so that problem is easily solved. What’s likely to be troublesome are the channel options. YouTube TV will include Fox News, ESPN and USA, which are three of the most popular cable channels. But it will be lacking lots of others. Among the missing: TBS, HGTV, TNT, the Discovery and History channels, CNN, AMC and Lifetime. So if you want to watch “The Walking Dead,” “Project Runway” or “Fixer Upper,” you’ll have to look elsewhere. Still, the launch of YouTube TV is something to be excited about, even if its lineup doesn’t match your viewing habits. After years of being stuck with ever pricier television service from a handful of competitors — at best — we now have a growing number of lower-priced options. If you include not just the multi-channel services, but Netflix, HBO Go and the large number of individual cable channels available online, the market for internet-based TV services appears to be growing and thriving. But there’s trouble on the horizon. The business model for these kinds of video services depends on an open internet. Unfortunately, the open internet is very much in question right now, and the big broadband providers — most of which have their own video services that are under threat from the Sling TV’s and YouTube TV’s of the world — have a strong incentive to see it go away. If broadband providers could block video services that competed with their own or slow down their streams to the point where they were unwatchable, they could put rivals out of business. If broadband providers were allowed to charge rivals a toll to access the providers’ customers or ensure a fast connection to them, they could make those rival services unprofitable or prohibitively pricey. Conversely, if broadband providers, many of which limit the amount of data their subscribers can consume in a given month without facing extra charges, can exempt their own internet video services from those data caps while applying them to their rivals, they could give their own services a leg up. If one service eats into your limited data allotment and another, similar service doesn’t, which one are you more likely to use? Those notions may seem alarmist, but Ajit Pai, the new head of the Federal Communications Commission, has made it clear that he’s no fan of an open internet, at least as it’s commonly understood. He’s already given companies like AT&T and Verizon the green light to exempt their own video services from data caps they apply to their rivals. And in a speech Tuesday, he gave his strongest indication yet that he will seek to roll back the FCC’s strong net neutrality rules, which protect the open internet by preventing broadband providers from blocking or throttling or providing fast lanes to particular sites and services. Without those rules, the FCC would have no power to protect competition in internet video services. So enjoy the new pay TV competition. Shop around, find a service you like. Just be aware, this era of choice may not last.

Just recently in December, it was reported that a malware called 'Gooligan' breached accounts of more than a million users. Now, a bizarre new type of malware has been detected in around 132 apps in Google Play that had the ability to affect Windows users, according to a security firm. Palo Alto Networks discovered the malware-ridden apps and reported them to Google to have them removed from Google Play. The Internet security team in a blog post said that the apps, which were developed by several different people, managed to hide HTML-based iframe tags. The iframe tags, which are generally used to embed external elements in a webpage, like a YouTube video, was also loading elements from malicious domains. In one case, an app didn't use iframe but Microsoft's Visual Basic language to load malicious code into the app. In the report, Palo Alto Networks traces the infected apps to a common geographical location even though the developers are unrelated. Most of the apps are said to originate from Indonesia, since the country's name was attached to the names of the apps. "One common way HTML files have been infected with malicious iframes has been through file infecting viruses like Ramnit. After infecting a Windows host, these viruses search the hard drive for HTML files and append iframes to each document. If a developer was infected with one of these viruses, their app's HTML files could be infected," the report notes. The reports goes on to suggest that the malicious nature of the apps was not intentional and that the developers simply did not realise that their apps' HTML files were infected when uploading their apps to Google Play. Furthermore, the purpose of the malware was to load interstitial ads and the main malicious applications, elaborates Ars Technica. These Windows-specific malware were downloaded from domains that have long since been disabled. So while the apps themselves aren't a threat on Android devices, it still raises concerns on Google's app screening process, and why it failed to identify the infected apps.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Security firm identifies over 100 malware-infected… Security firm identifies over 100 malware-infected Android apps, but don't panic By Adam Ismail — March 2, 2017 10:57 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you It's important to stay mindful of mobile malware, especially as attackers migrate from legacy platforms like PC onto modern mobile operating systems. While many users are more aware of the threat of mobile malware today than in years past, and Google has made significant strides in protecting phones from those toxic apps, the risk never completely goes away. Vulnerabilities can present in the unlikeliest of ways, as this report from security firm Palo Alto Networks explains. The company cites 132 apps on the Google Play Store that feature malware — though not the kind that could actually do any harm to your smartphone. The reason being, these apps attempt to install a Windows executable file, which Android devices do not support. More: This is how Google ensures the Play Store remains free from potential malware At first glance, it appears to be a completely ineffectual attempt at attacking users, until you consider the possibility that these apps were actually infected with malicious code unbeknownst to the developer. The malware exploits the apps’ use of Android WebView to link to dangerous HTML sites, that then attempt to install a file designed for Windows onto the device. Palo Alto goes into greater detail, identifying specific lines of code that act as the culprits, but the important point to note is that none of it could actually compromise your phone in any way. On Windows, the malware would reportedly modify firewall settings, alter the network hosts file, and copy and inject itself into numerous other processes. The apps in question span seven different developers, and security analysts speculate it may have arrived on Android by way of a file-infecting virus. These viruses would in turn seek out and infect HTML files on the developers’ computers, and it’s not hard to imagine how they could then spread to software published on the Play Store. A common online development platform used to produce all of the affected apps may have been the origin. Ultimately, Google would classify this as a “non-Android threat” — terminology for applications that are unable to harm a user’s device, but are potentially damaging to other platforms. After reporting its findings to Google, Palo Alto says all the offenders were removed from the Play Store. While it’s not terribly comforting to know your device may have been a conduit for malware without ever realizing it, the work done by Google and security firms like Palo Alto does shed some light on the multitude of ways in which a virus can spread — and that will, in turn, make our devices safer.

PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY Hulk Hogan Gets a Big Payday From Gawker and We’re All Poorer For It     Francoise Shaibend: Anatomy of Sex, Money, Marriage Scam on Google Plus CELEBRITIES Google Sex Scam Queen: 'Devil in Flesh of a Fairy' Preys on Lonely Heart Men Mystery Woman at Center of Multiple Scams By Keith Girard, March 22nd, 2016 She goes by several names and is at the center of several Google Plus sex and marriage scams. But the identity of this strikingly beautiful woman remains a mystery. (Photo: Google Plus) Google sex and marriage scams all have one thing in common, a strikingly attractive woman. The are diverse, invariably young and desperately seeking true love, marriage and children. But no one has figured into more scams than an angel-faced beauty described by one victim as a “devil in the flesh of a fairy.” Her name is Carine, or Miriam, or Liliane, depending on any one of several profiles posted on Google Plus, according to an IM special investigation of the search engine’s social media site. Third in a Series The scams appear to be based out of France, or the former French colonies of Ivory Coast and Mali. The latter are hotbeds of extremist Islamic groups. Only last week Ivory Coast was rocked by a deadly terror attack. A terrorist connection could not be determined by the limited scope of IM’s investigation. But we discovered concrete evidence that organized groups are running the scams out of the terrorist hotbeds. One group also revealed a Luxembourg connection, suggesting it had roots in Europe as well. Given the lack of safeguards on Google’s social media site and the ease that fake profiles can be created, groups like al Qaeda could easily be perpetrating similar scams to raise money for terror attacks. So far, Google has not returned calls to answer questions about the abuse of its social media service. ‘Carine’ sent this enticing photo during our first conversation. Her goal was obvious. She was throwing out bait to hook her prey. It’s hard to know how effective the scams are. But they are pursued aggressively by the predators who operate them. One of the woman’s profiles had more than 800 connections, all men in their 30s to early 60s. The conversations began casually enough over Google Chat, also known as a Google Hangout. The service is noted for its privacy. In some cases Skype is also used. Soon enough, the conversation turns to love and marriage and invariably ends with a plea for money. The mystery woman first contacted us using the Google profile of a woman named Carine Surgers. It said she worked for Medical Pharmacies Group Inc., a French conglomerate. The profile said she attended St Therese’s School, girl’s Catholic school in Caen, a town in Northwest France, where she also said she lived. Although she provided a fairly detailed backstory about her life, several discrepancies quickly raised red flags. As it turned, out she’d stolen the identity used on the profile. We discovered the profile of the real Carine Surgers on a French executive networking site. Despite claiming to be a devout Catholic who attended church everyday, she knew surprisingly little about French Catholicism. Her profile said she lived in Caen, but her Skype account said she was located in Marseille in the south of France. During our conversations, Carine kept sending a steady steam of photos, each more risque than the next. During our initial conversations, she said she was traveling to the Ivory Coast to close out some of her father’s business affairs following his death. In fact, she may be based out of the African country. A trace of her computer’s IP address led to the Abidjan, the country’s major industrial city. A retired French executive who has traveled extensively in the Middle East and Africa, including the Ivory Coast, said Carine’s language skills were rudimentary. That suggested French was her second language, or that she could be an native of French equatorial Africa. The executive, who assisted with IM’s investigation in exchange for remaining anonymous, was also contacted by the mystery women and told the same story we’d heard. She was in the Ivory Coast on business while desperately searching for true love on the Internet. In fact, the woman may have been only tangentially involved in the scam, or possibly even not at all. Sessions recorded by IM during our investigation revealed that at least one man posed as her on Skype. During most conversations, we asked Carine to video verify her identity over Skype. She always complied. But we later learned the videos were pre-recorded. We simply asked her to perform easy tasks, like holding up fingers, touching her nose, or flashing a peace sign. She never did. It was also possible to tell, from changes in phrasing and syntax, that we were talking with different people at different times. All conversations were in writing in French. The woman pictured here claimed to be Miriam Delpech from Mali. The photo inset is from her Google profile. The woman is identical to ‘Carine.’ That led to our conclusion the scam was an organized effort likely involving several people. Lonely heart scams are as old as the Internet and sprang up with the proliferation of online-dating sites. Most major sites have since cracked down on fake profiles making it harder for scammers to operate. But Google’s social media site appears to be a wide open and a haven for scammers. Russian and Eastern European organized crime groups were behind early scams. There’s no reason to believe terror groups haven’t adopted their tactics to scam money from unwitting victims. The mystery surrounding “Carine” deepened when we discovered another Google profile featuring her. This time, the name on her profile was Miriam Delpech. She declined to video verify, claiming she did not know how to use Skype and would only talk on Google chat. Miriam’s story is similar to Carine’s with a few changes in detail. She said she lived in Mali, a former French colony that borders the Ivory Coast. She added that she lived with her mother and sister and worked as a waitress in a restaurant.

We asked her to verify her identity with a photo. The woman in the photo was identical to Carine. There is no indication the two scams are related, even though their background stories were similar as was their quest to find love on the Internet. But both the Mali and Ivory Coast groups had numerous photos of the same women the each claimed to be.

Loran Glasco Jr Hello all lets see i know of two other names and pictures they use one is of Raven Riley. then their is the one of Brett Rossi and a few others i can think of Annyonmus I was also scammed by the same person and she called her self Bruce Antwi and used about 5 skype id’s i.e. Sweet baby, Bruce, and e mail as loveannangel. I did fall into her scam and sent her money to get a better internet (fast) and strong. But she would never talk on the microphone that made me suspicious and once I went on the Internet to see other scammers, her pictures and videos were all over and they marched the pictures she had sent me… She seems smart when she starts but becomes dumb when she starts asking money so quick and by doing so exposes herself as scammer. Now that I have done a wast research on her, all she does is places bait to other lonely people in the world. I told her why do you beg for money and not work like normal people do and she made an excuse of not finding work. My conclusion at this time is that the person we are talking to may not be even a women it may very well be a man on the other side posing as a women searching for love, and marriage. She has given me her address and the only way someone could shed some light on this mystery is to go to Ghana, in the city of Kumasi and investigate who this person is???? Steve brooks Try the name jennifer obiri. From ghana and all her buddies Ilie Enache please check out on skype her name:natalie.luis1 now he used name of Maryline Tanner form Niles state Michigan…. RomanceScamsNow.com You do realize those photos are stolen by the scammer from a real person, right? kredacter Yes, you are right, in many cases the photos are stolen. But in this case, we video verified her identity on Skype. Plus, she has sent us more than a dozen photos in all manner of poses. Typically, when photos are stolen, a scammer may only have a few. That’s why it’s always important to ask for multiple photos if engaging someone you don’t know on social media. As it turns out, the video was faked as well. RomanceScamsNow.com Not sure how you “verified” her identity on Skype, but scammers easily fake skype video calls. This is very big business, and while some scammers are dumb, overall they have better tools than most victims. In short, you should be very cautious about the allegation, because we only know of a single webcam/porn star that has connections to the scammers, and even then, she is not conducting the scams, We have 25 years tracking scammers, and would love to share more with you. http://romancescamsnow.com/dating-scams/fake-webcam-footage-fools-online-daters-into-falling-for-scam-artists/   Article Reprints   Subscribe To TheImproper's Email Newsletters, Free!

Real Estate Why It's So Hard To Build The Next Silicon Valley BLOOMBERG NEWS 3/03/2017 Reprints When Brandon Schatz learned in December 2012 that Kansas City, Kan., had become the first city in the nation to get Google Fiber, a superfast internet service, he started making plans to move his nascent sports photography business there. The day after Christmas, he drove the 165 miles from his home in Springfield, Mo., to check it out. By Feb. 1, he had settled into his new house. By Feb. 4, he was connected to the network.  That was exactly what officials had wanted. When the area (first Kansas City, Kan., with Kansas City, Mo., added weeks later) won a challenge to be the first to get Google Fiber, local boosters celebrated, hoping to kick-start an economic renaissance: attracting entrepreneurs, cultivating emerging business districts, and becoming known as a major startup hub. Four years later, Schatz's company Sportsphotos.com, which takes photos of amateur sporting events around the country, is growing slowly. He's taking full advantage of the speedy internet, uploading hundreds of high-resolution photos in minutes from races and other matches. But the business isn't yet where he wants it to be, and for now Schatz's main source of income is web development work and renting out rooms in his home on Airbnb. On a recent Sunday, Schatz sat in his home, where he also operates his company, pecking away at a desktop, surrounded by pizza boxes. "I thought we would be huge already," he said. Misplaced Expectations Schatz's disappointment is a tale of misplaced expectations, by both entrepreneurs and city leaders. In 2011 the cities' two mayors called Fiber's then-future deployment "a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," and a way to "spark economic development." And for Google, which since significantly has pared down support for the project, it was a case of placing too much faith in the ability of its own technology to change lives. A Google Fiber team member in 2012 answers a Kansas City-area resident's question about when a local school will have access to high-speed internet service. (Jill Toyoshiba/MCT/Newscom) It's also been hard for the Kansas City area to become the boom town that leaders dreamed of. Some entrepreneurs, like Schatz, were drawn to the city because of the fiber, and some launched businesses. A "startup village" sprang up. But few of the companies really took off, and some frustrated founders ended up decamping to San Francisco, where there was a larger talent pool and greater access to capital. Even the best of intentions and superspeedy internet isn't enough to create a new Silicon Valley. Every year after the first fiber connections lit up for Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google in late 2012, greater Kansas City's GDP growth has fallen well short of the national average. In 2015, it was just 1.5%, compared to 2.6% for the nation as a whole. Metro regional numbers aren't yet available for all of 2016, although based on state numbers through the third quarter, both Kansas and Missouri seem to be beating the national average. "We're scratching our heads a little bit," said Jeff Pinkerton of the Mid America Regional Council, a nonprofit that conducts economic research for greater Kansas City. "Why is Kansas City really not taking off, especially with this asset like Google Fiber?" Google came to town in 2011. At Wyandotte High School auditorium, on the Kansas side, blue, red, yellow and green spotlights shone on a parade of dignitaries who addressed the audience. Google founder Sergey Brin spoke on a prerecorded video. After the announcement about fiber going into Kansas City, a Google vice president invited the crowd to a barbecue-laden celebration. Kansas City beat out more than 1,000 other cities for the debut Google fiber project, which aimed to compete against the telecommunications and cable giants that have dominated the market for internet access. Some analysts believed the ultimate goal was to encourage those competitors to improve their own services and thus the internet experience overall, which would bolster the environment for Alphabet's most lucrative business: online search. Mayors of both cities announced a team of civic leaders to figure out how best to leverage fiber, in entrepreneurship as well as other areas such as education. The group released a plan in 2012 that made recommendations ranging from nurturing technology districts to supporting tax credits for small technology businesses to creating mentor networks. An Incubator For Startups Despite budget challenges, the state of Kansas has stuck by a pre-existing income tax credit of up to $50,000 for angel backers who invest in a young company. Working with a group called Techstars, Kansas City-based Sprint (S) created an incubator for startups. The Kauffman Foundation, a think tank based in Kansas City, Mo., started a weekly gathering for entrepreneurs. An area straddling State Line Road, the border, became the first neighborhood that Google wired for fiber, and a community of founders sprang up. The district, which had zoning laws that made it easier to run a business from home, became known as Startup Village. That's where Schatz, the owner of Sportsphotos.com, moved into a rental house. It was an online video about the Kansas City experiment that drew him. He realized that Google Fiber could be the key to his nascent business: Batches of photos that took 40 to 50 hours to upload would be done in less than one. "It's a little nerdy, to see this video and be all kinds of inspired," says Schatz, 34, a boyish looking former U.S. Army sergeant whose tours of duty included Bosnia. "But I was inspired." Yet in practice, a dazzling internet connection didn't mean much for some businesses. Mike Farmer operated his startup, Leap, a search engine, out of a Startup Village house for a while. "What do you do with gigabit speed that makes the experience more relevant?" he recalls asking his team. They goofed around with ideas, such as having search results take the form of several high-definition Netflix movies streaming at the same time. Given that most users wouldn't have gigabit internet, Leap never did find the right scenario. Farmer wound down the business last year. "The true power of Google fiber is exposure," says Matthew Marcus, executive director of the Kansas City Startup Foundation and co-leader of the Startup Village, referring to the publicity the technology brought to the city's startup community. "The fact is, it's really difficult to consume one gigabit of speed." In Search Of Talent And Capital Some startups have contended with the lack of access to a big talent pool. Tech companies in Silicon Valley, Waterloo, Canada, and New York City, tend to hire from nearby universities with strong software-engineering programs. The schools with the strongest engineering schools in the region are more than two hours away from Kansas City, though.Funding has also been a problem in Kansas City. Entrepreneurs lamented that local investors looked for the type of traction that would merit tens of millions of dollars from Silicon Valley venture firms. But if businesses achieve that, Midwestern venture firms invest just single-digit millions. Lack of access to capital contributed to the departure of two promising Kansas City startups, bond marketplace Neighborly and green-homebuilder Acre, which both moved most operations to Silicon Valley. "There are plenty of angels that will write $50,000 checks, but there's not that much bridge," says Sandy Kemper, chief executive officer of Fairway, Kansas-based C2FO, a working-capital finance company he founded in 2008. Kemper turned to big investors outside Kansas City, including San Francisco's Mithril Capital and Singapore's Temasek Holdings, for most of his backing. In his hometown, "there is a finer filter, and maybe a little bit higher hurdle." One advantage cited by many local entrepreneurs, low costs, can actually backfire. "It might be a misplaced sense of comfort," says Ajay Royan, the general partner at Mithril Capital who invested in C2FO. He believes the best entrepreneurs work with an intensity driven by the reality of global competition — a reality too easily lost sight of in a low-pressure, low-cost environment. "If you get comfortable with the fact that things seem to be going well in Kansas City," he says, and don't think beyond it, "that's bad." C2FO is one many other entrepreneurs hope will eventually list on a public market and raise hundreds of millions of dollars, with a valuation north of a billion. It has already raised $99 million and is used by some of the world's biggest companies, including Acer, Costco (COST), Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKA) BNSF Railway, and Pfizer (PFE). That type of public offering, more than anything, would truly foster entrepreneurship in Kansas City, entrepreneurs say. It would show existing investors the upside of investing more than a few thousand dollars in startups, along with creating a class of richly rewarded early employees who would in turn likely become investors in other startups — or founders of their own. Lance LeMay, a venture capitalist at Kansas City, Mo.-based Open Air Equity Partners who invested in Kemper's and Farmer's companies, said boosting the venture-backed startup ecosystem in Kansas City won't even take that much. "More than a billion-dollar exit, you need lots of successful exits," he said. "You don't need a home run. You need lots of doubles." Fiber's Impact In the years that Kansas City has been trying to make the most out of Fiber, Google has been doing the same. In early days, company executives talked it up, with executive chairman Eric Schmidt telling conference goers in late 2012 that of all the company's current innovations, including self-driving cars, it was Google's "most compelling on many levels," something that "changes your life." Shortly afterward, it started announcing more cities for the project, beginning with Austin, Texas, and Provo, Utah. In 2013, the company recruited Craig Barratt, a wireless chip industry veteran, to lead the group that included Fiber. In 2015, when Google became Alphabet, Barratt was given the title of CEO. Over time, Google Fiber announced it would expand into 21 cities. But just as Kansas City might have overestimated the asset that Google Fiber could become, Google overestimated Fiber's impact, and its expansion plans deflated. Barratt left in October 2016, surprising many employees. The same day, the unit announced it was stalling expansion plans in eight cities and cutting 9% of its staff. This month, Alphabet hired Barratt's replacement, broadband executive Gregory McCray, and further slimmed Fiber, shifting hundreds of its employees over to Google's core internet business. Fiber is now in only nine locations, including Atlanta and Orange County, Calif. Other Bets, the part of Alphabet that Google Fiber belongs to, reported losses of $3.58 billion last year on revenue of $809 million. It also contributed to Other Bets' $1.39 billion in capital expenditures. A number of factors lay behind Fiber's strategic shift. Former employees said a chief reason was the discrepancy between the desires of Google's co-founders to expand the service and make it faster and the demanding costs of providing it. Cable incumbents moved aggressively, introducing similar high-speed services at low prices. Unexpected political hurdles emerged. In Louisville, Ky., for instance, AT&T (T) and Charter Communications (CHTR) sued Google Fiber over a wonky utility-bill regulation. "Google invested in Fiber during a time when it was willing to make lots of big investments with uncertain or long-term returns, but over the last couple of years Google has become a different place," says Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "It doesn't necessarily make sense for Alphabet to continue to invest in it as heavily at this point." Schatz recently changed his business model. Instead of getting amateur athletes to pay for the photos, they download them for free, with sponsorship fees providing his revenue. Having observed the reluctance of local investors to back companies that lack strong income, he is working to build relationships with big sports retailers and fitness companies that could sponsor the blanket photography of the events he shoots. The race-photography business alone is worth $20 million to $50 million annually a year on sponsorships, he calculates; add in other amateur sports and expanded marketing initiatives and it could be exponentially more. But for now, he's capturing just a tiny portion; revenue last year doubled but was still under $100,000, he says. This year, he hopes to keep growing and achieve profitability. He knows developing ties to potential sponsors would be much easier in a city like New York or Los Angeles, but he believes he can pull it off from the heartland. Sometimes, he thinks back to advice a venture capitalist gave him a few years ago, to drop everything else and focus only on his business. The laid-back atmosphere in Kansas City made it easier to put that advice aside, he says. "It probably would have been good to have extra pressure," he says now. Still, he says perks such as a community of fellow entrepreneurs make him happy he stayed put. Meanwhile, some of the original startup supporters in Startup Village have sold their real estate to non-entrepreneurs. After Google Fiber came to town, Brad Feld, a venture capitalist at Boulder, Colo.-based Foundry Group bought a bungalow in Startup Village for use, gratis, by a promising young company. For a time, Leap's Farmer housed interns there. Today, a startup engineer lives in the house. On a recent visit, a layer of dark fuzz and grime obscured floors. A vacuum cleaner stood at the far end of the main room, plugged in but apparently unused. A side room lacked furniture, but did sport a large pile of clothing flung in its center. A skittish cat bolted across the kitchen. Three doors down the street, Schatz has decided to launch an intense search for financial backers. An early port of call: Silicon Valley.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Outlook 2016 for Mac supports Google Calendar and… Outlook 2016 for Mac supports Google Calendar and Contacts for Office Insiders By Mark Coppock — March 1, 2017 1:57 PM Subscribe Share Microsoft Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Microsoft gives you another reason to become an Office Insider, with enhanced Google account support for Outlook 2016 for Mac. Office 2016 for Mac has gone a long way to bringing Mac users the same experience as those running on Microsoft’s own Windows platform. Gone are the days of Office for Mac having its own user interface and feature set, and now Mac owners can even take part in the same Office Insider preview program as Windows users. Outlook 2016 has seen as much of an overhaul as any Office application for MacOS and now Microsoft is bringing enhanced support for Google Calendar and Contacts to the Mac. If you’re a part of the Office Insider Fast Ring community, then the most recent update lets you use more of what Google has to offer in the way of managing your time and relationships. More: Microsoft’s Office Insider now has its very own Insider Fast Ring Up until now, Outlook 2016 for Mac only supported connecting to and managing Gmail accounts. That meant Mac users could get access to their Google email, but nothing else. Now, Microsoft is adding the ability to sync Google Calendar and Contact accounts as well, with the same add, delete, and time and location editing functionality as was previously available only with Outlook. In addition, Outlook 2016 for Mac also now supports some Gmail-specific Outlook.com, Office 365, and Exchange email features as well. First is the new Focused Inbox functionality that breaks email messages into “Focused” and “Other” tabs based on what Microsoft’s machine intelligence decides is important and urgent email. Outlook 2016 for Mac also now supports the same rich experiences for travel reservations and package deliveries that have been arriving for other Microsoft email clients. As is often the case, you will need to be an Office Insider in the Fast Ring to gain the earliest access to these new features. You can sign up to be an Office Insider by opening Outlook 2016 for Mac, going to Help > Check for Updates, and following these instructions. Not everyone will gain immediate access to the complete Google account support right away, however, as Microsoft will be monitoring the experience and inviting specific users. You will be prompted to add the support when you are added to the list.
Digital Trends Home > Computing > Google is improving its Safe Browsing features to… Google is improving its Safe Browsing features to protect MacOS users By Jonathan Keane — March 1, 2017 2:28 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Google is taking steps to ensure users are protected from the latest attacks targeting Mac computers. Safe Browsing, Google’s in-browser warning system, has announced a number of new updates to help protect against malware in MacOS. MacOS users should expect to see more warnings in the future, advising them on malicious activity on the sites they are visiting. Safe Browsing is used in Firefox and Safari, not just Chrome. According to a blog post on Wednesday, Safe Browsing is turning its attention to two common browser abuses — ad injection and manipulation of Chrome settings. Some of the most common Chrome setting changes relate to the changing of the start page, homepage, and default search engine, which Google is trying to stem. Google also recently released the Chrome Settings API for Mac to help develops set safer settings for users. Starting March 31, Chrome will alert users when changes are being made to their settings that didn’t go through this API. “Also, developers should know that only extensions hosted in the Chrome Web Store are allowed to make changes to Chrome settings,” it added in the blog post. More: This new Mac malware freezes your computer with email drafts The updates from Google come at a pertinent time for MacOS users. Mac malware has become much more common with new strains regularly being discovered. While it’s still nowhere near the levels of malware affecting Windows devices, it should still be a cause for concern for any Mac user. Security researchers discovered a fresh attack recently that abuses Microsoft Word doc macros to deliver malware. It’s long been a trick used to infect Windows computers. Wrongdoers are getting inventive too. Just earlier this year, a Mac-specific technique carried out denial of service attacks on victims by launching hundreds of email drafts at once, causing the device to crash. Also at the recent RSA security conference, there was much talk about the proliferation of Mac malware and we should expect to see more emerging this year.
News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google App Beta Testing Brings ‘Visual Search’ While Gboard Gets Translator Icon By Zara Ali Mar 3, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Google started rolling out a beta update for its Google app, last night. The new beta update brings minor changes to the app and brings the app to version 6.14. However, these small changes suggest that the tech giant is working on enhanced image search tool and adding photo-centric features. The company has not made these changes live yet, but they will soon be available from the navigation menu. There will be a new “visual search” option in the app that is integrated with a camera to perform the search functions. Users will able to select a part of the image and then choose from a series of search results in a card-like format that are relative to the picture. On tapping on one result, the entire search result opens in detail. This is not the first time when Google has come up with an in-app image search feature. Earlier, there was Screen search (formerly known as Now on Tap). It is a right move for Google to integrate a dedicated visual search feature in the app. Even though Google Assistant will soon be a part of many Android devices, but it also lacks image search function. Besides, Google has also added other features such as “saves” in the navigation slider for Google Images. The Saves feature organises all the saved items and tags. Both “visual search” and “Saves” features are not live on regular Google app yet, but the company will soon roll them out officially for non-beta users as well. You can sign up here for Google beta test program. Advertisement In another news, Google Gboard keyboard beta version has also got various new features with a new update. The app now houses Google Translate option, which will translate texts in a jiffy with single tap. It will save a lot of time as users would no longer require to open a separate app or browser to translate text. Not just translation function, the app has also got a new theme selector, which will let users personalise Gboard’s outlook. The theme selector is boradly divided into categories like Landscapes section, Solid Colors, and more. Furthermore, the Gboard can also predict emojis now and supports a new language – Bashkir. If you cannot wait for an official rollout, then you can participate in the beta testing program for Gboard. Click on this link to sign up.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft should bring its Photos app to the iPhone and Android 1 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Mar 3, 2017 at 22:30 GMT3 days ago Photography is one of the most used services on mobile devices with manufacturers of modern flagship devices like Samsung’s S7, the Google Pixel and the Huawei P10 taking pains to let prospective buyers know just how much better their cameras are than those of rivals. While Microsoft (by way of its partnership with the then influential phone manufacturer Nokia) had been on the forefront of the mobile camera revolution – providing the software and hardware that helped power the amazing cameras found in champions like the Lumia 1020, 830, 930 and 950 a few years ago, the firm’s role in mobile photography is more limited now. For iPhone and Android users, most will only think of Microsoft and photo storage when installing the OneDrive app which serves as a bridge between ecosystems for Microsoft users allowing them to store and retrieve files between various devices. For Mobile users, there is a clear emphasis on photography. Microsoft’s OneDrive app on both iOS and Android stores photos automatically tags them, organizes them and for all intents and purposes can act as a full-fledged photos app if need be. However, unlike Google which provides both a Google Drive app and a Google Photos app, Microsoft does not provide a Photos app for non-Windows devices. For PCs and phones with Windows 10, Microsoft’s Photos app is the default photo gallery app which integrates with OneDrive’s backend to provide a modern photo experience which is comparable and in some ways superior to competitors like Apple Photos and Google Photos. A Microsoft Photos app on iOS and Android could take the position of Google Photos for many users who are otherwise embedded in the Microsoft ecosystem. Personally, in my case, I rarely use the Google Photos app on iPhone. I view my Photos on two places, my phone and my Surface (with my Android phone relegated as a media player/Netflix in bed machine). Currently, OneDrive is the bridge between these two devices, with photos captured by the iPhone’s slick camera automatically uploaded to OneDrive and appearing on my PC within minutes Microsoft already has a camera app for the iPhone – two in fact. A gallery app which collates all your photos and makes photo management better on the iPhone would go a long way in unifying a PC and mobile experience. Now, I know I’ve been using iOS as an example here but there’s no reason the same couldn’t be accomplished on Android devices. and even better with many Android devices being able to change and set default apps. Many of Microsoft’s core apps are already on mobile platforms, what’s one more app from a company best known for its software?

Microsoft and Google Defeat Apple in Schools As iPads and MacBooks Hit New Low GO Research shows use of Apple devices collapses in the US Mar 3, 2017 22:37 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft and Google both experienced substantial increases in the education sector, while Cupertino-based rival Apple hit a new low last year, according to a new report. Futuresource Consulting says in a research that Google is the leading choice in the classroom in the United States, while Microsoft’s Windows has become the runner-up. At the same time, Apple’s devices have turned from leaders to one of the last choices, losing ground lately due to the lack of innovations. Specifically, the research shows that, in the United States, Chromebooks are the number one choice with no less than 58 percent share, while Windows comes second with 22 percent. iOS fell to third place with 14 percent, down from 19 percent, while Linux is the last one with 5 percent. Chromebooks experienced the biggest change versus 2015, as it managed to improve shipments by 8 percent. A total of 12.6 million devices were sold to schools in 2016, and more than half of them were Chromebooks, the research indicates. As far as the rest of the world is concerned, Windows is the dominating choice here with 65 percent, while Android is second with 17 percent. iOS is third with 9 percent, followed by Chrome OS with 6 percent. Microsoft and Google likely to continue growth Both Microsoft and Google are expected to grow in education, mostly as a result of investments in 2-in-1s and the growing number of OEMs building devices that come with detachable keyboards. 2-in-1 devices have become Microsoft’s own obsession, as the Redmond-based software giant itself pioneered this product category with its own Surface lineup. These devices bring a series of advantages for customers in the education sectors, as they can be used as both tablets and laptops, having a detachable keyboard and touchscreen. “Both Microsoft and Google (and their respective partners) have announced a wide range of 2-in-1 products designed specifically for education and are expected to sell for under $300. The 2-in-1 form factor is ideal for education, providing schools with flexibility in usage,” the research reads. Apple is also investing in 2-in-1s, but the bigger price point seems to significantly affect adoption in schools, so it’ll be interesting to see how Cupertino tackles the growth of Google and Microsoft in this industry. #Microsoft#Google#Apple#Surface#Windows subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Loses First Place to Apple in NZ 2-in-1 Battle Better Late than Never: Microsoft Surface Now Supports Wake on LAN New Windows Phone Spotted at MWC 2017 MediaTek Says No to Windows 10 on ARM Because It’s a Risky Idea Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Android Pay Now Available in Belgium After Samsung Pay Expanded to India Italy Blocks RARBG, Flashx, Other Torrent Sites Microsoft Brings Outlook on Apple’s MacBook Touch Bar Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge    Apple losing ground in US schools New Apps JD-GUI: A useful application that was designed to provide a fast Java decompiler and reduce the time and energy you spend on your projects Box Sync: Official client from Box Sync, the alternative to Dropbox services with so much for space, enabling you to access the cloud files on your devices IP Watch: Keep track of dozens of IP address from the devices you are monitoring in the network and get alerts whenever the status changes with this tool TCP Optimizer: A network connection tweaking tool that enables experts to tamper with their broadband connection and optimize the connection speed Save to Pocket: Save your favorite content while browsing online by adding it to a virtual pocket with this reliable extension that lets you configure some of its parameters Gideros: Create new applications in an easy-to-understand programming environment using HTML and javascript with this comprehensive application jGnash: Manage your finances, add multiple reminders, create budgets based on your history and generate reports with this handy Java-built application Reader comments Linux Pioneer Munich Makes Huge Step Towards Returning to Windows more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Google Allo gets improved GIF and emoji support, easier access to Google Assistant Posted Mar 2, 2017 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Amazon begins large-scale rooftop solar installation across its warehouses Allo, the messaging app Google launched into a crowded market last September, is getting an update today. The update focuses on improved support for emoji and GIFs (because that is, after all, what the world needs), and easier access to the Google Assistant. As far as we can tell, Allo has been anything but a hit for Google. With Hangouts, the company had a perfectly solid and competitive cross-platform messaging app in the market. Instead of trying to build on that, though, it launched Allo for messaging and Duo for one-on-one video chats. Hangouts was supposed to become the more business-centric chat app and Allo and Duo were supposed to become its consumer counterparts. All Google achieved with this strategy so far is confusion and very little traction in the marketplace for either Allo or Duo. And to muddy the waters even more, Google also quietly launched Meet by Google Hangouts — an extra-enterprise friendly version of Hangout — earlier this week and then quickly pulled the app from the Google Play store after we wrote about it. Today’s update isn’t likely to make a difference in Allo’s popularity. If you do use it, though, it’ll now be easier to add GIFs to your conversations. You only have to tap the smiley icon in the chat bar and then swipe left to bring up the GIF search. Easy enough. Allo is also getting new animated emoji. Simply select one, touch and hold the send button, and then drag up or down to make them larger or smaller. Probably the most useful new feature is faster access to the Google Assistant in Allo. The compose box now features a button that lets you add the Assistant to any conversation with just a tap. Google says one out of twelve messages in group chats in Allo are to the Google Assistant already. All of these new features are starting to roll out on Android today and will also come to iOS “soon” (though it’s unclear how soon “soon” is). 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Jay Z Has Arrived | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes messaging messaging apps Google Allo Google Apps Popular Posts Featured Stories Jay Z Has Arrived | Crunch Report VIDEO | 3:21 | Crunch Report Amazon’s AWS buys Thinkbox Software, maker of tools for creative professionals 11 hours ago | Ingrid Lunden Should Snap buy Twitter? 12 hours ago | Alex Wilhelm, Jonathan Shieber Justin Kan launches his own startup incubator program called Zero-F 12 hours ago | Jon Russell Snap tumbles 12% on day three, erases gains 13 hours ago | Katie Roof Latest From Mobile Old-school social networks Tagged and Hi5 bought by MeetMe for $60M 10 hours ago | Josh Constine Will the Galaxy S8 let Samsung put the Note 7 behind it for good? 14 hours ago | Brian Heater Lightroom Mobile gains RAW HDR capture on iOS and Android 16 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Trying out Prisma’s new photo filter store yesterday | Anthony Ha Comment moderation powered by Up Next Amazon begins large-scale rooftop solar installation across its warehouses Posted Mar 2, 2017 CrunchBoard Job Listings Mobile User Experience Designer (UX) - TrainingPeaks at Peaksware (Boulder, CO, United States) Director of Community & Business Development (YC-backed) at Paragon One (New York, NY, United States) Lead Web Developer @ Numerai at Numerai (San Francisco, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer- Fullstack/Backend @ Sift Science at Sift Science (San Francisco, CA, United States) SysAdmin DevOps at Peaksware (Boulder, CO, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this Apple is losing ground in its traditional market: Education Analysts peer into Microsoft's rumored Windows 10 Cloud Microsoft’s OS supremacy over Apple to end in 2017 Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Apple last year again lost ground in the U.S. K-12 market, as Google with its Chrome OS continued to make gains, a research firm said Thursday. In 2016, 58% of the 12.6 million mobile computers shipped to educational customers -- or approximately 7.3 million -- were powered by Chrome OS, up from 50% of 2015's 10.7 million (or 5.35 million), U.K.-based Futuresource Consulting said in a report yesterday. Meanwhile, Apple's OS X/macOS and iOS operating systems -- which power Macs and iPads, respectively -- fell from a combined 25% share in 2015 (or 2.7 million devices) to 19% in 2016 (or 2.4 million). Futuresource counted laptops, tablets, Chromebooks and the aged category dubbed "netbooks," but omitted desktop computers in its tallies. The downturn in Apple's K-12 fate last year was the second consecutive decline, according to Futuresource: In 2014, OS X + iOS accounted for 34% of educational mobile computer shipments in the U.S. That year, Chrome OS's share was 38%. While Apple's share was falling and Google's was climbing, Microsoft's remained stable, said Futuresource: Windows powered 25% of the shipped computers in 2014, dipped to 22% the next year and held steady at the same share in 2016. Apple's educational reputation harks back nearly 40 years, with roots in the Apple IIe that became the de facto educational computer in the K-12 world. But the higher prices of the Mac successor, and continued premium cost of the company's iPad from 2010 on, allowed first the Windows PC and then later, Chromebooks, to curry favor because of their lower acquisition costs. Futuresource cited Chromebooks' affordability and manageability as selling points, but not surprisingly in an environment where school district dollars are ever more precious, stressed the former above all else. "The rise of Chromebooks has also set new industry benchmarks with regards to average device pricing, with prices reaching as low as $120 on certain projects," the research firm said. Microsoft has announced initiatives to better compete with Chrome OS -- an attempt to move Windows' share from its mid-20s mark -- such as January's trumpeting of Windows 10 devices as low as $189, and Intune for Education, cloud-based device management priced at $30 per machine, the same Google charges for its Chrome OS management suite. The Redmond, Wash. company is also reportedly working on a new edition of Windows 10, tagged as "Windows 10 Cloud," to power Chromebook competitors. Even so, Microsoft "continues to face challenges to win back end-user mindshare" in the educational space, said Mike Fisher, an analyst at Futuresource, in a Thursday statement. Futuresource Consulting Apple's share of the U.S. K-12 educational market has slipped two years running, while Chrome OS's has climbed to claim the largest chunk by far.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Maps adds Skull Island to help promote new King Kong movie Newsby John Callaham3 days ago 13 683 15 Skull Island might be a fictional location, but for a little while at least you can check it out on Google Maps. The company is partnering with Legendary and Universal Pictures to show where the dangerous tropical location exists as part of a promotion for the upcoming giant monster movie Kong: Skull Island. See also: Google Maps adds Uber integration and a new UI for ride options January 12, 2017 The Google Maps listing shows Skull Island as an “archaeological site” near the equator and several thousand miles west of the coast of Peru. In a statement, Google said that people can post their own photos and “fantasy reviews” of Skull Island, and so far over 6,000 people have done just that, which is pretty impressive for a fictional piece of land. If Skull Island were a real place, it would likely be deadly to most humans. The movie shows an expedition heading to check out the island sometime in the early 1970s but are quickly attacked by the massive King Kong, along with lots of other giant monsters. The movie Kong: Skull Island will hit theaters on March 10. It’s also the second in a projected series of “Monsterverse” movies that began in 2014 with the release of the latest US version of Godzilla. The third movie in the series, Godzilla: King of Monsters, will be released in March 2019, and the final film in the series, Godzilla vs. Kong, is set to hit theaters in 2020.

By JenniferBooton Reporter It isn’t his three-month-old child that keeps Sir Martin Sorrell up all night. For the chief executive officer of the world’s largest ad agency, Amazon.com Inc. is a nightmare. “In answer to the question, my favorite question, ‘What worries you when you go to bed at night and wake up in the morning?’ it isn’t a 3-month-old child,” Sorrell, a 74-year-old new father and WPP, +1.16%  EO, said Friday. “It’s Amazon, which is a child still, but not three months.” Amazon AMZN, -0.38%   is pressuring Google’s GOOGL, -0.21% GOOG, -0.16%   search business, and its penetration in advertising is “frightening if not terrifying to some,” Sorrell said. He thinks there’s “a battle brewing” between Google and Amazon. The comments were given on a conference call Friday morning after the U.K.-based ad agency reported an 18% increase in revenue for the quarter, but projected a slowdown in 2017. In London trading, shares of WPP closed down nearly 8% Friday. The digital advertising market is currently dominated by Facebook Inc. FB, +0.18%  and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, two companies that shared a whopping 58% of the $72 billion U.S. digital ads market in 2016, according to eMarketer. Amazon controlled just 1.3% of the market, but has a unique position as an e-commerce giant in which it plays liaison between brand and end user. Ad agencies have long served as the middleman between the two. While there other major players in the digital advertising space that are bigger than Amazon, including Verizon Communications VZ, -0.12% which owns AOL and is soon expected to close on a deal to buy Yahoo Inc. YHOO, -0.59%  , Amazon is particularly alarming because of the troves of data on consumer shopping behavior it has amassed over the years. In addition to its shopping portal, Amazon has unique features, such as its Alexa-powered smart home hub and Dash buy buttons people can stick around their homes, that can give brands direct insight into the way people shop. Amazon’s AI engine and the associated hardware might also provide a direct advertising portal for brands to reach potential consumers directly. What can artificial intelligence do for retail?(2:34) Customers return about 23% of their purchases both in-store and online, costing retailers $643 billion per year. Can artificial intelligence eliminate returns through virtual 3D try-on? Earlier this week on CNBC, Sorrell said Amazon and Snapchat parent Snap Inc. SNAP, -12.26%  were emerging threats to Facebook and Google in the digital advertising space. But he said Amazon, specifically, threatened Google with its search bar that consumers have been increasingly using over Google to search for products. Also Read: Nobody thinks Snap stock is worth the price Adam Smith, who serves as futures director of GroupM, the parent company of WPP, said the company has recently opened an ad agency in Seattle, where Amazon is based, to “deal with Amazon and cater to Amazon” as the company’s gains for advertising steam. WPP views digital media companies such as Google and Facebook as “frenemies.” It must work with them to meet its clients’ digital ad needs, but also continues to lose traditional advertising share to lower-margin digital advertising, which is weighing on its business. Shares of Amazon closed flat around $849.40 on Friday. They’ve gained nearly 15% in the past three months and 47% in the past year, vastly outperforming the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.33%  , which is up 9% and 19.5% in those time periods. Google’s shares have performed more in line with the larger market, increasing 11% in the past three months and 16% in the past year.

Find out how to get, activate and start using the new digital assistant, here.   Almost a year after it was first unveiled, Google has finally begun a widespread rollout of its own AI-powered virtual assistant. Following it the footsteps of popular virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa and Cortana, Google Assistant brings a digital helper of its own to Android users across the globe.   The feature, which was first showcased at Google I/O last spring, was initially made available only to Google Pixel phone users, but as of this week, Google announced that many more Android users will be enjoying Google Assistant. The feature began rolling out to Nougat and Marshmallow devices the week of February 26 and continues to become available to more users every day. If you have an Android device and want to get Google Assistant working on it but aren’t sure how, we’ve put together a comprehensive guide of everything you need to know to activate and begin using Google Assistant on your device. Google Assistant Update Release: How To Get, Activate And Start Using Google’s New Virtual Assistant Google's virtual assistant has begun rolling out to more users this week. Find out if your device is compatible. Photo: Google Which Devices Are Compatible With Google Assistant? So before you try to grab Google Assistant, the first thing you need to check is if your device is compatible. Google Assistant has been available on Google Pixel Phone since its release, but this week, Google has begun rolling out the AI helper to Android phones running Android 7.0 Nougat and 6.0 Marshmallow. While there is no official listing of phones that will be compatible with the update, here are a few popular devices that should receive it: HTC 10 HTC U Ultra Huawei P9 LG G5 LG V20 Samsung Galaxy S7 Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Sony Xperia XZ Which Countries Will Receive The Google Assistant Update? Unfortunately, Google Assistant won’t be available to users in every country. The update will release to users in the U.S. first and then will roll out to users in the UK, Australia, Canada and Germany. Android users outside of these countries will not have access to the update.  How Do I Get And Activate Google Assistant? If you know your device is compatible then getting the Google Assistant is pretty simple. All that is required is to update your device’s Google Play Services. Keep in mind, though, Google Assistant is rolling out slowly, so not everyone with a compaatible device in a country where the rollout is taking place will have access to it right away. If your Google Play Service is updated but Google Assistant still isn't available to you, it likely hasn't rolled out in your area yet. Just keep checking on it each day. How Do I Update Google Play Services? Updating Google Play Services is fairly simple but not exactly intuitive. Here are steps to follow for getting and updating Google Play Services on your Android phone. Get the latest Google Play Services APK and download it on your device. You can find a full listing of these, here. Find the APK your downloaded, and copy it to your device’s internal/external storage. Go to Settings > Security > Unknown Sources and check the box that allows 3rd-party application installation. Now find where you saved the APK on your device and open up the installation screen. Tap on the install button and the update will begin. Once the app is finished updating, Google Assistant should be ready to go! How To Check If Google Assistant Is Installed Activating Google Assistant simply requires long pressing the home button or saying "Ok, Google." Photo: Google If Google Assistant has rolled out in our area, and Google Play Services have updated properly, Google Assistant should be ready to go. To activate Google assistant and start using it, simply long press on the home button. You’ll be introduced to Google Assistant and asked to allow some permissions so that it can work. Once you’ve finished, Google Assistant is ready to use.  Tips And Tricks For Starting And Using Google Assistant You can ask Google Assistant to help with lots of things. The new virtual AI is designed to understand natural language. Photo: Google Once you know Google Assistant is installed, you are now ready to start using it. To activate Google Assistant either long press on the home button or say the magic words, “Ok, Google.” Google Assistant will pop up on the screen with a “Hi, how can I help you” message. If you are new to using a virtual assistant, you might feel a little silly talking to it. Don’t worry, though: New AI helpers like Google Assistant have been designed to recognize natural language, so just ask questions the way you would to a friend. On the Google Assistant’s support page, the company actually offers a few suggestions for things you can ask your new smartphone helper. Here’s a small sample: What's the weather today? What's will the weather be this weekend? What restaurants are nearby? I feel like having pizza tonight. Where's the closest gas station? Which pharmacy is open? How long will it take to get to the airport? Show me my schedule for tomorrow. Set an alarm for 6 a.m. Show me my photos of the beach. What's "How are you?" in German Show me the trailer for the latest Pixar movie. Are you using Google Assistant? What do you think of the new AI helper? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

Rick Osterloh, head of the hardware department at Google, spoke to AndroidPit about the future of Pixel devices. He noted that there are currently too few Pixel devices to meet consumer demand. Osterloh also confirmed that the Pixel will remain a premium device and a cheaper version won't be released. "Pixel stays premium," he said. Google is planning to follow the typical yearly smartphone release schedule similar to other manufacturers. Osterloh said, "There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it." He then followed up by saying, "You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now." With both Apple and Samsung planning some impressive updates this year, it will be interesting to see what Google has in store for its next generation Pixel.

(Photo by Fox Photos/Getty Images) Amazon, Connectivity, Facebook, Google, Microsoft Here are the Submarine Cables Funded by Cloud Giants by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on March 3, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet As their global bandwidth needs grow, operators of hyper-scale cloud platforms — Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon — have started to play a much bigger role in consortia that build intercontinental submarine cables. In some cases, these cloud companies have been signing on as major customers of future cables, thereby enabling cable builders to finance the projects. In other cases — and we’re seeing more and more of this lately — these companies get involved directly, as the projects’ investors and owners. Recent examples of the latter include Facebook and Google’s investment in construction of the Pacific Light Cable Network, which will link Los Angeles to Hong Kong, and Facebook and Microsoft’s investment in the MAREA cable, which will connect a landing station on the coast of Virginia to a landing station in Bilbao, Spain. These investments by hyper-scale companies and by other cable builders looking to serve their bandwidth needs have spurred a submarine cable construction boom. One of the potential outcomes of the boom is more demand for data center space in facilities operated by the likes of Equinix or Digital Realty Trust, among others, which can provide network access to these new connectivity routes. More on that here: Will the Submarine Cable Boom Drive More Revenue to Colos? And here’s the list of submarine cable construction projects hyper-scale cloud companies have helped fund in recent years.

FAQ: How to get Google Assistant on your Android phone Google Assistant is officially available for many Android phones now, but the rollout will take time. Danny Sullivan on March 6, 2017 at 2:07 pm More Excited to get Google Assistant on your Android phone? Until last week, it was only available for Google Pixel phones. Now, it’s rolling out slowly to Android phones beyond that. Here’s how it may come to your phone or why it might not be on it already. Google Assistant is Google’s new digital assistant to take on the likes of Siri. It allows you to easily speak what you want and get back answers. It’ll even have a conversation with you and complete some actions like movie ticket bookings, when all goes well. When it doesn’t go well, you might prefer to do a regular Google search. Until last week, the only smartphones with Google Assistant were Google’s own Pixels. However, the company announced that smartphones running Android 6 or Android 7 would get Google Assistant, with the release of Google Assistant beginning last Thursday. Here’s the rundown on how Google Assistant will come to your Android phone, if eligible. You can’t download it as an app Google Assistant isn’t an app that you can download. It’s part of the Android operating system, much as Siri is part of iOS. If Google decides your phone can handle Google Assistant, you’ll get that as part of an Android OS update. If not, you can always try Google Assistant by using Google’s Allo app. You need to meet these requirements Phones also have to have 1.5GB of memory or higher and 720p or higher screen resolution. It’s only offered to those with phones set to use English in the US, Australia, Canada and the UK. German speakers in Germany will also get it. More countries and language support are promised later this year. Phones also have to support Google Play Services. Basically, if you get your apps on your phone using the Google Play app store, you’ve got Google Play Services. You need Android 6.1.3 – maybe Last week, Google specifically told Search Engine Land that phones need to be updated to Android 6.1.3 to get Google Assistant. If you’re on Android 6 below that release, you won’t get it. Today, Google clarified that to mean that you need to have the 6.13 version of the Google app, not the 6.1.3. version of Android, to get the Google Assistant. Unfortunately, I can see one Android 6 phone that has the 6.14 version of the Google search app still doesn’t have Google Assistant. So, it’s pretty confusing. Android 7.0 may not be enough If you have Android 7.0, that alone isn’t enough for you to have Google Assistant. For example, my Galaxy S7 Edge was upgraded to Android 7.0 today. Google Assistant did not come with it. My Google Pixel phone is on Android 7.1.1, but I know someone with a Nexus 5X on that same version of Android 7.1.1 without Google Assistant. So unlike with Android 6, Google Assistant with Android 7 doesn’t seem tied to a particular version. Google told Search Engine Land today that there’s no particular version of Android 7 needed. It just might take weeks until these Android 7 devices get it. Upgrading Google Play Services may not work I’ve seen advice in various places purporting that people can download the latest version of Google Play Services and “sideload” that onto their phone to get Google Assistant. However, I have multiple phones with the most current version being recommended for download that do not have Google Assistant. I suspect this isn’t actually a solution. How long will it take to get? Google told Search Engine Land that the rollout might take weeks to come to all the eligible smartphones out there. How will I know if I have it? To know if you have Google Assistant, hold down on your home button or icon. You should get this screen: It will say, “Hi, how can I help.” If you don’t get that screen, you don’t have Google Assistant.

Paid Search· Digital Advertising· Paid Search 101 March 3, 2017 Digital Advertising Paid Search Paid Search 101 Social Ads Joe CastroMarch 3, 2017 772SHARES 2.7KREADS 772SHARES 2.7KREADS Joe Castro 772SHARES 2.7KREADS ADVERTISEMENT Facebook advertising and Google AdWords can both be viable paid media options depending on your goals and the marketing budget your company has. If you want to read how both Facebook and Google AdWords (paid search) can benefit your paid media strategy by targeting the full funnel, check out my most recent blog on “How to Leverage Paid Media for the Entire Customer’s Journey.” So why is there so much discussion around Facebook Advertising and Google AdWords in the paid media space? Simply put, the continual growth year after year cannot be ignored. According to Forbes, Facebook saw a 50% increase in active advertisers from 2015-2016 and reached 3 million advertisers. In addition, Facebook accounts for 65% of total social network ad spend expected to reach $36 billion this year. Why such a significant growth? This is primarily due to the platform’s targeting capabilities, the growth of mobile, and the growth of engaged users. Not to be entirely outdone, Google saw a 17% increase in revenues year over year, comparing 2014 to 2015 according to AdAge. Growth in revenues for AdWords are primarily attributed to the growth of mobile, shopping, and other ad formats. So, when you must select one advertising channel over the other, which one should you choose? As a side note for this article, when I talk about Google AdWords I’ll be speaking primarily to their search product (so please keep this in mind). There are several factors to consider when deciding which advertising channel is best for your organization. Digital Advertising Budget & Average CPC In most cases, the cost per click (CPC) will be significantly higher for Google AdWords than Facebook ads. Per AdEspresso, the average CPC for Facebook Ads in the US was $0.28 in Q3 of 2016. Conversely, Google AdWords search average CPC was $2.32 according to WordStream. Therefore, on average, Facebook ads were approximately 88% cheaper than AdWords in 2016. So if you have a very small monthly advertising budget (say $500-$1,000), it would be advantageous to run Facebook ads as it will allow you to “get more bang for your buck.” Granted, clicks are not everything and there are rare occurrences where you can make AdWords work with smaller budgets. However, sometimes advertisers simply do not have large enough budgets to compete on AdWords and they could see much better results (both clicks and conversions) on more affordable channels, like Facebook. Your Industry & Your Competition A related point to the first is you should consider the industry of your business and your competition when trying to make the decision. There are certain industries or sub-industries that are crazy expensive from a CPC perspective. For example, if you are considering advertising any of these keywords on Google, and you do not have an insanely large budget, you might want to reconsider. I have firsthand experience working in higher education, finance, legal, and healthcare; all are extremely competitive within AdWords and therefore very difficult to be successful in. Again, I am not advocating not using AdWords, but setting the expectation that Facebook ads might be a more affordable alternative with extremely powerful targeting capabilities for many industries. Defining Your Objective Once you’ve determined what your organization can afford and you’ve considered the industry and the competition, you then should consider what you’re hoping to achieve from this marketing initiative. If your goal is increasing brand awareness or demand generation, Facebook ads would be your best bet. However, if you’re looking to generate sales or leads (i.e. demand capture), then AdWords might be a better bet. With AdWords, a user is searching for what your organization is selling. Therefore, their intent to purchase is generally much higher. But you’ll need to once again consider overall costs. In several cases, we have seen lower cost-per-conversions (i.e. cost per leads) from Facebook ads. Stage in Buyer’s Journey Understanding where the user is in the buyer’s journey will also help you decide which advertising channel to leverage. If you are looking to capture users in the moment of looking to purchase a product or service, Google AdWords would be your best bet due to the high level of intent from your audience. However, if you’re trying to bring more awareness or consideration to your offering, then Facebook ads can help you target those with a current or unknown need for your product or service. This is how both channels can complement and fuel the growth of your organization. Product/Service Maturity & Overall Search Volume This point is obvious and somewhat overlooked. If your organization has a new product or service and there is very little or no search volume, then Google AdWords (paid search) most likely will not generate a ton of traffic and therefore is unlikely to perform. Before you rule out AdWords completely in this scenario, you may consider bidding on a series of keywords which describes a problem that your product or service solves. My recommendation would be testing out bidding on what your product or service solves rather than a product or service that very few have been exposed to. For instance, Tile, which is described as a “Bluetooth tracker,” was one of the first of its kind. Keywords such as “find your wallet,” “find your keys,” and “find your phone” could have generated significantly more search than “Bluetooth tracker” or even their own brand name. In most cases, however, I would recommend starting out on Facebook ads to generate awareness of your products or services, explain what problem they solve, and develop brand recognition. Then, you’ll generate demand to set you up for more success when it comes to Google AdWords. Demographic-sensitive Product or Service Simply put, there may be certain instances when one advertising platform is a better fit than the other. If the purchase of your product or service strongly correlates based on specific life events, then Facebook is most likely your best option. Facebook has powerful targeting capabilities such as being able to target based on life-changing events. For instance, targeting those who have become recently engaged or married, those turning 65 (Medicare insurance), or those who recently had a new baby are examples of life events that can all be targeted with precision via Facebook ads and not as easily or effective through AdWords. On the other hand, a product or service offering that appeals to larger audiences might be better advertised on AdWords. Brand Recognition Not nearly as important as some other factors, but worth noting and loosely related to the point above. If you are a new company, you are most likely going to be less successful in search compared to a mature, established company in your industry. Why? In this scenario, your competitors have much more brand recognition and brand loyalists. When users see your ad (a company which they do not recognize) and your competitor’s ad (one they do recognize), they will most likely see much more success (i.e. higher click-through rate) in your competitor’s ad. Larry Kim at WordStream wrote a great article on this concept of brand affinity as it relates to search with great insights backed by data. Therefore, make sure you consider your company’s position in the marketplace. You may simply need to build up your brand reputation through Facebook ads and other channels to start, before moving into AdWords to increase your chances of success. A Bonus Chart to Guide You Below is a quick chart to help guide you in making the best decision for your organization between Google AdWords and Facebook Ads. Although there are exceptions to the rule, if your situation steers more to one side or the other, that is the channel you should test first. Conclusion After reading through these points, you will notice that there is not a one-size-fits-all answer to whether you should use AdWords vs. Facebook. When trying to decide between Facebook Ads and Google AdWords for your organization, you need to first take a step back and understand what you are looking to achieve from your investment and your available marketing budget. These are really the two most important factors when considering which channel is best. The other factors are also important and should help support your decision on what is best for your company or brand. Image Credits Featured Image: Created by author Screenshots by Joe Castro.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google says a new version of its Google Photos app introduces several new editing tools for improving photographs. The Google Photos editor already automatically corrects exposure and saturation, but will now also automatically correct white balance. It can sense whether photos are too yellow or too blue and balance them out. Further, the editor makes it possible to manually control white balance with a slider tool. Google says this feature is rolling out to Google Photos on the web and for Android devices this week, with iOS to follow later. more info at Google » Related Google news Android news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

We’ve seen a handful of users getting the changes on their devices, and now it looks like the updated user interface is heading to everyone. It’s worth noting that this interface refresh is a server-side update, and not from a brand new version of the Google Play Store, which basically means that there is very little that users can do to force the Google Play Store to switch over to the new UI. This updated UI makes things a bit simpler. So now there are a few more tabs in the “My Apps & Games” section. There are Updates, Installed, Library, Beta and Family Library. All of which are pretty much self-explanatory, Updates is definitely the most interesting one. This shows you what updates are waiting for you, when the apps got this update, as well as how large the update is. You can choose to update individual apps, or all of them with the “Update All” button at the top. Of course “Installed” shows all of the apps installed on your smartphone right now, “Library” shows everything you’ve ever downloaded. While the “Beta” tab shows all of the beta apps you currently have installed and finally “Family Library” shows the apps that are part of your Family Library. A feature that Google rolled out fairly recently. There are also changes to the visual elements in this change to the “My Apps & Games” section of the Play Store. The layout isn’t as spacious as it used to be. You essentially have one “card” which shows all of the data for all of the apps. This means that users are able to see more data on their device’s display without the need of scrolling down, which is always appreciated. This does mean slightly smaller touch targets, but on a smartphone, that isn’t a terrible thing (that really only matters when you are using your phone in the car while driving, like on Android Auto). This layout does appear to be heading to everyone right now, but it’s unclear how quickly it’ll hit everyone’s device. It’s a staged rollout, so it’ll likely take a bit of time, possibly even a few weeks.

The head of hardware at Google has confirmed that the firm is developing a second-generation Pixel for the ‘premium smartphone market’.  It is believed that the 'Pixel 2' could launch this fall, which would put the handset in direct competition with Apple's iPhone 8. Scroll down for video  The head of hardware at Google has confirmed that the firm is developing a second-generation Pixel (pictured is first-generation Pixel handsets)  for the ‘premium smartphone market’. It is believed that the 'Pixel 2' could launch this fall The confirmation comes from Rick Osterloh during an interview with AndroidPT. ‘There is an annual rhythm in the industry,’ Osterloh said in the interview. ‘So, you can count on us to follow it’ ‘You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now."

Share this article Share 32 shares Google debuted the first smartphones in its Pixel line during a conference in October 2016, a Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Both phones are available in 32 GB ($649 for the Pixel, $769 for the XL) and 128 GB ($749 for the Pixel, $869 for the XL) – prices that surpass Apple’s iPhone line. Although the Pixel 2 release would fall around the same time as the iPhone 8, Google is focusing on the upper price segment of the market. The confirmation comes from Rick Osterloh during an interview with AndroidPT. Google’s second-generation phone (pictured is the original Pixel) would go head-to-head with Apple’s launch of its rumored iPhone 7s and highly-anticipated iPhone 8 Osterloh stated that ‘Pixel stays premium’ and the firm will ‘leave lower price segments to other manufacturers’. The firm launched the Pixel line around the same time as the iPhone 7 was revealed. 'We believe the next big thing will be at the intersection of hardware and software,’ Osterloh said in October. And he also took aim at Apple, saying the phone has 'no unsightly phone bump'. Brian Rakowski of Google said the phone was 'designed inside and out to be smart'. He said the Pixel's new camera was better than the iPhone 7. 'It's the best smartphone camera anyone has made,' he said. GOOGLE PIXEL SPECS  The Pixel runs on a Snapdragon 821 2.15GHz processor. The handsets come in 32GB or 128GB models, with microSD card slots enabling an additional 256GB of storage. The first-generation Pixel is be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip They have 12.3 and 8-megapixel cameras and a full HD AMOLED screen with Gorilla Glass protection. Fast charging gives 7 hours of use in 15 minutes Included is Google's AI assistant, Allo for messaging and Duo for video calls. Free online storage for pictures and video Is be available in US on Verizon and in an unlocked version from $649.  The first-generation handset range includes two new phones, a Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL If a fall release date is in order, Google’s second-generation phone would go head-to-head with Apple’s launch of its rumored iPhone 7s and highly-anticipated iPhone 8 – which could give Google some competition. Apple’s upcoming flagship is said to be packed with cutting-edge technology and have a sleek design. The rumors, which have been surfacing since last year, suggest that the handset will have an OLED wraparound screen, biometric technology and even wireless charging. And although Google has its sights set on the premium market – the iPhone has been speculated to cost $1,000.   Read more: Pixel boss Rick Osterloh: Pixel 2 is coming this year and staying premium - AndroidPIT Share or comment on this article e-mail 32 shares Most watched News videos Leopards attack giant Rock Python in Kruger National Park The Walking Dead: New strain of spice turns homeless into zombies Woman stops car to beat passenger senseless on the road Louis Tomlinson challenges photographer before taking out fan Shocking video shows moment teenager is stabbed in South Norwood Droning on!: Neighbour tries to shoot down spying drone Violent brawl breaks out after man is savagely headbutted to floor Shocking video shows why Coke Zero really is better for you The Manly ferry tackles huge swells over the weekend Dash cam captures close drive-By shooting in Kansas Avalanche crashes down mountain at Russian ski resort Clever dog says 'I love you' to its owner to get treat PIERS MORGAN: Sorry Emma, but you haven’t done yourself...

Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps.

Google today announced that it’s adding an auto white balance feature to Google Photos. As the name implies, the feature will automatically correct the white balance of the photo that you select. Google Photos can also correct your exposure and saturation. If you’d like, you can go into Color and further tweak the Warmth and Tint yourself. The new auto white balance feature will roll out to Google Photos on Android and the web this week. iOS users will get it “soon.” Many photo editing tools offer the ability to tweak your white balance, but not everyone has the time or skill to manually edit their images. This Google Photos update aims to make photo editing easier for those people by adding white balance to the ways that it can automatically improve users’ images.

Phones by Gordon Gottsegen March 2, 2017 1:32 PM PST @ggottsegen Google Assistant rolling out to Android devices now Users of Android 6.0 and higher will find a new feature on their phones with an update that brings along Google's virtual assistant. by Iyaz Akhtar 1:05 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Check your phone: Today, Google Assistant is available to more devices running Android 7.0 Nougat and Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The rollout was announced last week, but Google just released a video ad (see it above), signaling that today's the day more people can start using Google's helper. Unfortunately, Google doesn't say which devices will get the Assistant. If you're lucky, you may already have an update for Google Play Services which contains the new feature. Enlarge Image Google Assistant on the Samsung Galaxy S7, LG V20 and HTC 10. Google Google announced the Google Assistant during its hardware event in October 2016. Google Assistant is a beefed-up smart AI assistant that differs from Google's previous assistant Google Now, and offers a more personal and conversational tone than its predecessor. It can make lists, book reservations and answer follow-up questions, something that Apple's Siri struggles with. At first, Google Assistant was exclusive to the Google Pixel and Pixel XL and advertised as a major selling point for the phone during the event. Google initially had no plans of sharing Google Assistant with other phones, but after months of exclusivity the assistant is coming to other Androids. Don't worry if you don't see the update yet: The feature will first roll out to English users in the US, then Australia, Canada and the UK, then German speakers in Germany, as stated in Google's earlier press release. The company also said in the release that Google Assistant will be available on Samsung, Sony, HTC and Huawei devices, showing renders of Google Assistant on the Samsung Galaxy S7, LG V20 and HTC 10 (hint, hint). Google also showcased the assistant on some of these devices at Mobile World Congress.

The Mountain View City Council will discuss Tuesday whether it will grant Google permits to create its Charleston East campus that will be open to its employees and the public. Google envisions having a canopied 595,000 square foot two-story office building on the 18.6 acre property. The structure would be unlike any office building in the Silicon Valley, made up of “separate roof panels, held up by a grid of poles,” according to a city report released on Friday. “Vertical glass curtain walls would enclose the structure on all four sides, further allowing the inside to be illuminated by natural light,” the report said. Google employees would use offices on the first and second stories of the building. Members of the public would be able to walk through a pathway from dawn to dusk on the first floor, with retail and cafes nearby, the city report said. Renderings from Google included in the report show members of the community doing Tai-chi and a green loop for bicyclists and pedestrians. In the southeast part of the Charleston East campus, near Shoreline Boulevard and Charleston Road, Google plans on having a two-acre public plaza for food trucks and events like performances and outdoor markets, the report said. “Google’s presence in Mountain View is simply so strong that it can’t be a fortress that shuts away nature, that shuts away its neighbors,” said architect Bjarke Ingels, whose firm is a consultant on Google’s campus project, in a video about the space. “It really needs to become a neighborhood in Mountain View.” But as part of its new campus plans, Google plans to remove 196 heritage trees, which requires city approval. Google says it will plant 392 trees, including oak, willow and buckeye trees, to replace the ones that will be removed. The shift in trees will cause a reduction in tree canopy coverage. Currently, there is about 12 percent tree canopy coverage and that will drop to 3 percent at “the time of planting,” the report said. But 15 years later, the tree canopy coverage is expected to grow to 30 percent, the report said. The new project will generate roughly $3 million in additional property tax revenue for the shoreline community, the report said. The project will also pay the city $14.9 million in a housing impact fee and $17.9 million that will go to transportation improvements in North Bayshore, the report said. Google will also pay $250,000 to the city related to its North Bayshore Precise Plan and environmental impact report. Google says Charleston East will have 1,200 parking spaces. On Tuesday, the council will also discuss whether to extend Google’s lease on parking spaces at the Shoreline Amphitheatre to serve as temporary spaces while the project is being developed. Google and Live Nation are seeking to extend a lease on parking spaces at the Shoreline Amphitheatre from Dec. 13, 2017 to the end of 2020. If the city council approves this, Google says it will pay the City of Mountain View a one-time sum of $600,000 and annual rent of $2.25 million for renting the two parking lots. If Google is granted occupancy on its new Charleston East campus before the end of 2020, the $600,000 payment would go toward the rent on the parking lots. In addition, Google says it will restrict parking for Charleston East on its property at 2171 Landings Drive and other Google property near Charleston East campus.

This means that, alongside the ability to see whether a business accepts credit cards, serves alcohol, and is accessible to wheelchairs Google Maps Is Now Wheelchair Friendly Google Maps Is Now Wheelchair Friendly Google has added information regarding wheelchair accessibility to Google Maps. And it's all thanks to the company's famed "20% time". Read More , users will now be able to see whether a business offers gender-neutral bathrooms. Thanks to this additional information, Yelp users will, at a glance, be able to see whether a business offers gender-neutral bathrooms. This information, which will be listed alongside a range of other attributes, will be available on both the desktop and mobile versions of Yelp. Yelp Defines Gender-Neutral Bathrooms Yelp is also adding the option to search for businesses which offer gender-neutral bathrooms. This will help people who exclusively use gender-neutral bathrooms, or those who strongly support their use, to know what to expect ahead of actually visiting the business in question. Yelp regards a restroom as being gender-neutral if it’s a “locking, single-stall bathroom accessible to persons of any gender”. This reflects the fact that more businesses are ripping out their designated male and female restrooms in favor of stalls available to all genders. Yelp will collect this information in two ways. Business owners can simply log into their user account and edit the “Gender Neutral Restrooms” attribute.

Google’s location tracking is better now than ever before Columnist Andy Taylor notes that Google has improved its ability to track search traffic at the ZIP code level, which is good news for advertisers who employ granular geographic targeting. Andy Taylor on March 2, 2017 at 10:47 am More In April 2015, I wrote about Google’s progress in steadily tracking more and more user locations to ZIP codes. As ZIP codes are the most granular location type which populates the “Most specific location” field in AdWords geographic reports, the share of traffic that Google assigns to ZIP codes in this field gives advertisers an idea of how well Google is doing at figuring out searcher locations. At the time, Google was showing strong progress in its location tracking: Fast forward to today, and Google is tracking more searchers to ZIP codes than ever before. However, most of the progress made only applies to google.com traffic, while search partners are continuing to lag in terms of the share of searchers tracked to a ZIP code. One big, huge, ginormous caveat The most important thing to keep in mind with this analysis is that it is based on the locations that Google itself reports. This means that if Google were to, say, expand the use of modeling to infer searcher location to apply to users whose locations it is less confident in, we might see a rise in the share of traffic tracked to a ZIP code without any change in what information Google is actually getting. As such, the trends shown here could be the result of updates Google itself made in assigning and reporting searcher location, rather than Google actually obtaining more granular information on searcher location over time. They could also be the result of a combination of Google changes and more granular information. Google better able to track google.com searcher locations across all device types Across the board, Merkle advertisers are finding more and more traffic attributed to ZIP codes in the “Most specific location” field in AdWords geographic reports. Looking at google.com traffic specifically for one advertiser, we find that while 28 percent of all traffic in Q1 2015 could not be tracked to the ZIP code level in this field, that figure was just 11 percent in Q4 2016. The share of traffic tracked to ZIP code has risen for all device types over the last couple of years: Google continues to track more searchers to the ZIP code level on desktop and tablet computers than on phones, but the gap is now much smaller than it was two years ago. Location tracking users on search partners lagging but getting better Search partner location tracking is also getting better, but no device type topped 80 percent in share tracked to the ZIP code level in Q4 2016. As with google.com searchers, phone searchers are less likely to be tracked to a ZIP code. As such, it’s apparent that Google isn’t always receiving the same information from search partner sites as it gathers when searchers are on Google’s website. It could be that there are specific sites which have issues, or it could be that this is just a complication Google has with all of its search partners. Either way, Google’s progress in tracking search partner user locations at the ZIP code level is rather muted when compared to the significant leaps it has made in tracking searcher locations on its own site. Google average household income targets becoming more powerful Google average household income (HHI) targeting has existed for several years now, and it allows advertisers to target ads and adjust bids based on the average income of the ZIP code a user is searching from using income percentile bundles. In this way, advertisers can target, for example, all of the US searchers which Google can identify as searching from ZIP codes in the top 10 percent in average household income without having to add all of those ZIP codes individually. Since these targets are based on ZIP code location, only those searchers tracked to the ZIP code level are targeted with them. The share of US traffic attributed to income brackets is nearly identical to the share of traffic tracked to the ZIP code level in geographic reports. As such, Google’s progress in location tracking helps these targets account for a greater share of the population. Better tracking is better for advertisers ZIP code certainly isn’t the most granular location Google can track users to. Advertisers can target searchers as close as one kilometer from a specific address using AdWords radius targeting, and Google’s in-store visit tracking relies on tracking searchers to within feet of brick-and-mortar locations in order to credit ad campaigns with driving store visits. However, the share of US traffic that is tracked to ZIP code in the “Most specific location” column gives advertisers an idea of how well Google is able to track users to granular geographic locations. This information helps inform campaign targeting strategy over time. When Google was still only able to track about 70 percent of search traffic to the ZIP code level, advertisers that used only ZIP code-level geographic targeting were missing out on around 30 percent of traffic from those areas. Now that Google tracks much more traffic to the ZIP code level, that’s less of a concern, and advertisers can feel more comfortable using granular location targeting. As mentioned, search partner location tracking lags that of google.com, but search partners only accounted for 9 percent of all Merkle advertiser Google search clicks in Q4 2016. Thus, while we’d prefer to see more progress in location tracking on the partner network, these sites don’t account for a hugely significant share of traffic overall that can’t be identified at the ZIP code level. Whether it’s location or demographic audiences or any other type of search targeting, it’s safe to assume that Google will continue to progress in its ability to track user attributes for better ad targeting. This is a win for advertisers, as campaigns that target specific locations and groups are steadily targeting a greater share of the total population that falls into those locations and groups. It also increases the likelihood that the most correct bids are placed in the AdWords auction for campaigns which target larger geographic areas (such as the entire United States) but use smaller location targets (such as the ZIP code 22902) to adjust bids for users in specific areas. This will only help advertisers to invest more in paid search by helping marketers to spend each dollar as effectively as possible.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Pixel 2 definitely coming this year, still as a premium flagship device By Rei Padla - March 3, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter It was only a couple of days ago when we heard Rick Osterloh saying there won’t be any new Pixel laptop at the moment. The tech giant doesn’t have any plans of releasing a follow-up to the Pixel C anytime soon. We understand the decision but we’re still curious to know if a new Pixel phone will be unveiled at least this 2017. The former President and COO of Motorola Mobility who returned to Google as new hardware SVP last year has been working with the Pixel team and looks like his group will roll out the next-gen Pixel phone. The Google Pixel 2 will be the formal follow-up to the Pixel and Pixel XL. That’s good to know despite reports of delays and some challenges along the way. It’s true that the Google Pixel is still in a bottleneck. We have no idea why exactly but we’ve been saying there is an audio issue and some flaw on the camera. As early as a few weeks ago, we already noted the possibility of a Pixel 2 and the Hardware VP himself is confirming its arrival. As to when, there is no information nor any hint but we’re guessing in the second half of the year. We’re also interested in how the Pixel 2 will be different from the first Pixel duo. The Pixel XL is a bit more powerful with the Daydream AR so we’re hoping the Pixel 2 will also have it as a standard feature. Details are scarce but we are confident that the next-gen Pixel 2 will arrive. This somehow proves that the Pixel phones were not launched as a one-time experiment. As the replacement for the Nexus phones, the Pixel devices better be worth all the hassle and yes, the high cost. We don’t think Google will release a mid-range or budget-friendly Pixel phone since Osterloh already confimred that the line will stay premium.

But it's not all happiness and sweetness, since voice is a commodity and telephony “calling” is now just another feature in a large scheme.  EVS, the next generation of mobile HD voice quality, is expected to grow significantly, according to advocate and EVS patent pool participant Fraunhofer.  It's already included in a number of Qualcomm mobile chipsets, with other vendors expected to add formal support early in 2017.  Phone support today includes the Samsung Note 5, Galaxy S6 and S7 families, Google Pixel, and phones from LG, Sony, HTC, Xiaomi, and HP, among others. Network support for superwideband EVS includes T-Mobile in the U.S., NTT DoCoMo in Japan, Vodafone Germany, and all of the largest South Korean LTE operators. Other mobile operators worldwide are testing EVS and are expected to launch services soon; I suspect we'll have a couple of announcements out around Mobile World Congress (MWC). Voice interfaces and voice assistants have been kicking around for a while on Apple and Google phones, with Cortana coming to the forefront with Windows 10 gains.  But most of the buzz and momentum is with Amazon's Alexa. It doesn't have the deep knowledge and flexibility of Google, but the speakers in the device are great and voice recognition is spot on for both close (near-field) and far away (far-field).   CES was filled with Alexa (and a number of Google Home, to be fair) compatibility announcements, with third-parties able to splice services and devices into Alexa via APIs.  In the near future, you may see “Alexa clones,” hardware built by third-parties but designed specifically to tap into Amazon's Alexa voice recognition/voice assistant functionality.  Amazon gains by having more data flowing into its analytics engines, giving it better information and ways to improve the baseline service.  Every “I don't know the answer to that question” from Alexa is also another “Gee, maybe we should add this feature” for its architects. Perhaps the killer app for Alexa and its Google Home counterpart will be the addition of calling and telephony services. There's been some shade tossed that Amazon needs to “master” things like porting phone numbers and 911 services, but given the mastery of VoIP technology by numerous start-ups (and failed, due to business plan, not tech), it shouldn't be hard.  Companies have been running baseline VoIP services over Amazon Web Services (AWS) for some time. And the talk of adding phone services to Alexa and Google Home should stir the hearts of Ooma and Vonage.  The fastest way to add knowledge, relationships, and VoIP technology (and patents, if you think you need them) is to acquire a company.  Ooma has been running VoIP connected to the legacy phone network for years, so you could check off the 911 support box immediately once you bought it.  However, Ooma also has been doing a lot of expansive things beyond stock phone calls, including home monitoring and... linking Alexa to Ooma.   Imagine buying an Alexa and getting Ooma phone calling built-in.  All the vital bits already exist between the Alexa voice front end and Ooma's telephony network, with Ooma as an Alexa still released back in 2016. Yes, I think Amazon should buy Ooma.  It's a great fit, especially when you consider Ooma also has built its own bespoke hardware and added to its portfolio over the years. The only downside to voice calling is that there's no money to squeeze out of it and little sizzle.  When I was at ITEXPO a couple weeks ago, long-time VoIP guru and start-up patron Andy Abramson shared a discussion he recently had with a VoIP cloud provider.   About a decade or so ago, Andy told the company that there was a list of dozens of go-to reporters dedicated to covering the VoIP space.  Today, publications are interested in the hot trinity of AI, The Internet of Things (IoT), and cybersecurity – not VoIP or voice. Voice is just another building block, from my perspective.  It needs to work correctly when interwoven with other applications, but there's no “secret sauce” or revolutionary breakthroughs needed for high-quality voice and speech-to-text that feed into natural language processing and voice analytics engines. This isn't to say companies can't make a good living doing cloud PBX services, but voice telephony is a commodity world that runs on pennies to fractions of a penny for profit.  That's a harsh business, requiring economies of scale and the size of an Amazon or other cloud provider to truly make healthy profits.

Matt McGee on March 3, 2017 at 2:11 pm More All eyes were on Snap this week, as the parent company of Snapchat had a successful IPO on Thursday that immediately valued the company above non-tech stalwarts like CBS, Delta Airlines, Target and others. But there are legitimate questions about the future of advertising on Snapchat and how well the social platform can continue to monetize its userbase. In this week’s episode of Marketing Land Live, we talk about what Snap’s IPO might mean for digital advertisers and some of the hurdles the company may have to overcome to attract more ad dollars. Other topics this week include the announcement of YouTube TV and how video advertising will work when it launches, and the relationship between fake news/hyperpartisan web sites and the Google Display Network.

The word from Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of hardware at the search giant, is the Google Pixel 2 will indeed release this year. He revealed as much to Android Pit during a conversation at this week's MWC conference.  Osterloh said we can "count on" Google following the industry's annual release cycle when it comes to the handset, at least for the 2017 edition.  "You can count on a successor this year," he said of Pixel, "even if you don't hear a date from me now." Staying premium Osterloh also said Google doesn't plan to turn the Pixel into a lower-tier device: "Pixel stays premium," he proclaimed. Apparently when pressed, Osterloh never deviated from his response that Pixel is a premium product. Google will let other hardware makers battle it out for cheaper phone supremacy. This may be disappointing to some who were hoping for a budget Pixel. Rumors suggested a cheaper version was in the works, but it appears Osterloh has put those to bed. Never say never, however, as Google could surprise with a budget Pixel edition down the line. As for the Pixel 2, Osterloh didn't offer up any details on what we can expect from the phone. Previous reports suggest it will be a significant upgrade, especially in the camera and chipset departments, and that one or both versions of the Pixel 2 may even go waterproof.

This week, we follow up on the launch of Google’s new ad label to ask how it will impact marketers, and look at attempts by Google’s tech incubator Jigsaw to clean up language on the internet. Plus, a new study has revealed that 63% of top-ranking websites use keywords in their URL, and Bing has a new function that allows you to filter restaurants by Pokéstop. How will Google’s new ‘Ad’ label impact marketers? In last week’s round-up we reported that after some testing, Google has officially rolled out a new look for its ad labels on the SERP. But the question on everyone’s lips is: how will this affect marketing campaigns? Clark Boyd took a detailed look at the possible implications of the chance for Search Engine Watch this week, including considering why Google has chosen to change the look of the ad labels, the impact it will have on paid search CTR, and the possible effect on organic search. Google’s Jigsaw aims to increase the quality of online conversations Jigsaw, the technology incubator formerly known as Google Ideas, has launched an API which aims to rid the web of bad comments. Called Perspective, the API “uses machine learning models to score the perceived impact a comment might have on a conversation” and can be used to identify and filter out comments that are likely to be “toxic.” When fed the content of a comment, the API will give a percentage rating as to how similar it is to “toxic” comments. Perspective uses machine learning models to determine the likelihood of a comment being toxic. Needless to say there has been some skepticism over how well this model can work, but it’s already being tested out by a number of prominent publishers, including the likes of the New York Times, the Guardian and Wikipedia. Al Roberts took a look at the issue for ClickZ, and considered whether a human issue like online abuse can really be solved by machines. Google’s DeepMind app is saving NHS nurses two hours a day There was significant controversy surrounding DeepMind, the Artificial Intelligence arm of Google, last November when it was revealed to be at the center of a massive data-sharing agreement involving the medical information of more than 1.6 million patients. But the NHS Royal Free London Hospital, which is trialing an app by DeepMind designed to detect early signs of kidney failure, has spoken out in defense of the technology and revealed that it is saving nurses up to two hours every day. The logo for Streams, the real-time health information app by DeepMind. Wired UK reported that more than 26 doctors and nurses at Royal Free are using the app, which is “alerting” them up to 11 times per day of patients at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). According to NHS figures, acute kidney disease costs them more than £1 billion every year – although it’s unknown how much the NHS is paying DeepMind for the use of its technology. “Within a few weeks of being introduced, nurses who have been using Streams report it has been saving them up to two hours every day, which means they can spend more time face-to-face with patients,” the hospital said in a statement.

Study: 63% of top-ranking websites use keywords in their URL How beneficial is it to have keywords in your domain URL? There has been little definitive information to answer this question over the years. Matt Cutts and John Mueller, both of Google, have previously gone on record (one in 2009, and the other in 2016) to state that keywords do make some contribution to search ranking. But what does this look like in practice, and how does it vary across different industries? A study by HigherVisibility, shared exclusively with Search Engine Watch, set out to answer this very question, analyzing the top ranking websites for various keywords across ten major industries. The study found that nearly two-thirds (63%) of top-ranked websites use keywords in their domain URL. Of the industries studied, the debt industry had the highest incidence of keywords in domain URLs with 76%, while email marketing had the lowest, with 47%. Read the full write-up and analysis of the findings. Bing lets you filter restaurants by Pokéstop What are the qualities of the ideal restaurant? Good food, ambiance…. nearby Pokéstop? If you would pick the last of these, you’re in luck, because Bing now allows you to filter restaurants by whether or not they have a Pokéstop nearby. The SEM Post’s Jennifer Slegg was the one to notice the change, which hasn’t been publicized by Bing in any way. So far the feature is only available in US search, but it could be a boost for some businesses. Wired reported in September 2016 that one in 10 US smartphone users were still playing the game, and a slew of new Pokémon have been introduced since then. Maybe now would be a good time to splurge on a lure or two. Rebecca Sentance is the Deputy Editor at ClickZ and Search Engine Watch.

Krieger | lkrieger@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 3, 2017 at 8:58 am | UPDATED: March 6, 2017 at 11:35 am Google is using the power of computer-based reasoning to detect breast cancer, training the tool to look for cell patterns in slides of tissue, much the same way that the brain of a doctor might work. New findings show that this approach — enlisting machine learning, predictive analytics and pattern recognition — has achieved 89 percent accuracy, beyond the 73 percent score of a human pathologist. Related Articles Google researcher identified as motorcycle crash victim Apple, Google, Tesla and others threatened by expected Trump tariff or tax Google’s YouTube TV launching “soon”: 40-plus channels for $35 per month Google self-driving car spin-off Waymo sues Uber, accuses ex-manager of stealing files Murder of Google’s Vanessa Marcotte: DNA profile of killer released “We showed that it was possible to train a model that either matched or exceeded the performance of a pathologist who had unlimited time to examine the slides,” according to a blog item in Google Research posted by technical lead Martin Stumpe and product manager Lily Peng. Pathologists have always faced a huge data problem in obtaining an accurate diagnosis. A massive amount of information — slides containing cells from tissue biopsies, thinly sliced and stained — must be scanned in search of any abnormal cells. And time is of the essence. There can be many slides per patient. And each slide contains more than 10 gigapixels when digitized at 40 times magnification, according to the Google team. “Imagine having to go through a thousand 10-megapixel photos, and having to be responsible for every pixel,” the team wrote. As a result, even well-trained doctors may arrive at different conclusions, or miss the small percentage of images crucial to identifying pathologies. For example, agreement in diagnosis for some forms of breast cancer and prostate cancer can be as low as 48 percent, according to Google. Google’s approach is to input vast amounts of data into its system, then train it to look for patterns. It’s called “deep learning” — a family of computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a large set of examples that demonstrate what needs to be done. The Google team found that the system can autonomously learn what pathology looks like. The computer was educated by studying billions of images donated from Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands. Its algorithms were optimized for localization of breast cancer that has spread, or metastasized, to lymph nodes adjacent to the breast. Google Research’s work offers the latest proof that artificial intelligence no longer exists just in the realm of science fiction, but can be used to help humans. Research teams are embedded throughout Google to tackle tough problems, using computer science to confront related challenges through data-mining and artificial intelligence. Previously, the team applied deep learning to create an algorithm for automated detection, by scanning photos, of retinal damage in patients with diabetes. Other companies are also exploring the field. IBM — which developed the Watson technology that triumphed on the TV show “Jeopardy!” — has shown that its system can autonomously learn what a pathology looks like — say, abnormal narrowing in a coronary artery, according to Technology Review,  published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The computer’s education is being sped up by studying 30 billion images from hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations that IBM recently acquired in its $1 billion purchase of Merge Healthcare, the journal reported. Computers won’t replace doctors, Google said. They lack a human’s breadth of knowledge and experience. For example, a computer can’t detect abnormalities that it hasn’t been trained to classify, such as different types of cancer. But perhaps a computer could automatically alert the doctor to the most important images. Or it could help doctors more easily and accurately measure tumor size — a factor that is linked to prognosis. “To ensure the best clinical outcome for patients, these algorithms need to be incorporated in a way that complements the pathologist’s workflow,” the Goggle team wrote.

Naturally, you delivered, so now we’re here to provide you with our answers.  This week, questions ranged in topic, covering what we expect from Google I/O this year, at what price the LG G6 is a good buy, and if Android Wear 2.0 has reinvigorated our love for Google’s smartwatch platform. Oh, we also got asked about beer, too. Awesome. Let’s get to it. Reminder: K is Kellen, T is Tim. What are your expectations for I/O this year? K:  Google Assistant everywhere. My guess is that Google Home will see a bunch of new features too, or we’ll see partners build Assistant into other products like Home. In other words, Assistant will be opened up on some level because Google will have to if it ever wants to try and catch Amazon. I also think we might see this merging of Chrome OS and Android in some form. Google can keep denying it all they want, but it makes a lot of sense to have the wealth of Android apps available to Chromebooks and not in this super janky beta state we have had since last IO. T:  Well, not to downplay anything that took place last year, but it was on the boring side. The biggest things announced were Google Home, Android Wear 2.0, and Google Assistant. To me, Google Home is awesome, but it relates directly to Google Assistant. The same for Android Wear 2.0. What makes that update special is support for Google Assistant. Even Allo, for example, has Assistant, too! To sum it up, I/O 2016 was about a digital assistant. For me, I’m ready for something bigger and better. The LG G6 looks like a good phone. At what price point is it a good buy? K:  Well, Google is still selling the Pixel from $650, yet the G6 features so much more like IP68 water resistance, a bigger higher-res display, dual cameras, and an ultra premium design that isn’t an iPhone clone. I’d say it’s probably worth at least $650, probably even more. I know that some will complain about the Snapdragon 821, but that chipset isn’t really that old. I doubt Qualcomm has offered some massive discount on the 821 to OEMs. It’d be nice to get it at $600, I just don’t think LG can do that. T:  Reports from Korea say that its G6 model will be priced at 899,800 KRW, which converts to about $780. To me, that’s bad news for LG. You’re asking folks to pay Samsung and Apple prices for something they may not be sure about. If it was up to me, which it isn’t, I’d shoot for $599. However, considering the features it has (IP68, wireless charging, dual cameras), I don’t see LG being able to meet such a competitive price. When you offer high-end specs and features, you have to charge reasonably for it. Does LG have the marketing power to convince US consumers to spend nearly $800 on their smartphone? We’ll find out soon enough. What’s your go to beer at the moment? K:  Block 15 Sticky Hands. Best IPA in the business in my opinion. T:  Occidental’s Hefeweizen. Yum yum! If you could live anywhere else in the world, where would it be? K:  I don’t know that I’ve ever really thought about it, but probably some place warm that doesn’t rain 800 days per year like Portland. While I love Portland, living on a beach and seeing the sun most days would be a solid life. T:  I’d love a spot in the woods. Northern California, probably. My original home. Thoughts on the return of the Nokia 3310? K:  Couldn’t care less. T:  There’s a reason it’s not coming to the US. It’s dumb. Name a movie that you hate but everyone else seems to love. K:  Avatar. T:  I can’t think of a movie right off, but I can give you a TV show: Westworld. It’s cool enough, but I’m not in love with its storytelling the same way others appear to be. What’s your take on bezel-less displays? Gimmick or awesome? K:  After using the LG G6 for most of the week, I think this is a smart way to do it. The phone has almost all display that’s flat, but there are still bezels that allow you to not accidentally press the side of a display every time you grab the phone. I’m actually worried about the Galaxy S8 and am assuming that its curved, zero-edge display is going to be a nightmare for accidental presses. T:  The G6’s display and design is no gimmick. It’s actually quite nice. Provided there’s no curving going on, it makes handling the phone very easy. I share Kellen’s concerns about Samsung’s implementation on the Galaxy S8. I shall reserve judgement, though. Thoughts on Android Wear 2.0? Enough to bring you back? K:  Outside of the UI changing a bit upfront, it’s really not a huge change overall. Everything still works mostly the same. NFC in some watches for payments will be a nice addition, but there still isn’t a lot there to get people on board, I don’t think. The big complaints we still have are mostly around battery life and charging. Wear 2.0 certainly doesn’t fix that. T:  I have yet to see a smartwatch that gets me excited about Android Wear again. The last time I felt good about it was the Huawei Watch and Moto 360 (OG and 2nd Gen). The new Huawei Watch looks pretty terrible and the Watch Sport is just too big. The OS itself is fine for me, it’s cool, but the hardware needs to be even better. C’mon, OEMs, you can do better! Check out our previous Q&A posts!

Also, try not to be so bashing on struggling companies, other than maybe Saygus. I’ve heard Tim awhile back talk about wanting a certain big brand to “just die already”, then later say he wants an companies to succeed. More players in the game equals more push for new innovations and more choice. Imagine if it was just Apple and Samsung. It would be a very boring time and tough for you to write posts.

The news comes from Rick Osterloh, Google’s senior vice president of hardware, via AndroidPIT. Osterloh couldn’t announce a release date for the successor to the Pixel but confirmed plans for the new smartphone lineup. “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it.” Osterloh said to AndroidPIT. “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now.” Osterloh also confirmed Google would keep the Pixel 2 at a similar premium price. Right now, the Google Pixel’s retail hardware starts at $649 and phones with a lower price point are left to alternative manufacturers like LG and Samsung. The news comes as Google finds the Pixel smartphone series in a tricky position. Since its release last fall, the Pixel and Pixel XL have earned strong marks from reviewers but the smartphones have been plagued by inventory issues and models have frequently been out of stock. While Google has dabbled with taking a more direct hardware role in the past via the Nexus series, the Pixel is a de facto flagship device for the company. For Google, the company took on a much more hands-on approach during the design and hardware development process. As the Pixel 2 aims to target the same upscale audience, it’s clear that Google wants the phone to continue to be in same discussion as market leaders like Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy series.

Home World news Good news: Tech giant Google raises file atttachment size in Gmail accounts to 50 MB Good news: Tech giant Google raises file atttachment size in Gmail accounts to 50 MB The US-based tech giant has increased the attachment size of its mailing service from 25 MB to 50 MB. By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: March 4, 2017 12:03 AM The step has been taken as many account holders send their data through emails. (Reuters) The US-based tech giant has increased the attachment size of its mailing service from 25 MB to 50 MB, a report by News18.com has said. As per the report, the step has been taken as many account holders send their data through emails. However, the company has limited this feature only for emails ‘received’ by account users and anyone mailing an attached file has to adjust with the current 25 MB limit, the report added. In February, Google has announced that its Gmail service will stop working on some Chrome browsers by the end of 2017. According to a blog posted by Google, it has informed that Gmail will stop working on 53 or lower version of its Chrome browser. The process of stopping Gmail for working on these versions will start from February 8 itself. This move by Google, essentially means that it’s time for Windows XP and Windows Vista users, to start worrying, as they will not be able to use the emailing feature of Google on their Chrome browser. It had also said that the Chrome browser’s versions lower than 53 were open to security risks, mainly because Microsft had stopped the OS support for Windows XP and Vista. This means that if you are still using Chrome v53 or lower, be ready to likely get affected by attacks. Moreover, there will be no bug fixes or security patches available to you. According to Google, you will be able to continue using the Chrome browser till the end of the year, but it will be in the basic HTML version only. Google wrote on the blog, “Gmail users that are still on Windows XP and Windows Vista are the most likely to be affected because v49 was the last released version which supported those operating systems.” You may also like to watch this vdeo Google said that Gmail users who are still on Chrome browser v53 or below will be flashed a message or banner on their screens. In the blog post, Google said, “Google does not typically announce when we discontinue support for older versions of Chrome browser because of our current supported browser policy, which states that only the most recent versions of Chrome are supported. This announcement was made given the expected impact on Windows XP and Windows Vista users and known security risks.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Mar 3, 2017 at 1:15PM Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that is still in the early stages of adoption. While headsets are available, VR has yet to gain wide acceptance due to the high cost of consoles and equipment, and the lack of sufficient content. Additionally, the technology is still largely unfamiliar to the majority of consumers, who may have heard of VR but have yet to experience it. All that may be beginning to change. Pearl is the first VR movie to be nominated for an Oscar. Image source: Google. For the first time, a movie created specifically to be viewed in VR was nominated for an Academy Award. Though the film didn't win, it may act as a touchstone for consumers. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Spotlight Stories, a VR storytelling venue, has for the last several years produced 360-degree and VR films in the form of animated shorts. This allowed filmmakers to reimagine storytelling and for technicians from Google's Advanced Technology and Projects group (ATAP) to hone the nascent technology.  Its Oscar-nominated short, Pearl, is centered on the life and times of a musical father and daughter traveling the country in pursuit of stardom. The animated scenes all take place from the point-of-view of a passenger in the front seat of their car. The ground-breaking film was directed by Patrick Osbourne who received an Oscar in 2015 for his work on Walt Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Feast, a short film about a man and his adopted dog, which debuted in 2014. This highlights a recent push by filmmakers and the movie industry to embrace the technology.  Meanwhile, legendary director Steven Spielberg is fronting a new VR start-up, Dreamscape Immersive, which recently raised $11 million in funding from several Hollywood studios. Focusing on location-based virtual reality, the company plans to open a VR multiplex in Los Angeles later this year. This comes on the heels of a similar location-based offering that is the result of a partnership between Google and IMAX Corporation (NYSE:IMAX). The companies joined forces to create a cinema grade VR camera using Google's Jump platform which seamlessly integrates 360-degree video into a panoramic view. Last month, IMAX opened its pilot VR center in Los Angeles and based on its early success, the company plans to open five additional test locations by mid-year. This model incorporates original material, as well as content that expands on big budget films, such as Disney's Star Wars series, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.'s John Wick movies, and Hasbro's Transformers franchise.  Samsung Gear VR. Image source: Samsung.  In another sign that VR is gaining a wider audience Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) released apps for its leading streaming service that will work with several commercially available headsets including the Facebook's Oculus Rift, Samsung's Gear VR, and Google Daydream View.  The app features a virtual living room where viewers can connect with the familiar Netflix interface to select programs for viewing. Website ScreenRant.com detailed a list of movies that lend themselves to VR, without being specific to the technology. While Netflix is not providing any actual VR content, this is an acknowledgement that the public may be ready for more in the way of interacting with VR technology. VR is still in its infancy and it will be some time before it gains widespread adoption. Hollywood is leading the charge with location-based options that will supplement the home VR market. This provides evidence that the technology is gaining ground, and the tipping point may be closer than we imagine.

Blocks ads. Smart settings automatically connect VPN on unsecured networks. Subscription handled by Google Play. Average speed test results. Cons Expensive. Limited subscription options. Bottom Line Norton WiFi Privacy delivers a reasonably compelling VPN service, but it can be an expensive proposition. By Max Eddy Whether you're on your computer or your phone, you should use a virtual private network to protect your data while it's in transit. Norton WiFi Privacy is an Android app that safely secures you and your network traffic when you're on the go. It has some excellent features, including ad blocking and automatic VPN connections, but it requires a high up-front investment. For better value in Android VPNs, you should look look to our Editors' Choice winners NordVPN and Private Internet Access VPN. //Compare Similar Products Compare NordVPN (for Android)   %displayPrice%%seller% Private Internet Access VPN (for Android)   %displayPrice%%seller% ExpressVPN (for Android)   %displayPrice%%seller% KeepSolid VPN Unlimited (for Android)   %displayPrice%%seller% Hide My Ass VPN (for Android)   %displayPrice%%seller% Spotflux VPN (for Android)   %displayPrice%%seller% What Is a VPN? When you connect to the free Wi-Fi network at a coffee shop, you're probably not overly concerned with security. But if the network isn't secured, it's possible that one of the other patrons is spying on your every move as you surf the Web, learning your passwords, banking information, and secrets. There's also no way to tell if the network you're connecting to is even being run by the coffee shop. It could just be a cleverly named surrogate, created to lure patrons like yourself into connecting. This kind of man-in-the-middle attack is more common than you might think. At the Black Hat security conference, I saw first hand how even trained security professionals, hackers, and passersby fell for what was clearly a bogus network. This particular attack took advantage of the fact that many phones and computers will automatically try to reconnect to familiar networks. By mimicking any network ID a victim requests, the attacker captures connections. It's a convenient feature, but one that opens you up to attack. A VPN can't protect you against every threat, but it's a simple and effective way to lock down your network security. With a VPN, your traffic is routed through a secure and encrypted tunnel to the VPN service's server. From there, it enters the wide and wild Internet. The practical upshot is that anyone on your local network or monitoring your connection to the VPN's server won't be able to peek at your data. VPNs also provide a modicum of privacy. Should attackers or advertisers try to gather your IP address or discern your location, they'll see the info for the VPN server instead. This facet of VPN services also means that you can spoof your location by connecting to a far-flung VPN server. Political activists and journalists use this feature to reach the rest of the world when operating within countries with restrictive Internet laws. The average person can use this to access region-locked content, like Major League Baseball live streams or BBC programming. Features and Pricing The Norton WiFi Privacy app is free to download from Google Play, but you won't be able to do anything with the app unless you spring for a $29.99 year-long subscription. Thankfully, there's a seven-day free trial but you'll have to authorize the app as if you were paying for it up front. The subscription and payments are entirely app based and handled through Google Play. That means that you pay for it the same you would any other in-app purchase. It's a little counter-intuitive, however, because Google makes it appear as if you are going to be charged immediately when in reality you have a seven-day trial period. If you want to cancel your subscription, you can do so easily through the Account section of the Google Play app. Norton does not offer any other billing options, which is unfortunate. Most other services let you choose between a monthly billing cycle and a prorated annual billing option. KeepSolid VPN Unlimited goes further, offering billing options that cover just a few days—a great choice for travelers looking to get just a few days of protection. I much prefer these more flexible plans. If you opt to purchase Norton WiFi Privacy from Norton's website, you'll find a few more pricing options. A yearly subscription for one device costs $49.99, currently marked down to $39.99. Five devices costs $79.99, also currently marked down to $39.99. 10 devices runs $99.99, currently marked down to $59.99. Note that these lower rates are just for the first year. After that, they'll jump up to their usual levels. Importantly, these subscriptions can be used to cover other Android devices, PCs, Macs, and iOS devices, too. Norton also offers a 60-day money back guarantee, twice the duration of the competition, and a $119.98 ($79.98 for the first year) bundle that includes Norton Security Deluxe with five licenses for both products. Note that if you purchase a subscription through the Android app, it won't work for other devices. The slightly more expensive subscription on the Norton website is the way to go if you also want to protect PCs, Macs, Android, and iOS devices. Some services, such as TorGuard, go even further, offering routers with VPN software preinstalled, providing protection for every device connected to the network. TorGuard also provides five devices in its base subscription with the option to add additonal devices for a fee. While that $29.99 price tag can look intimidating, it works out to about $2.50 a month. That's well below nearly every other service's monthly billing option, but doesn't beat out other services when you look at their annual plans. Spotflux VPN and KeepSolid offer plans for $4.99 a month or annual plans for $25 and $29.99, respectively. There are even free VPN services that are worth investigating, if price is a major issue. Norton also has comparatively few servers in even fewer locations. According to Norton, the company currently offers 25 server locations with at least two different servers in each location. To its credit, Norton has a geographically diverse collection of server locations, touching Africa, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and the South Pacific. No matter where you travel, you're sure to find at least one server on the same continent. But for international travelers, or users keen to spoof their location to specific locales, this will not be enough. Editors' Choice winner Private Internet Access, on the other hand, has thousands of servers in hundreds of locations across the globe. The number and location of servers matters a lot. If you're using a VPN, you want a server close by in order to reduce latency and to have a better overall experience. If you're interested in spoofing your location, numerous servers and locations give you more options. A solid offering of servers also opens the door for specialized servers. Editors' Choice Winner NordVPN, for example, has specific servers for watching videos, accessing the Tor network, and exchanging files over BitTorrent (or the P2P network of your choice)—even when using your Android device. Norton doesn't allow file sharing, nor does it have specific servers for different activities. Hands On With Norton WiFi Privacy With its Android app, Norton offers a clean, focused experience. The app is centered around a large circle showing the current location of your Web traffic. Page elements are colored red or green depending on whether or not the VPN is active. The color changes stand out starkly in the app's sparse design, which is smart and eye-catching. A typical Android power button sits in the lower right corner in typical material design style. Buttons across the top give quick access to app settings, location information, and ad-blocking controls. One of the best features of the app is the ability to have Norton automatically activate the VPN whenever your phone connects to an unsecured Wi-Fi network. If you're not a fan of automation, you can toggle this off and opt to receive warnings about the network's lack of security instead. Ad-blocking software is currently unavailable in the official Google Play store, meaning you cannot escape the tyranny (or necessity, depending on your point of view) of Web ads on your Android device. Apple, it should be noted, does allow ad-blocking apps like 1Blocker, which blocks ads in the Safari browser. Some VPN services, including Norton, will block ads, making them rare and valuable commodities for Android devotees. Of the VPN apps I've tested, Private Internet Access and Spotflux VPN are the only others that also block ads on Android. By default, Norton WiFi Privacy will select the closest VPN server to your current location. Proximity can have a major impact on performance, and a closer server usually ensures a better experience. Some users, however, may want to make it appear as if their Web traffic is coming from somewhere else. To do that, you can manually select from a list and the app will connect. Other VPN services offer many more servers and locations, as well as search functions, speed tests, and specialized servers. Norton's offering is adequate in this regard, but I hope to see it grow in the future. Speed Tests Using a VPN will have some effect on your Internet connection. In most cases, the strain of bouncing data to a remote server and back again increases latency and lowers download and upload speeds. In some rare cases, VPNs can improve Web performance, usually by connecting you to higher bandwidth infrastructure. When testing VPNs on desktop computers, I found that PureVPN greatly increased download speeds, for example. I have yet to see this effect with an Android VPN, however. VPNs can secure cellular traffic, too, but cellular connections are harder to control in a lab environment. In my testing, I shut off the cellular radio on my Nexus 5x before running a series of speed tests using the Ookla app (Ookla is owned by PCMag publisher Ziff Davis). VPN protection for cellular connections is important because an attacker with a good amount of technical know-how, a portable cell tower such as a Femtocell, and a broad-spectrum jammer could intercept your cellular data. This is, as readers will no doubt guess, a rather exotic attack—but it's not unheard of. All of my tests use the automatically selected server, which in this case was located in Kansas. Your mileage, particularly in other countries, may vary. I found that the Norton WiFi Privacy app increased network latency by 342.2 percent. That's a significant increase, but not the worst I have seen by far. The NordVPN Android app had the lowest latency of any mobile VPN I've yet tested, increasing latency by only 32 percent. Norton was not the fastest VPN the download or upload tests. I found it decreased download speeds by 54.5 percent. The Private Internet Access app has the best score in this test, decreasing download speeds by only 10.3 percent. Norton's performance was, however, on the higher end of average for this test. In the upload test, Norton slowed uploads by 58.3 percent, making it the second slowest uploading mobile VPN I've yet tested. The Spotflux VPN Android app actually improved upload performance, increasing upload speeds by 6.5 percent. Numbers are just numbers; it's the experience that really matter. During my time with Norton WiFi Privacy I found that media-heavy pages seemed to load nearly as quickly as they did without VPN. Web-optimized pages, like Google's AMP pages, loaded almost instantaneously. Unfortunately, I found that Netflix was blocked when I was using Norton WiFi Privacy. The same is true for nearly every other VPN service (and the associated Android apps) I've tested. At issue is geographic-specific licensing deals Netflix carries out. Show and movie availability varies by country, due to the way licenses are negotiated. Room to Grow Norton WiFi Privacy has a great design, a friendly interface, and a familiar sign-up process that's sure to put users at ease. I particularly like its ad-blocking powers, and its ability to automatically activate VPN protection when you connect to an unsecured Wi-Fi network. Norton's recent addition of new platforms for WiFi privacy, including desktops and iPhones, make it a more useful option, too. My enthusiasm is offset, however, by the service's inflexible and relatively high up-front price, its limited number of servers, and its limited subscription options. For now, I'll continue to recommend Editors' Choice VPN Android apps NordVPN and Private Internet Access.

Cons Six-month licensing. Bottom Line Mind mapping software solution Expert Software Applications Mindomo is the Editors' Choice winner for its Comments feature that strengthens its social prowess and mind-mapping power. By Evan Koblentz, Suzanne Kattau Expert Software Applications Mindomo is an mind mapping and idea management software that's available in cloud and desktop versions. I tested the cloud version because the desktop version requires Adobe Air, which is not widely supported. Expert Software Applications Mindomo begins at $36 per user for a six-month-long license. Fortunately, the product itself is all business and wins our Editors' Choice award in this mind mapping software solution review roundup. And, unusually, Expert Software Applications Mindomo licenses are sold in 6-month increments. That is my only major complaint; why not make them available in year-long increments? There are Premium, Professional, and Team versions. Licenses cost $36 per user, $90 per user with five guests, and $162 for five users, respectively. There is special pricing for academic customers. //Compare Similar Products Compare Bloomfire   %displayPrice%%seller% XMind   %displayPrice%%seller% Front & Main Honey   %displayPrice%%seller% Mindjet MindManager 2016 for Windows   %displayPrice%%seller% Ideaflip   %displayPrice%%seller% Corso Innovation Management   %displayPrice%%seller% Datastation Innovation Cloud   %displayPrice%%seller% iMindQ   %displayPrice%%seller% Idearium   %displayPrice%%seller% Setting Up Using solely the cloud version requires you to visit the website and log in with MindManager or Google credentials. You can select your preferred language and create new maps, starting with more than 50 themes in basic, business, and education categories. Access existing maps by using the import feature or by clicking on maps that other users share with you. Alternately, you can get more maps from the Expert Software Applications website. Users can also customize their default views and calendar availability for task assignments. Interface and Usability At first glance, the Mindomo interface seems sparse. Across the top, I found menus for returning to the start-up dashboard, standard file management tools, undo/redo, insert a topic or relationship, share, view changes (which are similar features found in XMind), or view as a presentation. On the left-hand side, there are icons for adding notes, links, images, tasks, and so forth. I can imagine the notes feature being very useful. Users can install browser extensions for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. The map itself has novel features. A playback mode shows which users made what changes and when they made them. In this mode, a chat feature becomes available when multiple users are online simultaneously, and there is a bookmarks feature for storing content that you might use in different maps (so you don't have to go find it every time). You will also find a markers feature, which offers a variety of map icons but isn't quite as useful as the markers in XMind. Download and print options are there when you right-click in any blank part of a map. You'd think this is common, but in Mindomo, it is very simple and the file format options are surprisingly plentiful. Maps can be shared in formats such as HTML and RSS, and there is Google Docs and Office 365 integration (along with other backup functions to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneBox, or an FTP account). Plus, there's additional integration with learning applications. Maps can be password protected as well. Map leaves are condensed to show only their titles and subjects, with full details being viewable by clicking a plus sign. The application's secret weapon is an unassuming icon labeled Comments. This opens a resizable window in which you can comment on any part of a map and "like" or "dislike" any particular leaf. Effectively, that combines the social prowess of the Bloomfire and Front & Main Honey approach with the mapping powers of XMind and Mindjet MindManager 2016 for Windows—the best of both worlds. This one feature is what separates Expert Software Applications Mindomo from its competition. I'd like to see it adopted by other companies. Meanwhile, Mindomo would be smart to make the feature prominent, instead of leaving it as just another bland icon in a navigation bar. Expert Software Applications Mindomo's mobile applications are very straightforward. I tried the Android version which loads into an interface almost identical to the desktop version. It is simple to access your own maps or content that other users shared with you. A downside is the mobile menu icons are too small to comfortably select, even on my relatively huge Galaxy Note screen. I hope that is adjusted in a future version. In addition to regular help menus, Expert Software Applications Mindomo has an online customer discussion forum. Major categories are general discussion (these are mostly how-to posts), feature requests, and bug submissions. Among the feature requests, there are so many good ideas that it makes me long to see Expert Software Applications Mindomo offer a software developer kit (SDK). In the bugs category, it is somewhat concerning to see so many posts, but it's a pleasure when any software company is so transparent of their issues. Company officials said that some of the features due in the near future include analysis of cause/effect changes to maps, more customization for map label elements, a way to transform maps into outlines (which is already part of XMind and Mindjet MindManager 2016 for Windows), and a way to plan and predict logic debates. Conclusion Expert Software Applications Mindomo wins an Editors' Choice award because their product includes powerful aspects of mind mapping software coupled with the social aspects of knowledge management services. It is the only product in the five reviewed in this roundup that touches both sides of the social or mapping fence. This is what the wider category of mind mapping applications should always aim to do. However, I'm giving it a score of 4 out of 5—which is higher than the other products in this review but still leaves room for improvement. Expert Software Applications Mindomo could be considered the least-flawed product of the bunch. Its foray into social networking is unique but still doesn't touch the abilities of Bloomfire or Front & Main Honey.

Name: Subject: Message: Android Studio 2.3 has a bunch of improvements for app developers Android Development Newsby John Callaham4 days ago 2 2904 13 Android app developers now have a new version of Google’s Android Studio tools to check out. The company released the new 2.3 version earlier this week, and Google says that it concentrates on offering improvements to the tools, although there are a few small new features thrown in as well. See also: How to build an image gallery app – full tutorial with code October 3, 2016 In case you didn’t know, Android Studio is Google’s official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for making Android apps, including tools for coding the app and design software for creating its user interface. Android Studio 2.3 includes some improvements and changes to Instant Run. Developers who use the “Run” action will now always cause an application restart, so they can see any changes in the app’s code that may require a restart. Also, there’s a new “Apply Changes” action that will make changes to that code while the app itself continues to run. Build Cache has now been turned on by default in Android Studio 2.3, after first being introduced in the previous 2.2 version. This new feature is designed to give developers a way to cache exploded AARs and pre-dexed external libraries, which in turn should lead to faster clean builds of their apps. The UI design tools in Android Studio 2.3 include support for Constraint Layout, which will allow developers to chain two or more Android views bi-directionally together to form a group on one dimension. Constraint Layout also support ratios for developers who want to maintain the aspect ratio of a widget. There’s lots of other improvements and small additions in this Android Studio 2.3 release, including an updated widget palette in the Layout Editor, the addition of  search and filtering in the vector asset wizard, and a new App Links Assistant that lets developers create new intent filters for their URLs. You can get a quick overview of what’s new and improved in the video above.

Also joining the Taoiseach at the meeting in Dublin were Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Mary Mitchell O’Connor TD, Minister of State for Employment and Small Business, Pat Breen TD, Sheelagh Daly of the Local Enterprise Offices and Martin Corry of Enterprise Ireland. A record 1,842 young entrepreneurs, aged between 18 and 35, have taken part in this year’s IBYE. The competition has progressed through county and regional stages where 24 young entrepreneurs have now emerged as national IBYE finalists and will compete for the prestigious title of Ireland’s Best Young Entrepreneur. The IBYE Final takes place at Google’s European Headquarters in Dublin on Sunday, March 5.  The Taoiseach met the national finalists at Government buildings, before the young entrepreneurs travelled to a pitch training session at Google. He said: “I am overwhelmed and inspired by the entrepreneurial talent that I have encountered here today.  In this fast-moving world, there can be no standing still and we must always stay ahead of the curve in terms of business. It is vital that we nurture our young businesspeople, encourage them, and give them supports as they strive to make an impact and to succeed.”  “We must also be mindful that today’s young entrepreneurs are tomorrow’s employers. IBYE, which is run by the Local Enterprise Offices, is one of the best innovations arising from the Action Plan for Jobs. While there are now nearly 190,000 people more in employment than when the Action Plan for Jobs was first launched in 2012, we must not be complacent. A lot of work still needs to be done to ensure a bright future for everyone in this country. All the young people I met today are Ireland’s future.”  Minister Mary Mitchell O’Connor TD commented: “These young entrepreneurs are shining examples of how Ireland can stand out and succeed in a highly competitive environment. Creativity, design, technology and innovation have been to the fore in this year’s IBYE. I want to congratulate the finalists here today and all who have participated in the competition so far and encourage them to keep going and realise their ambition. I also want to assure young entrepreneurs up and down the country that their Local Enterprise Office will be on hand every step of the way. I wish the finalists every success in the National IBYE final on March 5.”   Minister for Employment and Small Business, Pat Breen, TD, said: “IBYE is one of the most important vehicles we have to help encourage, motivate and kick-start new business in Ireland. The fact that there was a 32 per cent increase in entries in this year’s IBYE competition is a reflection that our young people are eager and hungry to follow their dreams and do it for themselves. Entrepreneurs such as these are a key force in helping to create jobs across every region.”  The IBYE competition is run by Local Enterprise Office Longford. Congratulating the local finalist and highlighting the benefits of the competition for young entrepreneurs, Michael Nevin, Head of Enterprise of the Local Enterprise Office Longford said: “Over the three years of the IBYE competition so far, more than 1,200 young entrepreneurs across the country have benefitted from taking part in IBYE Business Bootcamps and 360 have won investment funding for new or growing businesses. "By taking up the supports on offer through the Local Enterprise Office, we are seeing that even more young entrepreneurs are upskilling; they are developing and refining their plans and business models and they are using financial assistance to unlock new markets and expand their teams” Mr Nevin added: “Looking ahead to the national final of IBYE on March 5, we are very proud to be represented Brian O’Rourke, CitySwifter and we will continue to support them through every step of their journey.” A key motivator and showcase for Ireland’s young entrepreneurial talent, IBYE is run by the 31 Local Enterprise Offices nationwide and supported by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland. The initiative carries a total investment fund of €2 million.

Ah, much better Storage news saved for the end of the week 3 Mar 2017 at 18:02, Chris Mellor TGI (Thank God It’s) Friday and so time to retrieve back burner storage news received in the week and bring it to the fore; Druva says its inSync product is now available on the Google G Suite Marketplace. It says enterprises can deploy Druva inSync directly through the G Suite Marketplace, making it simpler to manage data protection and information governance across endpoints and cloud applications. We’re told Druva is a Google Technology Partner, helping to ensure smooth integration for joint customers. Real-time analytics platform vendor Incorta has completed a $10 million Series A round of financing, led by GV (formerly Google Ventures). Incorta also announced itsDirect Data Mapping Engine which, rather than the traditional model of performing expensive and slow joins to combine data from different data sets, maps directly from each piece of data to all its related data thereby removing the need for costly join operations. This, Incorta says, this reduces query times from hours to seconds to enable real-time analysis, even at massive scale. Micron consumer products business Lexar has a 256GB Professional 1000x microSD UHS-II (U3) card.It has a read transfer speed up to 150MB/sec (1000x)1, a write speed of up to 90MB/sec, and includes a microSD UHS-II USB 3.0 reader for high-speed file transfer. It is designed for sports camcorders, tablets, and smartphones and is ‘Works with GoPro’ verified for compatibility with GoPro cameras. Lexar says the new card capacity will be available in Q1 of 2017 with an MSRP of $349.99 (£357.99). The Lexar Professional 1000x microSDXC/microSDHC™ cards are also available in the following capacities: 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB. To offer an even broader range of affordable performance options, the 256GB capacity High-Performance 633x microSDXC UHS-I card will move to UHS Speed Class 1 (U1) in Q1 of 2017 with an MSRP of $279.99 (£286.99). Hyper-converged appliance and storage array vendor Pivot3 has appointed Mark Maisano joining as vice president of channel sales. He joins Pivot3 from Acronis, and Ingram Micro and Seagate Technology before that, and will focus on building strategic partnerships and driving channels sales for multiple data-intensive systems in markets like video surveillance, end-user computing and data centre modernisation in the financial services, healthcare, transportation and defence markets. Riverbed’s SteelFusion v5.0 includes new support of Network Attached Storage alongside existing support for SAN and Object-based storage. It has surpassed 1,000 customers for SteelFusion, which is roughly speaking a server and WAN optimisation box in one package. Object storage vendor Scality has issued an “Aren’t we doing well!” release. It says it ended 2016 with 85 per cent year-over-year revenue growth ,with Q4 representing its largest quarter ever. Business booked through alliance partners soared to 76 per cent as the company’s new Scality ATLAS Partner Program was launched. This supports 25 global alliance and channel partners including Cisco, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Scality says it grew its installed base with 40+ new enterprise customers, bringing the total number of million-dollar accounts to 25 and total referenceable customers to 135. New customers came from across the USA, Western Europe, and Japan in the banking and finance, media and entertainment, manufacturing, and industrial design markets, with Scality capturing four of the world’s fifteen largest banks. CEO Jérôme Lecat bullishly exclaimed; “We have primed the engine for an explosive, growth-fueled new year.” The Storage Performance Council has concluded the development and early use phases of its SPC-1 V3 benchmark, which is a complete refresh of the SPC benchmark technology. Going forward, all SPC-1 benchmark results will be produced using SPC-1 V3. John Stephens, SPC Administrator, said; “The SPC-1 V3 benchmark is designed from the ground up for scalability and extreme I/O throughputs. SPC-1’s highly realistic data generation model is a dramatic advancement over the synthetic data generation models available in first generation compression and deduplication-aware load generators. It will reflect the realistic gains in space efficiency expected to occur in production environments when using compression and/or deduplication technology.” Huawei Technologies Storage Product Line president Meng Guangbin, said; “SPC-1 v3, with its audited and peer-reviewed results, gives Huawei the opportunity to compare our products with others on a level playing field based on objective metrics that reflect production conditions.” Another supportive vendor is IBM. Alistair Symon, VP for XIV and Storage Development at IBM, said; “As one of the founding members of the SPC, IBM was proud to sponsor the first SPC-1 V3 result and will continue to rely on it to showcase the real-life performance advantages of our storage products.” Backup software phenomenon Veeam has launched direct snapshot integration of the Veeam Availability Suite with the Cisco HyperFlex hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) platform. It says users will get; Improved Recovery Point Objectives – Using Backups from Storage Snapshots enables the user to run a backup at any time and any frequency, reducing a business’ exposure to data loss. Minimised Impact on Production – Not using VMware VM snapshots means the high impact of snapshot create and delete operations are eliminated. This dramatically reduces the performance impact on production VMs during the copy process. Accelerated Backups – Potentially improves copy speed up to twice as much compared to the standard as the standard VMware vSphere APIs, through the unique ability to backup data directly from the file system with asynchronous reads when using Veeam Availability Suite 9.5. Agentless Application Aware Backup – Across multiple applications, such as Microsoft Active Directory, Exchange, SharePoint, SQL Server and Oracle. Storage Replication – Customers can now replicate Cisco HyperFlex workloads to another HyperFlex System or to any other VMware vSphere environment including Veeam Cloud and Service Providers by using Veeam’s VM Replication functionality. Veritas Technologies has a partnership with Fujitsu to sell Veritas NetBackup Appliances. Fujitsu is one of Veritas’ largest Global Strategic Partners. Veritas NetBackup Appliances will be offered alongside the existing Fujitsu ETERNUS range of hardware, and this availability of NetBackup alongside Fujitsu’s ETERNUS hardware range strengthens their alliance. Two appliances are mentioned; NetBackup 5240: A versatile, cost-optimised, integrated backup appliance that can be deployed as a master server, media server or both. NetBackup 5330: A performance-optimised, integrated backup media server with high-density storage to support greater performance, capacity and resiliency in the enterprise.

Enter Amazon’s Echo, a voice-driven computer that answers to the name of Alexa, which can recite life-saving instructions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a skill taught to it by the American Heart Association. Alexa is accumulating other health-care skills, too, including acting as a companion for the elderly and answering questions about children’s illnesses. In the near future she will probably help doctors with grubby hands to take notes and to request scans, as well as remind patients to take their pills. Alexa is one manifestation of a drive to disrupt an industry that has so far largely failed to deliver on the potential of digital information. Health care is over-regulated and expensive to innovate in, and has a history of failing to implement ambitious IT projects. But the momentum towards a digital future is gathering pace. Investment into digital health care has soared (see chart). One reason for that is the scale of potential cost-savings. Last year Americans spent an amount equivalent to about 18% of GDP on health care. That is an extreme, but other countries face rising cost pressures from health spending as populations age. Much of this expenditure is inefficient. Spending on administration varies sevenfold between rich countries. There are huge differences in the cost of medical procedures. In rich countries about one-fifth of spending on health care goes to waste, for example on wrong or unnecessary treatments. Eliminating a fraction of this sum is a huge opportunity. Consumers seem readier to accept digital products than just a few years ago. The field includes mobile apps, telemedicine—health care provided using electronic communications—and predictive analytics (using statistical methods to sift data on outcomes for patients). Other areas are automated diagnoses and wearable sensors to measure things like blood pressure. If there is to be a health-care revolution, it will create winners and losers. Andy Richards, an investor in digital health, argues that three groups are fighting a war for control of the “health-care value chain”. One group comprises “traditional innovators”—pharmaceutical firms, hospitals and medical-technology companies such as GE Healthcare, Siemens, Medtronic and Philips. A second category is made up of “incumbent players”, which include health insurers, pharmacy-benefit managers (which buy drugs in bulk), and as single-payer health-care systems such as Britain’s NHS. The third group are the technology “insurgents”, including Google, Apple, Amazon and a host of hungry entrepreneurs that are creating apps, predictive-diagnostics systems and new devices. These firms may well profit most handsomely from the shift to digital. The threat to the traditional innovators is that as medical records are digitised and new kinds of patient data arrive from genomic sequencing, sensors and even from social media, insurers and governments can get much better insight into which treatments work. These buyers are increasingly demanding “value-based” reimbursement—meaning that if a drug or device doesn’t function well, it will not be bought. The big question is whether drug companies will be big losers, says Marc Sluijs, an adviser on investment in digital health. More data will not only identify those drugs that do not work. Digital health care will also give rise to new services that might involve taking no drugs at all. Lunches eaten Diabetes is an obvious problem for the pharma business in this regard, says Dan Mahony, a partner at Polar Capital, an investment firm. Since evidence shows that exercise gives diabetics better control of their disease (and helps most pre-diabetics not to get sick at all), there is an opening for new services. UnitedHealthcare, a big American insurer, for example, has a prevention programme that connects pre-diabetics with special coaches at gyms. An app or a wearable device that persuades people to walk a certain distance every day would be far cheaper for insurers and governments to provide than years of visits to doctors, hospitals and drugs. Although Fitbits are frequently derided for ending up in the back of a drawer, people can be motivated to get off the sofa. Players of Pokémon Go have collectively walked nearly 9bn kilometres since the smartphone game was released last year. That is the backdrop to a new firm called Onduo, a joint venture that Google’s health-care venture, Verily Life Sciences, and Sanofi, a French drug firm, set up last year. Onduo will start by developing ways to help diabetics make better decisions about their use of drugs and their lifestyle habits. Later on, Onduo wants to help those who are at risk of diabetes not to develop it. The startup is a good hedge for Sanofi, which faces a slowdown in sales of its blockbuster insulin medication, Lantus, which lost patent protection in 2015. This kind of thinking does not come easily to drug firms. Switzerland’s Novartis is one of the few to have acknowledged that digital innovation will mean selling products based on patient outcomes. But if pharma firms do not design solutions that put the patient, rather than drug sales, at the centre of their strategy, they risk losing relevance, says Mr Sluijs. Large hospitals, some of which count as both incumbents and traditional innovators, will also be affected. The rise of telemedicine, predictive analytics and earlier diagnoses of illnesses are expected to reduce admissions, particularly of the emergency kind that are most lucrative in commercial systems. The sickest patients can be targeted by specialist services, such as Evolution Health, a firm in Texas that cares for 2m of the most-ill patients across 15 states. It claims to be able to reduce the use of emergency rooms by a fifth, and inpatient stays in hospitals by two-fifths. Rapid medical and diagnostic innovation will disrupt all businesses that rely heavily on physical facilities and staff. A mobile ultrasound scanner made by Philips, called Lumify, means that a far larger number of patients can be seen by their own doctors. As for data-based diagnostics, one potential example of its power to change business models is Guardant Health, a startup that is analysing large quantities of medical data in order to develop a way of diagnosing cancer from blood tests. If the firm can devise an early test for breast cancer, demand for mammograms and the machines that take them would fall, along with the need for expensive drugs and spells in hospital. From ER to AI There is also good news for hospitals, however. Increasingly, machine-learning programs are able to make diagnoses from scans and from test results. An intriguing recent project has been to stream and analyse live health data and deliver alerts on an app that is carried around by doctors and nurses at the Royal Free Hospital in London. The app, which is the work of DeepMind, a British artificial-intelligence (AI) research firm owned by Google, identifies the patients at greatest risk of a sudden and fatal loss of kidney function. The Royal Free says that the app is already saving nurses’ time. Naturally enough, the health-care entrepreneurs have the boldest visions. The point of care will move rapidly into the home, they say. People will monitor their heart conditions, detect concussions, monitor the progress of diseases and check up on moles or ear infections using apps, mobile phones and sensors. Last year the FDA approved 36 connected health apps and devices. A new app, called Natural Cycles, was recently approved in Europe for use as a contraceptive. Its failure rate for typical use was equivalent to that of popular contraceptive pills. A smartphone may eventually be able to predict the onset of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s or even the menopause (if the information is wanted). In emerging economies, where regulations on health data are less onerous and where people often already expect to pay to see a doctor, there is faster growth and innovation. China, which is building 400 hospitals a year, saw its two largest VC investments in digital health care last year. One went into a Chinese medical-service app, Ping An Good Doctor, which raised $500m; a video-consultations app called Chunyu Yisheng raised $183m. India is another innovator. To take one example, LiveHealth, based in Pune, is an app that lets patients assemble all their health records in one place, see test results and communicate with doctors. In the short term, the greatest disruption will come from a growing array of apps in many countries around the world that give consumers direct access to qualified GPS on their mobile phones. Overall, telemedicine is expected to grow rapidly. In America, GPs will conduct 5.4m video consultations a year by 2020, says IHS Markit, a research firm. Britain’s NHS is testing a medical AI from a London-based startup called Babylon which can field patients’ questions about their health. A paid service called Push Doctor offers an online appointment almost immediately for £20 ($24). The firm maximises the efficiency of its doctors by reducing the time they spend on administrative duties. They spend 93% of their time with patients compared with only 61% in Britain’s public sector. Babylon reckons that 85% of consultations do not need to be in person. In the longer term, the biggest upheaval may come from the large technology firms. Amazon and Google are not the only giants to be stalking health care. Apple has expressed a strong interest in it, though it is taking time to decide exactly what it wants to do. For several years it has provided a way of bringing together health data on its iPhone, and tools for health researchers to build apps. As personal-health records accumulate on its platform, from sensors such as Fitbits to medical-grade devices, it will encourage more app development. An app using data from an iPhone or another smartphone might be able to warn users that a sedentary lifestyle will exacerbate a heart condition or that, based on social-media patterns, they are at risk of depression, for example. Apple and other tech firms may also be able to help patients take greater control of their existing health records. For now medical records mostly remain under the guard of those who provided the care, but this is expected to change. If patients do gain proper access to their own data, Apple is in a particularly strong position. Its platform is locked and fairly secure, and the apps that run on it are all screened by the firm. None of this will materialise quickly. Regulated health-care systems will take time to deal with concerns over accuracy, security and privacy. In Britain the Royal Free is already under scrutiny over how it shared its patients’ data. That suggests a broader worry: that technology companies are too cavalier with their users’ data. Such firms typically use long agreements on data rights that are hard for individuals to understand. The medical world places importance on informed consent, so a clash of cultures seems unavoidable. Yet enormous change looks inevitable. Investors hope for billion-dollar health-tech “unicorns”. Payers eye equally sizeable savings. Amid such talk it is worth remembering that the biggest winners from digital health care will be the patients who receive better treatment, and those who avoid becoming patients at all.

"There is an annual rhythm in the industry,” Osterloh said. “So, you can count on us to follow it.” Google’s hardware head wouldn’t give a more specific timetable for the new Pixel beyond sometime this year. "You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now,” he said. While we had expected that Google would be continuing the Pixel line, this is the first official confirmation that we’ll be seeing a new model this year. As for the phone’s price, it doesn’t seem that Google has any plans to make a budget version. Per Osterloh: "Pixel stays premium.” Of course, launching a new Pixel phone is all well and good. But hopefully in addition to developing its next major smartphone, Google’s also working on figuring out how to actually ship the current generation of Pixels it already sells.

Now, when users select a filter, the Google Photos app will correct the white balance in an image in addition to the exposure and saturation. Users can tweak things further by going into "Color" and adjusting the warmth and tint.  SEE ALSO: Google Pixel 2 might make you ditch your real camera once and for all Simply put, white balance is a tool used to render colors correctly. Sometimes due to lighting, photos can turn out too yellow, as in the example bellow, or eerily blue. Auto white balance is a staple feature of most cameras and photo-editing tools, and it helps your pictures look better and more natural.  Before Auto White Balance Image: google After Auto White Balance Image: Google Google has been steadily added useful updates to Google Photos since its launch a couple years ago—most recently integrating smart albums and a tool called PhotoScan to digitize old Photos.  The product's main draw is its incredible search feature, which allows users to look for images not only by basic criteria like date and time but also using advanced filters like faces of specific people and simple objects or settings, like "beach" or "watermelon."  Photos is one of Google's best products in recent memory. The company has used its years of research in search, image recognition and machine learning to make a product that is Google at its best—simple and reliable. Auto white balance is rolling out this week to the Android and web apps and will be coming to iOS soon.  BONUS: Our picks for the top 10 best film performances in cinema history   Topics: Google, Google Photos, Photography, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

On Monday, Musk announced that his space exploration company, SpaceX, had agreed to the trip for 'two private citizens', scheduled for the end of 2018.  The trip will send the passengers around the moon's orbit and propel them back to Earth, but won't land on the moon. The voyaging vessel, SpaceX's Dragon 2, will be remote controlled, but the tourists will undergo emergency situation training. 'They have already paid a significant deposit to do a moon mission. Like the Apollo astronauts before them, these individuals will travel into space carrying the hopes and dreams of all humankind, driven by the universal human spirit of exploration,' the tech mogul said.  On Monday, tech mogul Elon Musk (above) announced that his space exploration company, SpaceX, had agreed to send two 'private citizens' to the moon, scheduled for the end of 2018 The travellers for now remain anonymous but Musk said he would release their names at a later date.

The voyaging vessel, SpaceX's Dragon 2, will be remote controlled and the tourists will undergo emergency training. Above, a SpaceX processing building at the Kennedy Space Center 'This presents an opportunity for humans to return to deep space for the first time in 45 years and they will travel faster and further into the Solar System than any before them.' The travelers for now remain anonymous; Musk said he would release their names at a later date if they approved. DailyMail.com has spoken with aerospace experts and space veterans and assembled a list of space enthusiasts who have the passion – and the considerable passage, estimated by one expert in the region of $100 million – to make the cut. Dennis Tito, the pioneer of space tourism who was the first private citizen to fund his own trip, shared a glimpse of what SpaceX passengers can expect. He told DailyMail.com: 'I wanted to fly in space since the early 60s and set a goal that I would eventually do it. Finally I had the opportunity 40 years later but it was well worth waiting for because it was just euphoric and the best eight days I've ever spent in my entire life.' Tito ruled himself out as a SpaceX passenger.  Two-time private astronaut and tech billionaire, Charles Simonyi, told DailyMail.com that he 'had some suspicions' on potential passengers and said that Musk had set himself 'an incredibly audacious goal.' 'I have the greatest respect for his talent and for audacity in general. I really wish him the best success in what he's doing,' Simonyi said. Adventurer Per Wimmer, who is signed up for three upcoming trips to space including on Virgin Galactic - but not SpaceX - said SpaceX's program and 2018 launch date was 'ambitious'. 'When it comes to space, it always takes longer and costs more than you initially think,' he told DailyMail.com Wimmer said he was sure that Musk, who he knows personally, would achieve the goal due to his reputation in 'disruptive technology' and the huge amount of capital he has raised to innovate the aerospace industry. 'I'm sure Elon will execute the mission, if not exactly within the timescale but I wish him all the best,' he said. 'He's got the vision, he works incredibly hard and he surrounds himself with clever people who can do clever things.' MOON SHOT: LIKELY SUSPECTS  The female space veteran: Anousheh Ansari The engineer and entrepreneur was the fourth self-funded explorer to visit space in 2006 - her ticket cost $20 million-plus.  Iranian-American Ansari, 50, and her family sponsor an X Prize – a $10 million reward for the first commercial company to launch a reusable manned spacecraft into space twice in two weeks.  Engineer and entrepreneur Anousheh Ansari was the fourth self-funded explorer to visit space in 2006. On Sunday, Ansari accepted the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film on behalf of Iranian director, Asghar Farhadi, who boycotted the ceremony She previously told Forbes: 'As a successful entrepreneur, it would have been easy for me to stay safely in my comfort zone rather than putting my reputation on the line by venturing into the risky business of space travel. However, I believe that taking risks are at the core of achieving a big dream or anything of significance, so this was no different in my mind.' On Sunday, Ansari accepted the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for 'The Salesman' on behalf of Iranian director, Asghar Farhadi, who boycotted the ceremony over President Trump's travel ban. Incidentally, Elon Musk also attended Sunday's Academy Awards. She did not respond to a request for comment by DailyMail.com. The young tech mogul: Mark Shuttleworth Mark Shuttleworth is South African-born and made his Internet millions at a young age. He became the second space tourist in 2002 in his late twenties and paid around $20 million Like Musk, 43-year-old Shuttleworth is South African-born and made his Internet millions at a young age.  Shuttleworth founded Thawte Consulting in 1995, a company which specializes in digital certificates and Internet security. In December 1999, Thawte was acquired by VeriSign, earning Shuttleworth about $575 million.  He became the second space tourist in 2002 in his late twenties (he paid around $20m) and during the voyage spoke to Nelson Mandela.  He did not respond when asked via email if he would take part in the SpaceX mission.   The 'rocket man': Steve Jurvetson Steve Jurvetson, 49, is a renowned venture capitalist who has invested widely in the space industry. He is on the board of SpaceX and Planet Labs, which builds satellites A renowned venture capitalist, the 49-year-old has invested widely in the space industry.  He is on the board of SpaceX and Planet Labs, which builds satellites.  Jurvetson celebrated SpaceX's announcement on Monday by tweeting a picture of the company's spacecraft, the Dragon, with the message: 'How to train your Dragon 2. Dream BIG.' Being a pioneer is not new to him – he was the first person in the world to own a Tesla electric car. He did not respond to a request for comment. The dreamer: Naveen Jain Naveen Jain, 57, is a space fanatic and founded Moon Express, which aims to become the first moon mining company to extract precious resources for use on Eart The internet entrepreneur, 57, is a space fanatic and founded Moon Express, which wants to become the first moon mining company to extract precious resources for use on Earth. Last year he told CNBC: 'If you want to make an impact, you have to dream big, even if people think you're crazy. As an entrepreneur, you never fail; you pivot. If you are shooting for the moon, you probably can actually land on it and solve problems.' The night before Musk's big announcement, Jain tweeted a picture of spaceman floating over the earth with one of his own motivational quotes: 'Walk away from people who laugh at your ambitions.' He added: 'Nothing is more destructive to success than limiting beliefs. #mondaymotivation'. Jain did not respond to DailyMail.com. The space visionary: Peter Diamandis Peter Diamandis, 55, is a Bronx-born doctor and entrepreneur who has been educating people on space since he learned of the Apollo missions as a young boy. He is a co-founder and leader of a number of space innovators The Bronx-born doctor and entrepreneur, 55, has been educating people on space since he learned of the Apollo missions as a young boy and has long dreamed of becoming an astronaut. For years, he has been at the forefront of space exploration and discovery. He founded the X Prize Foundation – a non-profit which has the grand goal of giving multi-million-dollar rewards to breakthroughs that 'pushes the limits of what's possible — to change the world for the better'. He is a co-founder and leader of a number of space innovators including Space Adventures, the Rocket Racing League, Planetary Resources and the International Space University. He also wants to help humans live to 150 years old with his company, Human Longevity. Diamandis did not respond to request for comment. The 'enlightened' competitor for richest man on earth: Google's Sergey Brin Google's Sergey Brin is estimated to be one of the world's richest people with $40 billion wealth. In 2008, he invested $5m in Space Adventures as a deposit for future flights on the Soyuz space shuttle, which had carried previous space tourists From a young age, Brin knew of space travel: his mother worked as a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Brin, now 43, entered Silicon Valley folklore after founding Google in a garage in his mid-twenties with college friend Larry Page.  He is estimated to be one of the world's richest people with $40 billion wealth. He was once called 'Enlightenment Man' by The Economist because of his belief that 'knowledge is always good'. In 2008, he invested $5m in Space Adventures as a deposit for future flights on the Soyuz space shuttle, which had carried previous space tourists. At the time, he told the New York Times: 'I am a big believer in the exploration and commercial development of the space frontier, and am looking forward to the possibility of going into space.' The Soyuz trips were postponed before Brin had a chance to go. Google did not respond to comment. The risk-taking director: James Cameron Director James Cameron, 62, has set tongues wagging in the space community as a possible moon voyager due to his other challenging explorations Although Musk ruled out Hollywood, James Cameron has set tongues wagging in the space community as a possible moon voyager due to his other challenging explorations – including reaching the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean in Deepsea Challenger five years ago. (He is the first person to do it solo and only the third in history.) The Canadian billionaire, 62, has long expressed a fascination with space – both in his movies and with real-life projects. He sits on the advisory board of Planetary Resources, a company which plans to mine asteroids for precious minerals, where investors include Virgin's Richard Branson, Alphabet's Eric Schmidt and Larry Page, and Microsoft alum Charles Simonyi. A rep for Cameron responded to a DailyMail.com interview request: 'Thank you but he isn't available to participate.' The founder: Elon Musk himself Although the 45-year-old billionaire said in a prepared statement that two private citizens had approached him about the mission, it hasn't stopped fans breathlessly speculating it could be Musk himself. Musk, who has recently met with President Trump a number of times, shares a similar vision to the president in terms of commercial partnership with public agencies, such as NASA. DailyMail.com reached out to SpaceX for comment. Staying grounded (for now, at least).  These space enthusiasts have confirmed to DailyMail.com that they won't be on the SpaceX flight The pioneer: Dennis Tito Dennis Tito is a wealthy American engineer and entrepreneur who was the first citizen to fund his own trip into space. The wealthy American engineer and entrepreneur was the first citizen to fund his own trip into space.  He spent almost eight days on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft in 2001, paying an estimated $20 million and using the time to perform scientific experiments. Now 76, Tito told DailyMail.com he was not one of the SpaceX two – and said he had no insider knowledge on who it could be, adding it would 'require someone of means and with a real interest in space'. He said: 'I think it would be a wonderful experience. I'm really excited to hear that this is going to take place in the near future.' The frequent-flier: Tech billionaire Charles Simonyi Charles Simonyi, an early pioneer at Microsoft with Bill Gates who is credited with its Office program, has been to space not once - but twice. Dr. Charles Simonyi, an early pioneer at Microsoft with Bill Gates who is credited with its Office program, has been to space not once - twice - but says he is 'done with space tourism' Each trip was two weeks long - with two days on the Russian spacecraft, Soyuz, and the rest of the time on the International Space Station (ISS). He made the trips in 2007 and 2009, spending an estimated $25m and $35m respectively. 'I went up on one spacecraft with one crew and came down on a different spacecraft with a different crew. So altogether I've been flying with ten different astronauts on five different spacecrafts,' Simonyi said. The 68-year-old software architect said he was not one of the SpaceX passengers. 'No – I'm done with space tourism,' he told DailyMail.com. 'I have to work and I have two small kids to spend time with.' The invested adventurer: Per Wimmer Per Wimmer ruled himself out of the SpaceX trip but told DailyMail.com that he 'wished' he was going. Financier and philanthropist Per Wimmer, a friend of Elon Musk, ruled himself out of the SpaceX trip but told DailyMail.com that he 'wished' he was going The financier and philanthropist, who is a friend of Elon Musk, bought his first ticket to space 17 years ago.  Wimmer, 49, has completed the rigorous training program and is already signed up for three trips: he is a founding astronaut with Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic; astronaut 'Number 1' for the XCOR Lynx space craft and holds a seat with Space Adventures. He told DailyMail.com: 'I'm a serial committer in that regard but it's not me on this occasion.' He estimated that a seat on the Dragon 2 spacecraft would cost about $100 million. Wimmer said although he did not know who the two private passengers were it would likely be revealed on the 'space grapevine'.  'It's a very small market but I think two people have called Elon – I don't think he was in the market of selling around the moon trips. 'I think he's very busy with cargo trips to the ISS and the manned flights. I don't think everything has been fleshed out yet.' Wimmer said he hoped to make it to space in around 18 months. 'I am one of the first ones to go on the Galactic and that program is moving forward very nicely. I am the number one astronaut on XCOR and I don't think that call is a million miles away. I'll probably fly on Galactic before the round-the-moon trip happens.' He added: 'Not that there's any competition, we're all friends in the space business.' The second generation astronaut: Richard Garriott Video game developer Richard Garriott was the sixth space tourist in 2008, paying an estimated $30 million for the privilege. Video game developer Garriott was the sixth space tourist in 2008, paying an estimated $30 million for the privilege. Along with being credited with creating the term 'avatar', he is also behind a number of blockbuster games including fantasy role-playing game, Ultima Series.  A founding member of Space Adventures, Garriott's father was a NASA astronaut (making him the only second-generation astronaut). However Garriott ruled himself out, tweeting hours after the Space X announcement: 'Not me... yet!' Hollywood Stars During a teleconference on Monday, Elon Musk ruled out any celebrities, saying curtly: 'It's no one from Hollywood.' Among the celebrities who hold $250,000 tickets on Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic are Leonardo DiCaprio, Ashton Kutcher, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks and Lady Gaga.

Elon Musk did not divulge the cost of a seat on the private SpaceX moon trip but said his company had accepted a 'significant deposit'. Private astronaut Per Wimmer, who has two decades of experience in the space industry, told DailyMail.com: 'I think it will be not far from $100 million – knowing what it takes rocket-wise, the trajectory and also building in a profit margin.' A ride on the Soyuz spacecraft – as far as the ISS, 250 miles above earth – costs upwards of $70 million. 'To go around the moon and back is about 300,000-400,000 miles but it doesn't cost much more because once you're out of the earth's atmosphere, you don't need a lot of energy to keep going. That first 1km is the most expensive,' said Wimmer. ARE THERE HEALTH RISKS? Musk said on Monday that he expected health and fitness tests for the moon trip to begin in late 2017. Wimmer explained the two aspects of space travel which take the greatest toll on the body. 'It's recommended to get your body used to G-force exposure and the weightless environment. 'When you launch, it's a minimum G-force of X - the equivalent of lying down and having six people standing on top of you. When you put yourself in a weightless environment – it's very strange on your balance and can play tricks on your mind.' He said that doctors can mitigate for a lot of minor health problems but there were like to be two major health concerns that would prevent you from going into space. Private astronaut Per Wimmer, who has two decades of experience in the space industry, told DailyMail.com: 'I think it [the SpaceX moon trip] will be not far from $100 million – knowing what it takes rocket-wise, the trajectory and also building in a profit margin'. Above, Wimmer shows his ticket for space traveling after a press conference in California in 2008 'You get a lot of G-Force pressure to your back, so if you have a problem there, that's tricky,' he said. 'Because of the pressure, adrenaline and all the excitement, if you have a weak heart or a heart condition, I wouldn't recommend it. It's a lot of strain on the body.' He added: 'They have got to make sure your body is in good condition and there's no big hiccups that can happen. So a rigorous medical is also important. 'You also do normal exercise, eat well and don't drink. There's not many things that can rule you out as long as you listen to the doctor and complete your training. WHAT TRAINING IS INVOLVED? There are three elements – human centrifuge training, preparation for weightlessness and flying at high altitudes and high speed. CENTRIFUGE - Wimmer explained: 'You go round and round in circles, creating G-Force exposure to the body. It completely simulates a rocket launch. It's not for people who are claustrophobic but it's very useful. THE 'VOMIT COMET' - Trainee astronauts are flown in a jumbo jet to an altitude of 14km - then the plane makes more than a dozen 'passes' – accelerating towards the ground – to reach a low altitude. This technique creates 30-40 seconds of weightlessness. When the plane reaches 6km, the pilot goes back up again. 'During a training session, they do about 16 passes and have 15 people on board. There's always a few throwing up in the corner,' Wimmer said. FIGHTER JET TRAINING - Fighter jets fly at Mach 3, three times the speed of sound. They reach altitudes of 80,000ft at which point you can see the curvature of the earth. Wimmer said: 'We fly fast and high but also a bit lower to do acrobatics, which exposes your body to G-Force. Its excellent training as it teaches you how to react and your body's limits in terms of pressure.' HOW LONG DOES TRAINING TAKE? It's dependent on the type of flight. Wimmer said: 'For suborbital flights training usually takes one or two weeks because it's a relatively short flight - you're up and back in the same day. 'When it comes to around the moon, it gets a little more complex. The best example would be the Soviets' program. They typically spend four months in Star City (the Cosmonaut training center in Moscow). RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Touchdown! The incredible moment Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket...

Elon will probably condense it down to what really matters and make a fairly efficient program. Two-time private astronaut, Charles Simonyi, also shared the knowledge of his training for space. He told DailyMail.com: 'I trained for eight months for the first flight. I only had to do three months [for the second flight] because they accepted the results of the first training. The Soyuz is a very old-fashioned spacecraft and it's really not built for ease of use. I'm sure that the amount of training for the Dragon will be much less. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO GO INTO SPACE? The first ever self-funded space tourist, Dennis Tito, told DailyMail.com that his experience in space made him feel 'euphoric'. He added: 'I expect that the two individuals who will fly to the moon, or the vicinity of the moon, will have also a glorious experience and I would think an even greater experience because of being so far from earth.' Simonyi said he had been more deeply affected by the training program than the flight. The first ever self-funded space tourist, Dennis Tito, told DailyMail.com that his experience in space made him feel 'euphoric'. Above, Tito in space in 2001 He said: 'The flight was an intellectual exercise - seeing for real what the training made me understand. There were no surprises during the flight because the training was so good, with lots of simulations. I'm also a pilot and the good thing about simulators is you typically practice for emergencies that don't happen on real flights – the same thing with space. In a way, the training gave a greater range of experiences than the flight itself. He added: 'Though we did have few small failures during the flight [to space]. My crewmates and I had a chuckle because one failure was what we practised for on our final exam on the ground.' WHAT DOES SPACE LOOK LIKE? Simonyi said: 'It's an amazing expanse and it's not unlike flying on an aircraft. Obviously you're a little higher but not extremely so. You don't see the whole of the earth from low orbit where the space station is flying. Two-time private astronaut Dr. Charles Simonyi said he had been more deeply affected by the training program than the flight itself. 'The flight was an intellectual exercise - seeing for real what the training made me understand,' he said. Above, Simonyi rests shortly after landing from his space trip in 2009 'The ISS is 250 miles above the surface – the distance between New York and Boston. You see one or two states, a few countries in Europe but not much more than that.' WHAT DO YOU DO IN SPACE? Simonyi said: 'I volunteered for as many experiments as they were willing to trust me with. Many of these experiments are fairly simply but the professional astronauts only have so much time. For the European Space Agency I did a sample experiment, taking biological swabs of various prescribed parts of the space station to see if any bacteria are living there. They were returned to Earth to be analysed. 'Other experiments were as simple as giving blood before and after the flight. Many of the effects of the space are not well understood and the more people fly, the more data the scientists have. 'I did a high resolution cat scan of my leg and arm before and after to research bone loss. What's great is the tourists are not exactly the same kind of people as the professionals – we tend to be older, tend to be less athletic – just normal people.'  Read more: Enlightenment man | The Economist Google Co-Founder Books a Space Flight - The New York Times Share or comment on this article e-mail 25 shares Most watched News videos Leopards attack giant Rock Python in Kruger National Park The Walking Dead: New strain of spice turns homeless into zombies Woman stops car to beat passenger senseless on the road Louis Tomlinson challenges photographer before taking out fan Shocking video shows moment teenager is stabbed in South Norwood Droning on!: Neighbour tries to shoot down spying drone Violent brawl breaks out after man is savagely headbutted to floor Shocking video shows why Coke Zero really is better for you The Manly ferry tackles huge swells over the weekend Dash cam captures close drive-By shooting in Kansas Avalanche crashes down mountain at Russian ski resort Clever dog says 'I love you' to its owner to get treat PIERS MORGAN: Sorry Emma, but you haven’t done yourself...

Previously, users had to hack things or wait for developers to customize their Android app for use on a Chromebook, but Google announced earlier this year that they would put the Google Play Store on ChromeOS. We’ll show users how to install Android apps on Chromebook if their Chromebook supports it. This will include changing from the stable release channel of ChromeOS to the developer’s channel. That means users will start running a ChromeOS version that might include some glitches and bugs. However, it also offers new features not available to most users, like the Google Play Store. If you use your Chromebook for work or school and can’t afford bugs and glitches, then you should wait until Google makes it available on your Chromebook. Google started with the ASUS Chromebook Flip. The Google Chromebook Pixel and Acer Chromebook R11 got it next in mid-July. The rest of most modern Chromebooks made in the last year will eventually get it. If your Chromebook can run build number 53.0.2768.0, the first version that includes the Play Store, then you can follow the steps below to get it early. How do you know if yours will work? Here’s the list of now supported devices that will get the Google Play Store this year. Unfortunately, that list is only for those that can run the Google Play Store in the stable build of ChromeOS. More Chromebooks will let you install Android apps if you run ChromeOS in the beta or developer builds. The list of Chromebooks that support the Google Play Store on developer or beta channels changes quickly. Head over to the Google+ Chromebooks community to find out if your Chromebook will support Android apps. How to Install Android Apps on Chromebook Go to the ChromeOS settings by clicking on the icon in the lower right corner of the screen at the right end of the Shelf. It will look like your Google account avatar. Then click on Settings (see above). At the top of the window that opens up, there’s a link that reads About ChromeOS. Click it. Look for a link in the middle of the box that opens that reads More Info…. The box expands and shows a button that reads Change Channel. Click it and then click on Developer – unstable and then click on the button that appears asking to restart the system. The computer will restart and install the update. When the computer restarts, log in and the Google Play Store will pop up and ask the user to Agree to the user agreement. Click the Agree button and then click on SIGN IN on the next screen. The Google Play Store asks you to accept another agreement. Click on ACCEPT. The Google Play Store now runs on your Chromebook. To install apps find an app you want to install. For example, we’ll install Microsoft Excel. Search for it in the search box. The app will show up in a grid of apps that the search finds. Click on the app’s thumbnail and then click on the INSTALL button. The app will install. Once it’s finished click on OPEN to run it for the first time. Android apps that you install on a Chromebook show up in the  Launcher. Click on the search icon at the left end of the ChromeOS Shelf. You can search for the app title or click on the All Apps box. This opens another box with all the Chrome Web Apps and Android Apps that you’ve installed on the device. Most likely the Android apps will show up on the rightmost screen. Click on the rightmost blue line at the bottom of the box of app icons or use the arrow keys to scroll to the right. If you want quicker access to the Android apps you install on the Chromebook, right-click on an app icon and choose Pin to Shelf in the menu that pops up. How Well Do Android Apps Run on a Chromebook? So far, most of the Android apps I installed on my Chromebook work well. One of my apps is a book viewer and lets me view two different books at a time. The control that opens the split screen view sits in the bottom right corner. The ChromeOS Shelf covers this control and I had to set it to Autohide so that the Shelf would disappear. The Share feature doesn’t work properly in one app. I tapped the Share button and it came up with a Share via… button. Usually, I tap on this button and it gives me a list of apps I can use to share the photo. On the Chromebook, it does nothing since the Share via feature doesn’t work in ChromeOS. Other than these two minor issues, all the ChromeOS apps I’ve installed work well. It opens a new world to Chromebook users.   8 Responses 06/27/2016 T.

Open-source. Suitable for government and other security-conscious offices. The only desktop suite available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Can open and convert almost any legacy document or worksheet. Cons Less stable and not as good-looking suites from Microsoft, Google, and Apple. Online collaboration requires manual installation by an IT expert on a corporate or office-based server. Some dialogs and options are cramped or incomprehensible. Bottom Line LibreOffice is free and open-source, opens almost any legacy document, and is the only office suite available on all major desktop platforms. What it lacks is the smooth interface and stability of its paid competitors. By Edward Mendelson There are lots of reasons to choose the free LibreOffice 5 as your office suite, and plenty of reasons to choose something else, too. The best reason for choosing it is that it's the only fully up-to-date open-source office suite, meaning that security-conscious users like governments and financial institutions—who are typically leery about proprietary office apps from Microsoft, Google, or Apple—can use LibreOffice in full confidence that everything it does is publicly visible, and that none of their data is slipping surreptitiously into some remote database in the name of enhanced productivity. This review focuses mainly on version 5.3 of LibreOffice for Windows, but I also tested it on the Mac, as I'll explain. //Compare Similar Products Compare Microsoft Office 2016 (for Windows)   %displayPrice%%seller% Corel WordPerfect Office X8   %displayPrice%%seller% Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 2016 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 365 Home   %displayPrice%%seller% Pages (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Keynote (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Numbers (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Office Mobile for Office 365 Subscribers (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% LibreOffice (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Google Drive   %displayPrice%%seller% Keynote (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% IBM Lotus Symphony 3.0   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Excel (for iPad)   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft PowerPoint (for iPad)   %displayPrice%%seller% Free and Flexible Other reasons for choosing LibreOffice include that it's free; that it's available with an identical interface and feature set in Windows, macOS, and Linux; and that it's one of the few suites that can open and convert almost any legacy document that you or your office may have created over the last three decades. Another attraction is that LibreOffice still uses the familiar toolbar-and-icon menu structure that millions of users learned from older versions of Microsoft Office, but which Microsoft abandoned ten years ago for the new Ribbon interface. As for the reasons to choose something else, I'll get to those later. Office Work LibreOffice combines a word-processor called Writer, a spreadsheet called Calc, a presentations app called Impress, a vector-drawing program called Draw, a database called Base, and a math-formula editor called Math. The newly released version 5.3 retains the old-school interface of earlier versions, but with more features added to the optional sidebar panel and standard shortcut keys like Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V for cutting and pasting visible on the menu and enabled by default. View All 10 Photos in Gallery A new Safe Mode lets you start LibreOffice with a new user profile, disable extensions, or reset the whole configuration. All this is designed to help you fix the suite when it starts crashing regularly—a problem that, in my experience, is more common in the macOS version than the Windows version. (I haven't been able to fix this problem in macOS, but it's more of a time-wasting annoyance than a data-losing disaster because it usually happens when I try to open a file.) The Writer word-processor finally provides a dialog that lets you jump to a specific page number, supports preset table styles, adds a line-drawing toolbar, and enhances color-selection tools and coordinated color themes that more closely match the stylish ones in Microsoft Office. The Calc spreadsheet acts more like Excel, with wildcards rather than regular expressions as the default setting in formulas, enhanced pivot-table dialogs, and a function-selection menu that narrows down your choices as you type. The Impress presentations app, never a strong point, gets some moderately stylish new templates and a new template-selection dialog when Impress opens up, but don't expect anything like the elegant design and gee-whiz animations that Microsoft gives you with PowerPoint and Apple with Keynote. LibreOffice's main rivals are Microsoft Office, Google Docs, Sheet, and Slides, the corporate G Suite, and Apple's Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, formerly marketed as a suite under the name iWork. All these rivals exist in online versions accessible through a web browser or mobile apps, and all support real-time remote collaboration. Microsoft and Apple's apps exist in both desktop and mobile versions; Google's are only online. Until now, LibreOffice, in its full version, was available only for the desktop. Now, it's also available in a browser-accessible LibreOffice Online version, complete with collaborative editing, but only if your IT department installs it for you. There's no publicly available LibreOffice Online, as there is for Microsoft's, Apple's, and Google's apps. LibreOffice's developers have made slow but steady progress into making the sidebar panel into an easy-to-use alternative to the menus and toolbars, and I'm impressed with the current version's spacious, clean design. The LibreOffice sidebar looks a lot like the sidebar in Apple Keynote, Numbers, and Pages but Apple gets things right that LibreOffice doesn't. For example, Apple's page-layout sidebar lets you enter custom settings for all four page margins. LibreOffice's sidebar only lets you choose among preset margin settings, and you need to open a separate dialog to set custom margins. Once you've set custom margins, the sidebar shows Custom as one of the available margin settings—but if you click on Custom, you don't get back to the dialog where you change the settings. Instead, you have to go back to the separate margin-setting dialog. Apple and Microsoft get this kind of thing right in their desktop suites, but keep in mind that you have to pay for those suites while LibreOffice is free. Legacy File Formats I mentioned LibreOffice's compatibility with legacy file formats. This is a major feature for anyone who may have to work with files created decades ago in obsolete word processors or spreadsheets, and LibreOffice far outclasses Microsoft, Google and Apple in this arena. Its closest rival is the Windows-only Corel WordPerfect Office suite, which also opens almost any legacy document, but, oddly, can't open documents created by the last, unofficial release of WordPerfect for the Mac, while LibreOffice can. If you work in a school, office, or lab with legacy documents, LibreOffice is an essential tool even if you don't use it for everyday work. Clunky and Crashy As for reasons to choose something other than LibreOffice, these may be decisive for you as they are for me. First of all, despite improvements, it's clunky to look at and crashes more than it should. You can easily change its ugly default font, the open-source Liberation Serif font, but until you do, no one will be impressed by your documents. The most commonly used menus are clear and spacious, especially the ones in the sidebar pane, but the Options menu is cramped and often incomprehensible unless you've been using LibreOffice for years. Next, until someone funds a publicly accessible version of LibreOffice online—and that's not likely to happen—you can't work with LibreOffice remotely in the way you can with Microsoft, Apple, and Google. Another problem is that some features simply don't work—or at least don't work reliably enough to rely on. The Mac version of LibreOffice typically crashes a few seconds after I import any Word document, though the same documents cause no problems when I import them in LibreOffice's Windows version. On both the Mac and Windows versions, I wasted a lot of time trying to use an option to access "remote files" on Google Drive or OneDrive, but every effort to log in to those drives produced an obscure error message saying "The specified device is invalid." I eventually discovered that I had encountered a known bug that's been left unfixed for a year. This isn't how professional-quality software is supposed to work. When I edit documents in Microsoft Word in Window (or via Word in Office on the Mac), I turn on the feature that hides the top and bottom margins of the page, so that when I type a sentence that begins on one page and ends on another, I don't have to look at two inches of blank space where the page break occurs. LibreOffice has nothing like this, offering only a Web View that doesn't show any page formatting at all. This hide-blank-space feature may not matter to you, but once you get accustomed to it, there's no going back. A Good Backup Suite LibreOffice is an impressive achievement that keeps getting better with its frequent incremental releases, and anyone who has legacy documents lurking on a hard disk ought to have a copy. But unless you have security requirements that demand open-source software, or your organization needs apps that work on Linux as well as on Windows and the Mac, you're likely going to prefer to pay for Microsoft Office or use Apple's or Google's apps instead.

Name: Subject: Message: Google announces new HP Chromebook in blog post about Swedish schools Newsby Scott Adam Gordon4 days ago 5 385 6   Google published a story on its blog yesterday about the role of technology in education; specifically about how Chromebooks are being used in Swedish schools. Buried among the information was news of a new HP Chromebook (and a new contender for worst-named technology product ever): the Chromebook x360 11 G1 Education Edition, built with the classroom in mind. It’s described as a “rugged” 360-degree convertible Chromebook with USB Type-C charging, world-facing camera capabilities and an optional stylus, in keeping with Google’s new generation of Chromebooks. A world-facing camera allows students to capture photos and videos from all directions. Google says these are being positioned near Chromebook keyboards so that, when a Chromebook is flipped, the camera faces outwards and students can hold it like a tablet. See also: Google Pixel 2 confirmed for later this year and it’s staying “premium” 1 day ago The stylus, meanwhile, would likely be one of the low-cost pens Google has described previously. These resemble “#2 pencils with a unique eraser for correcting mistakes and don’t need charging or pairing, so they can be shared and easily replaced if lost.” Chromebooks are a popular choice for classrooms and students because they’re comparatively inexpensive and have a lightweight UI. Commenting on their prevalence, Google said: “Worldwide more than 20 million teachers and students are using Chromebooks and Google Classroom, and more than 70 million are using G Suite for Education.” The Chromebook x360 11 G1 Education Edition will be available from mid-April but price and availability details are yet to be confirmed.

Simple site- and user-management features. Works the same way on all current desktop and mobile platforms. Fine-tuned collaboration and revision-tracking features. Cons No desktop apps. Offline editing is only possible in the Chrome browser and requires downloading files in advance. Less powerful than desktop-based apps. Bottom Line G Suite offers most of the power and flexibility of its main office-suite rival, Microsoft Office 365. Its entirely cloud-based tools can be used from any desktop or mobile platform, but they lack the full power of desktop apps. By Edward Mendelson Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides is Google's free-for-everyone online office suite, and it excels at helping users create and share documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. If you're sharing a small number of documents with only a few colleagues, the free version of this suite is enough. But for corporate, educational, or any other organized, collective operation, you'll want the paid (starting at $5 per user per month) subscription-based versions that Google offers under the name G Suite. //Compare Similar Products Compare Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 365 Home   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 2016 (for Windows)   %displayPrice%%seller% LibreOffice 5   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Office 2016 (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Corel WordPerfect Office X8   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple Pages (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple Numbers (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple Keynote (for Mac)   %displayPrice%%seller% G Suite's Competition G Suite has powerful rivals, including various corporate-level versions of Microsoft Office 365; Apple's set of iCloud-accessible apps, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote (which used to be sold as a suite called iWork); and online collaboration services like Zoho. Even when compared with these productivity titans, G Suite has plenty of advantages, and it gets new and improved features every few weeks. It has limits too, however, as I'll explain, so you need to make sure it strikes the right balance for your needs before committing to it. Getting Started With G Suite I set up a G Suite account through a simple wizard that required me to choose a domain name, either one I already owned, or a new domain that I could create by paying a $12 annual registration fee. I created a new domain, PCMagReviewers.com, and then created e-mail accounts at that address for myself and some colleagues. The setup screen let me send out messages to my colleagues' existing addresses notifying them of the new addresses I had created for them. After that, I signed in at google.com using my new e-mail address, and a menu at the upper right of the window let me access all the G Suite apps. View All 10 Photos in Gallery G Suite offers three versions: Basic, Business, and Enterprise. All include the Google apps and calendar, video and voice conferencing, and management features. The Basic service costs $5 per user per month and gives you a total of 30 GB of cloud storage, shared among users. The Business version costs $10 per user per month and offers unlimited storage, plus archiving, auditing and data-retention features for corporate compliance, and electronic discovery for use when gathering legal evidence. Enterprise plans are priced individually and add advanced security, data-retention, and data-analysis features. Note that business subscriptions to Office 365 also start at $5 per user per month. G Suite's management menus are clear and straightforward, but Microsoft's equivalent menus in corporate versions of Office 365 seem to me easier to navigate and visually more elegant. Apple doesn't offer a corporate-level service comparable to G Suite or Office 365, though the $19.95 macOS Server add-on to macOS provides features for sharing files, calendars, contacts, and mail accounts. G Suite Administration I've been using an enterprise version of G Suite for years through a large organization that I work for, but, for this review, I tested G Suite's Basic service to get an idea of what it's like to administer the suite instead of merely using the setup that an administrator created for me. As in corporate-level versions of Office 365 and Zoho Docs, I used a site-creating wizard to build a website for my new domain, and make it accessible either only to users with addresses at PCMagReviewers.com or to anyone on the web. The Google Sites app that creates these sites has all the elegance and simplicity of Google's other apps, making it effortless to build a multipage site in less than an hour. Google Sites is free for anyone to use, but free users can only create sites with a sites.google.com address, while G Suite subscribers use their own domain name as their site address, just as in any other paid web-hosting service. Office Suite Functionality G Suite's versions of Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides offer the same elegant, minimalist-looking templates that you get in the free versions, but G Suite lets you upload your own documents, spreadsheets, or presentations to use as templates for creating new ones. For collaboration and sharing, G Suite offers more options than you get with the free Google apps. For example, you can specify that a document can be shared only with members of your organization, or only members of your organization to whom you've sent a sharing link. As with the free Google office suite, you can specify that changes made to your document by your collaborators appear in color, to indicate that they're suggestions rather than actual edits. These suggestions can be accepted or rejected one by one by clicking on buttons in the comment panel at the right of the window. When you choose G Suite over Office 365 or Apple's apps, you're making a major decision to rely on data and apps that live almost entirely in the cloud, accessible only in a browser or a mobile device. Google doesn't supply desktop apps like the desktop versions of Microsoft Word or Excel or Apple's Pages and Numbers. If you want to edit your documents on a Wi-Fi challenged airplane, you'll need to edit them in Google's Chrome browser via an optional extension. And, before you go offline, you'll need to download every document that you want to edit. I'm not willing to take that kind of trouble every time I risk being somewhere—like a typical Amtrak train—where Wi-Fi may suddenly stop working. Office Suite in the Cloud In contrast with Google's cloud-only apps, Microsoft's and Apple's apps run either on the desktop or in a browser or mobile device, and the desktop apps have the kind of power that no mobile app can offer. Also, Microsoft's OneDrive and Apple's iCloud typically store copies of your documents on your hard disk and also in the cloud, whereas Google stores only links to your documents in the Google Drive folder that you can create on your hard disk. You can download your Google documents to your hard disk but only in formats like Office format or Open Document (LibreOffice) format, not in the Google Docs format itself. I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea that my documents live in the cloud in a format that I can't download on my hard disk, but this may not bother you as much as it does me. Cloud-only apps like Google's always have a reduced feature set compared to desktop equivalents, but the vast majority of documents and worksheets don't need any more features than Google provides. The apps in G Suite have Google's typically elegant interface, and I'm impressed with the way Google takes keyboard accessibility seriously. The toolbars and menus display keyboard shortcuts for almost every feature, so you don't need to strain your wrist mousing around the screen as you mostly need to do with Apple's apps. (Microsoft's online Office also offers plenty of keyboard shortcuts.) Editing and Versioning The Google apps keep track of all editing changes that you make on your document, going back to the time it was first created. You can revert to an older version of your Google Slides presentation or simply use the document-history feature to look back at an old version to find and copy text that you want to paste into the current version. Microsoft and Apple both offer a Track Changes option, but you need to remember to turn it on, and it's much more convenient to have it running by default. Apple's apps let you turn on revision tracking in the desktop version, but the online versions of Apple's apps don't support revision tracking at all, which can be a problem. If you use a browser to open a document that has revision tracking switched on, you won't be able to edit it. Another advantage in Google's apps is the Explore pane, which you can open from the menu or a keyboard shortcut. Like Microsoft's Smart Lookup feature, Explore searches the web for relevant information about your document. Unlike Microsoft's feature, however, Google displays a quotation-mark icon next to each of its search hits. Click on this icon, and the reference material is inserted into your document as a footnote. You'll probably need to format and revise the footnote text, but you'll avoid a lot of complicated steps required to add references in any other app. An Excellent Office Suite G Suite has plenty to offer any organization that needs a collaboration-ready office suite, a website, shared calendars, and mail services. Compared with Office 365, which exists on the desktop and in the cloud, G Suite is cloud-only, and that's either an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on your needs. Cloud-only apps are an advantage if you want to assure that everything produced by your organization is always available. They're a disadvantage if you want the full power of desktop apps, or if you need offline access to your files. I'm impressed with the ease, elegance, speed, and depth of G Suite, and if I still prefer to get my work done in Office 365, that's because I need the full power of desktop apps like Microsoft Word for the work I do. If your organization can manage with the relatively lightweight cloud-only apps in G Suite, and you don't mind keeping your documents in Google Drive, G Suite is a superbly powerful and elegant choice and an Editors' Choice winner for business-class cloud-based office suites.

By Rob Thubron on Mar 3, 2017, 11:50 AM 13 comments TechSpot With most companies releasing a new version of their flagship smartphones every year, it was expected that Google would follow the trend by unveiling the Pixel 2 in 2017. At Mobile World Congress, senior vice president of hardware at Google, Rick Osterloh, confirmed there would be new versions of the popular handsets released before year’s end. Speaking to AndroidPit, Osterloh said: “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it […] You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now." As the first Pixel arrived in October 2016, you can expect its successor to launch around the same period this year, which is also the time Apple’s $1000 iPhone 8 is expected. It’ll certainly be interesting to see the two handsets go head-to-head, and both may have to contend with Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 - set for release sometime during the last quarter of 2017. Back in January, there were rumors of another Pixel phone, this one a low-end device designed for emerging markets, being released alongside or just after the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2. However, Osterloh stated that “Pixel stays premium,” suggesting there won’t be a budget option available. 9to5Google – responsible for the first report - still believes the company will produce a cheap handset, but it won’t be a Pixel-branded one. Given the popularity of such devices in regions like India, don’t be surprised to see Google bring out a low-end phone purposely for these areas. We still don’t know much about the Pixel 2, other than some pretty obvious expectations: latest Snapdragon SoC, waterproofing, a better camera with multiple features, etc. But expect to find out more over the coming months.

Updated March 3, 2017 8:35AM SHARE ALSO SEE Uber Automotive Gender Discrimination Sexual Harassment Mobile Apps Lawsuit Human Resources Silicon Valley Ellen Pao Haana was so repulsed by what happened to her, she covered up her mirror so she wouldn’t have to look at herself. The Silicon Valley tech worker said that after drinks with startup colleagues last year, a male executive at her company put his hand up her shirt and groped her while they walked down the street. "I felt disgusted for months after that," said Hanna, who requested that the Guardian not include her full name or identify the small tech startup where she used to do marketing. "It affects me on a level that I wish it didn't." According to Haana, the CEO refused to fire him, and she eventually left the business. Her allegations are far from unique in Silicon Valley. On the contrary, in the male-dominated technology industry, female staffers and workers of color say sexual misconduct, discrimination and retaliation are rampant -- and that men in powerful positions are routinely protected while women are often pushed out of their jobs by harassment. Following the recent viral blogpost of Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer who chronicled claims of sexual harassment and mistreatment, the Guardian has found that similar allegations are widespread across the tech sector. According to a number of prominent attorneys, hundreds if not thousands of women and people of color in tech come forward each year with complaints of toxic work environments largely controlled by white men. Under the guise of "disruption" and "innovation," startups and tech corporations skirt employment laws and reject HR practices while sometimes fostering a party culture where young male executives encourage socializing and drinking. Often, founders hire and promote friends and people similar to them. In these settings, women are vulnerable to all kinds of abuse, ranging from lewd comments to unwanted propositions to groping to assault. "The scale is sort of breathtaking," said Kelly Dermody, an attorney who annually assists hundreds of women in tech and represents thousands across class-action lawsuits. "Most of the women I've worked with in startups have had stories where they have been physically touched, if not worse, without their consent.” In recent years, there have been public claims of sexism and discrimination at numerous high-profile technology companies, including Twitter, Apple, Oracle, Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google. Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google. But some say the problem is under-reported and particularly acute in early-stage startups where there are no HR departments. There, young CEOs may choose not to fire or reprimand executives who are college friends they consider vital to the company, and when founders or CEOs commit offenses, it can be impossible for women to find justice. More Like a Fraternity In a recent survey of more than 200 women in tech, 60% said they faced unwanted sexual advances, often from superiors. One in three women said they felt afraid for their personal safety, and 66% said they felt excluded because of their gender. The research was inspired by Ellen Pao, the former Reddit CEO, whose discrimination lawsuit against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers sparked national debate about misogyny in Silicon Valley. "Most women have experienced some version of this," Pao, who lost her landmark suit, said in an interview last week. She said she hopes the Uber case is a "watershed moment" that inspires the industry to fix a "fundamentally broken" culture. Therese Lawless, an employment attorney who represented Pao and the female engineer at Tesla, said the impact of the social scene at some of the companies can be extreme. "You have a culture which is more like a fraternity than it is a workplace … Sometimes it ends in disaster," she said. "There's a huge range, from sexual assault to propositions for sex to wanting sexual favors in the workplace to unwanted touching to showing of explicit pictures." When young startups grow their businesses at very rapid rates, they fail to properly invest in HR, said Jahan Sagafi, a lawyer with Outten and Golden, the nation's largest firm representing workers in claims against employers. "You have this insular group of like-minded and similar-looking people who are suddenly given immense privilege and opportunity and wealth. And before long, they can feel like they are above the law." Amélie Lamont, a former employee of Squarespace, the popular website design company, said that she felt obligated to go to bars with colleagues for regular hangouts. "If you weren't drinking, you weren't a part of the culture. That was frustrating," said Lamont, who last year published an account of facing racism and sexism as a black female supervisor at Squarespace. "That was really hard keeping up … If you skipped them, it meant you weren't really connecting with your coworkers. You weren't building a strong relationship." Haana, who is in her 20s and has worked for multiple startups, said she has had a close relationship with the CEO of her previous company for years. She said the chief technology officer groped her and that he was friends with the CEO. This kind of intimate nature of an early stage startup makes it challenging to deal with these kinds of conflicts, she said. "When you're involved in a startup, you kind of need to be involved in each other's lives," Haana explained. "You live, you eat, you work together." That made it all the more painful, she said, that no one seemed to take her concerns seriously. "What can I say to make people believe it wasn't my fault?" she said, noting that the incident had a long-term impact on her. "It's something that's a part of me, and I have to figure out how to deal with it. I don't know how to get rid of that anxiety." In phone interviews, the CEO said he didn't think automatically terminating the CTO was an appropriate response, and the CTO denied that he groped Haana but said it's possible she "misinterpreted” a "hug." Pao said the tight-knit nature of startups can make the experience of harassment all the more painful. "If you're not part of that group of founding friends, you're excluded. And that exclusion can take on many forms." 'They Were Going Out of Their Way To Try To Sabotage Her Work' While many victims of discrimination or harassment choose not to file legal complaints or go public, the ones who do speak out face serious risks. Days after her post about Uber, Fowler tweeted that people she knows were being asked for "personal and intimate" information about her as part of what seems to be a "smear campaign." Uber claimed it was not behind the investigation. The company also hired former attorney general Eric Holder to investigate harassment and vowed to hold offenders accountable. After Lamont, 28, went public about the prejudice and misogyny she said she faced at Squarespace, she faced an onslaught of nasty comments and harassing messages, with some branding her a liar and others lecturing her about how black women should behave. Lamont, who now works as a product design lead at the New York Times, said she was one of a very small handful of black women at Squarespace and that she felt white managers and executives didn't understand her experience. "I felt devalued," she said. "Even going into other jobs, I carried all the baggage." Squarespace did not respond to multiple requests for comment. After she published her post, Lamont said many women of color in tech reached out to share similar stories: "That was validating." One black woman told her about a manager who said she shouldn't wear her hair naturally in an afro or braids because she appeared "too ethnic." Another woman told her she was repeatedly given grunt work that didn't match her level of expertise. Jennifer Schwartz, another Outten and Golden lawyer, said she has represented a number of transgender women in tech who "face shocking and blatant discrimination and impropriety in all forms," including jokes like, "Have you decided today whether you're a man or a woman?" Schwratz said that for one trans female programmer she represented at a successful startup was "consistently marginalized," with men excluding her from meetings and ignoring her successes. "They were going out of their way to try to sabotage her work, creating a sort of clubbiness where the men were patting each other on the back for denigrating her." The woman, Schwartz said, eventually left the company. © 2017 Guardian Web syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Updated March 02, 2017. The company behind the popular messaging app Snapchat is expected to start trading Thursday after a better-than-expected stock offering. Snap Inc. passed its first major test on Wall Street on Wednesday as it priced its initial public offering of 200 million shares at $17 each. That is above the expected range of $14 to $16 and values the Los Angeles company at $24 billion. Snap's IPO is one of the most anticipated for a technology company since Twitter's stock market debut in 2013. Co-founders Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy will retain controlling power over all matters at Snap; the Class A stock being sold in the IPO has no voting power. Snap is getting the ticker symbol "SNAP" on the New York Stock Exchange. Prospects for Snap For Snap, which started its official bid to go public last Halloween, the looming question now is whether investors are in for a trick or a treat. Snap's Snapchat app is best known for disappearing messages and quirky facial filters for jazzing up selfies. It's popular with teenagers and younger millennials. While Facebook launched in the era of desktop computers and Twitter in text-based mobile, Snapchat jumped straight to photos and videos. In a sense, it's ahead of the game. But its user growth has slowed down in recent months. Blame Facebook. Growth slowed to a crawl since Facebook's Instagram cloned Snapchat's "stories" in August. With the feature, photos and videos shared by users play in a loop for 24 hours, then disappear. The feature helped Snapchat recover from stagnant growth before, but now it's no longer unique to Snapchat. After adding 36 million daily active users during the first half of last year, Snapchat picked up just 15 million in the second half. The number of people downloading Instagram's app has been accelerating during the past six months, suggesting a gradual shift away from the Snapchat app, based on an analysis financial advice site ValuePenguin did of activity in Apple's app store. While the higher-than-expected pricing looks good for Snap, its troubles aren't over. "What that number means for the longer term -- very little," said Chi-Hua Chien, managing partner at Goodwater Capital who originated the VC firm Accel Partners' investment in Facebook and later invested in Twitter while at another firm. Twitter, for example, shot up nearly 73 percent on its first trading day and now trades well below its IPO price. Facebook, meanwhile, saw its stock decline sharply for a few months after going public. Now, it's trading more than three times its IPO price, near a record high. Time Is Limited Snapchat started 2017 with 158 million daily active users, most of whom are people in their teens, 20s and early 30s. But many of them are finding Snapchat harder to fit in with daily life. Evan Rodriguez, a 20-year old student at Abilene Christian University in Texas, used to send snaps of funny stuff he saw throughout the day, just as his friends did. For instance, he might take video of a friend walking across campus and send it via Snapchat -- "Hey, I see you!" But something about the whole thing "just became cumbersome," Rodriguez said. "It was like one more thing to do." Celia Schlekewey, a 20-year-old University of Washington student who also works at a small business, liked the fact that when she first joined, it was "all just about sending pictures to your friends." Over time, the stories feature became a "big deal," and keeping up with friends and famous people became time-consuming. "It got to the point that if I wanted to keep up with everyone's story, I'd have to sit on my phone and watch it for 25 minutes," she said. Easing this feeling of pressure will be key for Snapchat, especially if it wants to attract older users. They might not have as much time -- or might not feel like spending that time on social media -- as their young millennial counterparts. Snapchat's Identity Since Snapchat was never about typing, the phone's camera is already its main focus. In fact, CEO Evan Spiegel has taken to calling it a "camera company," and this is how the company describes itself in its IPO documents. That doesn't necessarily just mean that Snap wants to make cameras, though last year it launched Spectacles, actual physical sunglasses that snap photos for you. Snapchat is more about image-based communication, said Chien of Goodwater Capital. Open the app, and you open a camera. Turn the camera to selfie mode, and you get a bunch of filters to overlay on your face. Because the images you send eventually disappear, there's less pressure to put forward your best self. Snapchat has often drawn comparisons to both Twitter, which also faces stagnant growth, and Facebook, whose users are highly engaged, just like Snapchat's. Ultimately, Snap doesn't have to be like either to succeed and can forge its own path and identity. LaVon Murphy, 45, a photographer in Portland, Oregon, uses Facebook to keep up with friends, Instagram to express herself through pictures and Twitter to keep up with the news. She added Snapchat recently to stay in touch with her 17-year-old son. "I don't really understand why he and his friends use the app so extensively, but I am trying to keep up," she said. "It allows me to be silly and show a silly side of myself to my son and it allows him to be silly with me." Snap just needs millions more like Murphy willing to make time for yet another social network. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Data from search engine Google indicates that six out of the top ten rising search queries  since the year began related to betting sites. Betting site Sportpesa led the list of search items with two other searches on the top ten list— Sportpesa.com and “sportpesa games” — relating to the site. Other betting companies on the list of top ten queries included ‘Betin’, ‘elitebet’ and ‘Betway’ ranking third, fourth and ninth respectively on the list. Sport betting has become popular over the last two years with numerous betting companies setting up shop in the country and punters from all walks of life striving to strike it rich. In early January, Swedish betting firm SpiffX became the latest to make an entry into the Kenyan market through a deal signed by Cheza Gaming Limited.

Other top search queries during the first two months of the year included “Two Rivers Mall” officially opened by President Uhuru Kenyatta last month. The mall, which is the largest in the region sitting on 100 acres, opened its doors on Valentine’s Day. French retailer Cerrefour is the anchor tenant. Nyeri’s deceased Governor Nderitu Gachagua was the most searched personality during the period under review as Kenyans sought for news on the leader who died at the age of 64 while undergoing treatment in London. Kenya Airways took the tenth position in the list with people following up on the announcement that Kenya’s main airport has been granted category on status. Other top ranking searches included e-commerce site Jumia, social networking sites Instagram, VK and Whatsapp. Google is the largest search engine in the world, processing 40,000 search queries each second and its search reports show a strong correlation with what many internet users find intriguing within a specific duration of time. betting betting tips sportpesa SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Do you have something to add to this story?

By Sam Levin PUBLISHED: MARCH 03 2017 Haana was so repulsed by what happened to her, she covered up her mirror so she wouldn’t have to look at herself. The Silicon Valley tech worker said that after drinks with startup colleagues last year, a male executive at her company put his hand up her shirt and groped her while they walked down the street. "I felt disgusted for months after that," said Hanna, who requested that the Guardian not include her full name or identify the small tech startup where she used to do marketing. "It affects me on a level that I wish it didn't." According to Haana, the CEO refused to fire him, and she eventually left the business. Her allegations are far from unique in Silicon Valley. On the contrary, in the male-dominated technology industry, female staffers and workers of color say sexual misconduct, discrimination and retaliation are rampant -- and that men in powerful positions are routinely protected while women are often pushed out of their jobs by harassment. Following the recent viral blogpost of Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer who chronicled claims of sexual harassment and mistreatment, the Guardian has found that similar allegations are widespread across the tech sector. According to a number of prominent attorneys, hundreds if not thousands of women and people of color in tech come forward each year with complaints of toxic work environments largely controlled by white men. Under the guise of "disruption" and "innovation," startups and tech corporations skirt employment laws and reject HR practices while sometimes fostering a party culture where young male executives encourage socializing and drinking. Often, founders hire and promote friends and people similar to them. In these settings, women are vulnerable to all kinds of abuse, ranging from lewd comments to unwanted propositions to groping to assault. "The scale is sort of breathtaking," said Kelly Dermody, an attorney who annually assists hundreds of women in tech and represents thousands across class-action lawsuits. "Most of the women I've worked with in startups have had stories where they have been physically touched, if not worse, without their consent.” In recent years, there have been public claims of sexism and discrimination at numerous high-profile technology companies, including Twitter, Apple, Oracle, Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google. Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google. But some say the problem is under-reported and particularly acute in early-stage startups where there are no HR departments. There, young CEOs may choose not to fire or reprimand executives who are college friends they consider vital to the company, and when founders or CEOs commit offenses, it can be impossible for women to find justice. More Like a Fraternity In a recent survey of more than 200 women in tech, 60% said they faced unwanted sexual advances, often from superiors. One in three women said they felt afraid for their personal safety, and 66% said they felt excluded because of their gender. The research was inspired by Ellen Pao, the former Reddit CEO, whose discrimination lawsuit against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers sparked national debate about misogyny in Silicon Valley. "Most women have experienced some version of this," Pao, who lost her landmark suit, said in an interview last week. She said she hopes the Uber case is a "watershed moment" that inspires the industry to fix a "fundamentally broken" culture. Therese Lawless, an employment attorney who represented Pao and the female engineer at Tesla, said the impact of the social scene at some of the companies can be extreme. "You have a culture which is more like a fraternity than it is a workplace … Sometimes it ends in disaster," she said. "There's a huge range, from sexual assault to propositions for sex to wanting sexual favors in the workplace to unwanted touching to showing of explicit pictures." When young startups grow their businesses at very rapid rates, they fail to properly invest in HR, said Jahan Sagafi, a lawyer with Outten and Golden, the nation's largest firm representing workers in claims against employers. "You have this insular group of like-minded and similar-looking people who are suddenly given immense privilege and opportunity and wealth. And before long, they can feel like they are above the law." Amélie Lamont, a former employee of Squarespace, the popular website design company, said that she felt obligated to go to bars with colleagues for regular hangouts. "If you weren't drinking, you weren't a part of the culture. That was frustrating," said Lamont, who last year published an account of facing racism and sexism as a black female supervisor at Squarespace. "That was really hard keeping up … If you skipped them, it meant you weren't really connecting with your coworkers. You weren't building a strong relationship." Haana, who is in her 20s and has worked for multiple startups, said she has had a close relationship with the CEO of her previous company for years. She said the chief technology officer groped her and that he was friends with the CEO. This kind of intimate nature of an early stage startup makes it challenging to deal with these kinds of conflicts, she said. "When you're involved in a startup, you kind of need to be involved in each other's lives," Haana explained. "You live, you eat, you work together." That made it all the more painful, she said, that no one seemed to take her concerns seriously. "What can I say to make people believe it wasn't my fault?" she said, noting that the incident had a long-term impact on her. "It's something that's a part of me, and I have to figure out how to deal with it. I don't know how to get rid of that anxiety." In phone interviews, the CEO said he didn't think automatically terminating the CTO was an appropriate response, and the CTO denied that he groped Haana but said it's possible she "misinterpreted” a "hug." Pao said the tight-knit nature of startups can make the experience of harassment all the more painful. "If you're not part of that group of founding friends, you're excluded. And that exclusion can take on many forms."

Uber claimed it was not behind the investigation. The company also hired former attorney general Eric Holder to investigate harassment and vowed to hold offenders accountable.

"I felt devalued," she said. "Even going into other jobs, I carried all the baggage." Squarespace did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

FCC Chair: Net Neutrality a Mistake Next Article > Typo Blamed for Amazon's Internet-Crippling Outage By Samuel Gibbs PUBLISHED: MARCH 03 2017 Amazon has blamed the outage of its S3 web service, which took down many different sites, services and devices across the internet, on a typo. The failure of a critical section of Amazon Web Services (AWS) called S3 (Simple Storage Solution) on Tuesday, led to sites such as Business Insider and Medium failing, while some people found they could not turn on their internet-connected lightbulbs because automation service Ifttt was knocked offline. Amazon said that at the time of the outage one of its engineers was attempting to diagnose why its billing service for S3 was running slowly. The engineer attempted to take a small subset of the servers for one of S3’s subsystems involved in billing offline for inspection, executing a command from Amazon's "established playbook." Amazon said in an apology to customers: "Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended. The servers that were inadvertently removed supported two other S3 subsystems. One of these subsystems, the index subsystem, manages the metadata and location information of all S3 objects in the region." Like most other cloud providers, Amazon's S3 and other services under the AWS banner are built with redundancy in mind, allowing things to fail without taking out the whole system. But it seems accidentally taking the wrong servers in the wrong quantity offline caused a cascade of more major issues. The problem was compounded by the fact that Amazon hasn't rebooted the indexing system parts of AWS relies on for years. Amazon said: "We have not completely restarted the index subsystem or the placement subsystem in our larger regions for many years. S3 has experienced massive growth over the last several years and the process of restarting these services and running the necessary safety checks to validate the integrity of the metadata took longer than expected." The issue actually only affected Amazon's Northern Virginia region, but that was enough to cause major problems for sites and services using that particular data center region. Amazon apologized for the issue and said that it has put schemes in place to avoid the same problems caused by human error in the future. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

How to monitor Google Knowledge Graph changes and performance Detailed and accurate Knowledge Graph results are sought after by brands, businesses and individuals alike, but few have a way to actively monitor their listings. Columnist Tony Edward shares his method for doing so. Tony Edward on March 3, 2017 at 10:39 am More Google’s Knowledge Graph is a very prominent part of organic search results. By now, searchers are accustomed to seeing the panel that appears on the right side of the search result page that provides information about entities such as people, places and brands. Individuals and companies alike are striving to acquire, maintain and monitor a Knowledge Graph listing. At the moment, however, there is no easy way to report on Knowledge Graph performance and changes. In 2016, Google’s John Mueller did mention that links in Knowledge Graph panels would be counted in the Search Analytics report in Google Search Console. However, this still does not give us insight into the algorithmic aspect of Knowledge Graph rankings and changes. Why monitor your Knowledge Graph result? So you may be wondering why should you should care about changes to your personal or company Knowledge Graph result. Here are a couple of reasons. You (or your business) may share a name with another entity, or maybe you’re competing against a generic term. Whoever has the most relevance and highest score within the Knowledge Graph algorithm will rank better, and their Knowledge Graph panel will be the one to appear in search results for an unmodified query. Here is an example of a basketball player, author and actor ranking for the name, “Isaiah Thomas.” As you can see, each entity has a score and a different classification type. Not all Knowledge Graph panels are created equal, and Google will add more information to the panel as it discovers information about a person or company. Monitoring changes to a Knowledge Graph result can help you better understand how Google perceives you or your company. It can also validate certain optimizations you may be doing on your website — for example, using structured data. Also, if Google makes a mistake with your information, which can definitely happen, you will know before it’s too late. Monitoring your Knowledge Graph entry In my effort to find a simple solution for tracking Knowledge Graph changes for me and my clients, I found the following solution. It involves using the Google Knowledge Graph API and a tool called VisualPing. By generating an HTTP request for the Knowledge Graph API results and using VisualPing, a tool that monitors web page changes, I can easily track changes within the Knowledge Graph API results. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how to set this up. 1. Set up a Google API Manager account and generate an API Key. 2. Once your API key is generated, visit the Google Knowledge Graph API tool and conduct a search for an entity. Once the results have loaded, grab the URL under the “Request” section, which outlines the HTTP request URL format. Here is URL for my query: 3. Add the API Key you generated into the request URL. Original URL: https://kgsearch.googleapis.com/v1/entities:search?query=Tony+Edward&key={YOUR_API_KEY} Updated URL with API Key: https://kgsearch.googleapis.com/v1/entities:search?query=tony+edward&key=AIzaSyDlqL-acWjyy7UAXZPVOpXw3q1gMiQ8apc Here is what the updated URL looks like in a browser. As you can see, it loads the Knowledge Graph API results for my query directly on the page. Now that this is set up like a web page, we can easily track changes on it.   4. From here, create a VisualPing account and set up a job to track changes for your API Request URL.

By Sam Levin PUBLISHED: MARCH 03 2017 Haana was so repulsed by what happened to her, she covered up her mirror so she wouldn’t have to look at herself. The Silicon Valley tech worker said that after drinks with startup colleagues last year, a male executive at her company put his hand up her shirt and groped her while they walked down the street. "I felt disgusted for months after that," said Hanna, who requested that the Guardian not include her full name or identify the small tech startup where she used to do marketing. "It affects me on a level that I wish it didn't." According to Haana, the CEO refused to fire him, and she eventually left the business. Her allegations are far from unique in Silicon Valley. On the contrary, in the male-dominated technology industry, female staffers and workers of color say sexual misconduct, discrimination and retaliation are rampant -- and that men in powerful positions are routinely protected while women are often pushed out of their jobs by harassment. Following the recent viral blogpost of Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer who chronicled claims of sexual harassment and mistreatment, the Guardian has found that similar allegations are widespread across the tech sector. According to a number of prominent attorneys, hundreds if not thousands of women and people of color in tech come forward each year with complaints of toxic work environments largely controlled by white men. Under the guise of "disruption" and "innovation," startups and tech corporations skirt employment laws and reject HR practices while sometimes fostering a party culture where young male executives encourage socializing and drinking. Often, founders hire and promote friends and people similar to them. In these settings, women are vulnerable to all kinds of abuse, ranging from lewd comments to unwanted propositions to groping to assault. "The scale is sort of breathtaking," said Kelly Dermody, an attorney who annually assists hundreds of women in tech and represents thousands across class-action lawsuits. "Most of the women I've worked with in startups have had stories where they have been physically touched, if not worse, without their consent.” In recent years, there have been public claims of sexism and discrimination at numerous high-profile technology companies, including Twitter, Apple, Oracle, Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google. Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google. But some say the problem is under-reported and particularly acute in early-stage startups where there are no HR departments. There, young CEOs may choose not to fire or reprimand executives who are college friends they consider vital to the company, and when founders or CEOs commit offenses, it can be impossible for women to find justice. More Like a Fraternity In a recent survey of more than 200 women in tech, 60% said they faced unwanted sexual advances, often from superiors. One in three women said they felt afraid for their personal safety, and 66% said they felt excluded because of their gender. The research was inspired by Ellen Pao, the former Reddit CEO, whose discrimination lawsuit against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers sparked national debate about misogyny in Silicon Valley. "Most women have experienced some version of this," Pao, who lost her landmark suit, said in an interview last week. She said she hopes the Uber case is a "watershed moment" that inspires the industry to fix a "fundamentally broken" culture. Therese Lawless, an employment attorney who represented Pao and the female engineer at Tesla, said the impact of the social scene at some of the companies can be extreme. "You have a culture which is more like a fraternity than it is a workplace … Sometimes it ends in disaster," she said. "There's a huge range, from sexual assault to propositions for sex to wanting sexual favors in the workplace to unwanted touching to showing of explicit pictures." When young startups grow their businesses at very rapid rates, they fail to properly invest in HR, said Jahan Sagafi, a lawyer with Outten and Golden, the nation's largest firm representing workers in claims against employers. "You have this insular group of like-minded and similar-looking people who are suddenly given immense privilege and opportunity and wealth. And before long, they can feel like they are above the law." Amélie Lamont, a former employee of Squarespace, the popular website design company, said that she felt obligated to go to bars with colleagues for regular hangouts. "If you weren't drinking, you weren't a part of the culture. That was frustrating," said Lamont, who last year published an account of facing racism and sexism as a black female supervisor at Squarespace. "That was really hard keeping up … If you skipped them, it meant you weren't really connecting with your coworkers. You weren't building a strong relationship." Haana, who is in her 20s and has worked for multiple startups, said she has had a close relationship with the CEO of her previous company for years. She said the chief technology officer groped her and that he was friends with the CEO. This kind of intimate nature of an early stage startup makes it challenging to deal with these kinds of conflicts, she said. "When you're involved in a startup, you kind of need to be involved in each other's lives," Haana explained. "You live, you eat, you work together." That made it all the more painful, she said, that no one seemed to take her concerns seriously. "What can I say to make people believe it wasn't my fault?" she said, noting that the incident had a long-term impact on her. "It's something that's a part of me, and I have to figure out how to deal with it. I don't know how to get rid of that anxiety." In phone interviews, the CEO said he didn't think automatically terminating the CTO was an appropriate response, and the CTO denied that he groped Haana but said it's possible she "misinterpreted” a "hug." Pao said the tight-knit nature of startups can make the experience of harassment all the more painful. "If you're not part of that group of founding friends, you're excluded. And that exclusion can take on many forms." 'They Were Going Out of Their Way To Try To Sabotage Her Work' While many victims of discrimination or harassment choose not to file legal complaints or go public, the ones who do speak out face serious risks. Days after her post about Uber, Fowler tweeted that people she knows were being asked for "personal and intimate" information about her as part of what seems to be a "smear campaign." Uber claimed it was not behind the investigation. The company also hired former attorney general Eric Holder to investigate harassment and vowed to hold offenders accountable. After Lamont, 28, went public about the prejudice and misogyny she said she faced at Squarespace, she faced an onslaught of nasty comments and harassing messages, with some branding her a liar and others lecturing her about how black women should behave. Lamont, who now works as a product design lead at the New York Times, said she was one of a very small handful of black women at Squarespace and that she felt white managers and executives didn't understand her experience. "I felt devalued," she said. "Even going into other jobs, I carried all the baggage." Squarespace did not respond to multiple requests for comment. After she published her post, Lamont said many women of color in tech reached out to share similar stories: "That was validating." One black woman told her about a manager who said she shouldn't wear her hair naturally in an afro or braids because she appeared "too ethnic." Another woman told her she was repeatedly given grunt work that didn't match her level of expertise. Jennifer Schwartz, another Outten and Golden lawyer, said she has represented a number of transgender women in tech who "face shocking and blatant discrimination and impropriety in all forms," including jokes like, "Have you decided today whether you're a man or a woman?" Schwratz said that for one trans female programmer she represented at a successful startup was "consistently marginalized," with men excluding her from meetings and ignoring her successes. "They were going out of their way to try to sabotage her work, creating a sort of clubbiness where the men were patting each other on the back for denigrating her." The woman, Schwartz said, eventually left the company. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Gmail Ups Attachment Limit to 50 MB Next Article > Snap Ready To Cash in with Better-than-Expected IPO By Barbara Ortutay and Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: MARCH 02 2017 The company behind the popular messaging app Snapchat is expected to start trading Thursday after a better-than-expected stock offering. Snap Inc. passed its first major test on Wall Street on Wednesday as it priced its initial public offering of 200 million shares at $17 each. That is above the expected range of $14 to $16 and values the Los Angeles company at $24 billion. Snap's IPO is one of the most anticipated for a technology company since Twitter's stock market debut in 2013. Co-founders Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy will retain controlling power over all matters at Snap; the Class A stock being sold in the IPO has no voting power. Snap is getting the ticker symbol "SNAP" on the New York Stock Exchange. Prospects for Snap For Snap, which started its official bid to go public last Halloween, the looming question now is whether investors are in for a trick or a treat. Snap's Snapchat app is best known for disappearing messages and quirky facial filters for jazzing up selfies. It's popular with teenagers and younger millennials. While Facebook launched in the era of desktop computers and Twitter in text-based mobile, Snapchat jumped straight to photos and videos. In a sense, it's ahead of the game. But its user growth has slowed down in recent months. Blame Facebook. Growth slowed to a crawl since Facebook's Instagram cloned Snapchat's "stories" in August. With the feature, photos and videos shared by users play in a loop for 24 hours, then disappear. The feature helped Snapchat recover from stagnant growth before, but now it's no longer unique to Snapchat. After adding 36 million daily active users during the first half of last year, Snapchat picked up just 15 million in the second half. The number of people downloading Instagram's app has been accelerating during the past six months, suggesting a gradual shift away from the Snapchat app, based on an analysis financial advice site ValuePenguin did of activity in Apple's app store. While the higher-than-expected pricing looks good for Snap, its troubles aren't over. "What that number means for the longer term -- very little," said Chi-Hua Chien, managing partner at Goodwater Capital who originated the VC firm Accel Partners' investment in Facebook and later invested in Twitter while at another firm. Twitter, for example, shot up nearly 73 percent on its first trading day and now trades well below its IPO price. Facebook, meanwhile, saw its stock decline sharply for a few months after going public. Now, it's trading more than three times its IPO price, near a record high. Time Is Limited Snapchat started 2017 with 158 million daily active users, most of whom are people in their teens, 20s and early 30s. But many of them are finding Snapchat harder to fit in with daily life. Evan Rodriguez, a 20-year old student at Abilene Christian University in Texas, used to send snaps of funny stuff he saw throughout the day, just as his friends did. For instance, he might take video of a friend walking across campus and send it via Snapchat -- "Hey, I see you!" But something about the whole thing "just became cumbersome," Rodriguez said. "It was like one more thing to do." Celia Schlekewey, a 20-year-old University of Washington student who also works at a small business, liked the fact that when she first joined, it was "all just about sending pictures to your friends." Over time, the stories feature became a "big deal," and keeping up with friends and famous people became time-consuming. "It got to the point that if I wanted to keep up with everyone's story, I'd have to sit on my phone and watch it for 25 minutes," she said. Easing this feeling of pressure will be key for Snapchat, especially if it wants to attract older users. They might not have as much time -- or might not feel like spending that time on social media -- as their young millennial counterparts. Snapchat's Identity Since Snapchat was never about typing, the phone's camera is already its main focus. In fact, CEO Evan Spiegel has taken to calling it a "camera company," and this is how the company describes itself in its IPO documents. That doesn't necessarily just mean that Snap wants to make cameras, though last year it launched Spectacles, actual physical sunglasses that snap photos for you. Snapchat is more about image-based communication, said Chien of Goodwater Capital. Open the app, and you open a camera. Turn the camera to selfie mode, and you get a bunch of filters to overlay on your face. Because the images you send eventually disappear, there's less pressure to put forward your best self. Snapchat has often drawn comparisons to both Twitter, which also faces stagnant growth, and Facebook, whose users are highly engaged, just like Snapchat's. Ultimately, Snap doesn't have to be like either to succeed and can forge its own path and identity. LaVon Murphy, 45, a photographer in Portland, Oregon, uses Facebook to keep up with friends, Instagram to express herself through pictures and Twitter to keep up with the news. She added Snapchat recently to stay in touch with her 17-year-old son. "I don't really understand why he and his friends use the app so extensively, but I am trying to keep up," she said. "It allows me to be silly and show a silly side of myself to my son and it allows him to be silly with me." Snap just needs millions more like Murphy willing to make time for yet another social network. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

The failure of a critical section of Amazon Web Services (AWS) called S3 (Simple Storage Solution) on Tuesday, led to sites such as Business Insider and Medium failing, while some people found they could not turn on their internet-connected lightbulbs because automation service Ifttt was knocked offline. Amazon said that at the time of the outage one of its engineers was attempting to diagnose why its billing service for S3 was running slowly. The engineer attempted to take a small subset of the servers for one of S3’s subsystems involved in billing offline for inspection, executing a command from Amazon's "established playbook." Amazon said in an apology to customers: "Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended. The servers that were inadvertently removed supported two other S3 subsystems. One of these subsystems, the index subsystem, manages the metadata and location information of all S3 objects in the region." Like most other cloud providers, Amazon's S3 and other services under the AWS banner are built with redundancy in mind, allowing things to fail without taking out the whole system. But it seems accidentally taking the wrong servers in the wrong quantity offline caused a cascade of more major issues. The problem was compounded by the fact that Amazon hasn't rebooted the indexing system parts of AWS relies on for years. Amazon said: "We have not completely restarted the index subsystem or the placement subsystem in our larger regions for many years. S3 has experienced massive growth over the last several years and the process of restarting these services and running the necessary safety checks to validate the integrity of the metadata took longer than expected." The issue actually only affected Amazon's Northern Virginia region, but that was enough to cause major problems for sites and services using that particular data center region. Amazon apologized for the issue and said that it has put schemes in place to avoid the same problems caused by human error in the future. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Welcome To Your New Office Space Next Article > Dell Eyes Mid-Market With Hybrid Cloud Offering PUBLISHED: MARCH 03 2017 With an eye toward expanding its hyper-converged infrastructure business to mid-market enterprises, Dell is launching a new hybrid cloud computing offering that integrates its cloud platform with its VxRail appliance. Dell EMC is adding its Enterprise Hybrid Cloud platform, which is specifically designed to create hybrid cloud infrastructures, to its VxRail appliance, which runs on VMware`s vSAN software, and offers compute, storage and virtualization in a single box configuration. EMC first introduced the VxRail appliance in 2016, before the merger with Dell was complete. It`s now listed as a Dell EMC product, and the company claims to have sold 8,000 VxRail nodes in the past 12 months. Since completing the $67 billion merger with EMC, Dell has focused on hybrid cloud deployments and selling the underlying equipment and software to build these types of infrastructures. A recent report by IDC found that Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are still the leading suppliers of cloud infrastructure, although Cisco has gained ground in the market over the last several months. The first version of the VxRail appliance targeted business running more than 1,000 virtual machines (VMs) within the data center. The latest version of the appliance, along with the hybrid cloud platform, is geared toward businesses running 200 to 1,000 VMs that are interested in moving some workloads and applications to the cloud, whether that`s a private cloud or a public platform. The mid-market firms that Dell is eyeing include businesses with about 500 employees, but that have specific cloud infrastructure needs, such as law firms and hospitals, said Peter Cutts, senior vice president of Hybrid Cloud Platforms for Dell EMC. "If you take a step back and look at the trends in the cloud, you see the way services are changing dramatically, and IT is trying to be a value center rather than a cost center, and that is transforming the way they are delivering services," said Cutts in an interview before the launch. "They want a turnkey solution. They want to go to a self-service portal and get the resources that they need within minutes or hours and have the infrastructure do all the work for them." Eric Slack, a senior analyst with the Evaluator Group, wrote in an email to Light Reading that a hyperconverged infrastructure approach to cloud is gaining traction with mid-market companies those firms with less than 1,000 employees that need it for specific deployments and applications. He also noted that smaller companies have to content with large amounts of data and that makes for a challenge. "These aren't 'enterprises' but still large companies often with a lot of data," Slack wrote. "Cloud is more of an approach than a product, per se. To a large extent all companies are striving to adopt cloud-like characteristics in their IT environments -- agility, efficiency, flexibility, etc There are some drivers for keeping data on-site, such as compliance and control, but we see an economic aspect too." The Dell EMC Enterprise Hybrid Cloud platform offers a number of features for rolling out a hybrid deployments, including optimization for smaller deployments, automation of the software stack on the VxRail appliance and a subscription-based support service. Dell expects the VxRail appliance with the Enterprise Hybrid Cloud platform to ship on March 31. © 2017 Law & Industry Daily under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Anna Leach and Olivia Boyd. Updated March 3, 2017 8:35AM SHARE ALSO SEE Smartphone Environment Electronic Waste E-Waste Recycling Mobile World Congress At the smartphone world’s annual shindig in Barcelona, there are some things the tech giants have been trying to get people talking about -- the relaunch of the Nokia 3310, BlackBerry’s new fingerprint scanner, Samsung’s virtual reality headset. But there’s another, less glamorous story that they haven’t been so keen to promote. And that concerns the fate of their gadgets when consumers have finished with them. On Sunday, Greenpeace interrupted a Samsung press conference to protest the company’s failure to produce a recycling plan for the defective Galaxy Note 7, recalled last year due to fire risk. The campaign group claims Samsung has 4.3m handsets to get rid of. A Samsung spokesperson has since said the company is working 'to ensure a responsible disposal plan" for its defunct phones, and prioritizing safety and environment. But if the piled up Galaxy Note 7s go the same way as the rest of our old smartphones, computers and tablets, where might they end up? Sending E-Waste Offshore Since the start of 2017, we have thrown out more than 6.4m tons of electronic goods, according to The World Counts, a website keeping a live tally of global e-waste. If past patterns are any judge, not much of this will get properly recycled: less than a sixth of the e-waste discarded around the world in 2014 was dealt with in this way, says the UN. Even in developed countries with advanced infrastructure, electronics recycling rates are low. The US recycled just 29% (pdf) of the 3.4m ton of e-waste it produced in 2012, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, while the rest was sent to landfill or incinerated. "Our recycling rates for electronics are abysmal," says Jim Puckett, executive director and founder of the Basel Action Network (BAN), an NGO. He estimates that 5% of metals used in electronics are recycled, at most. When products are handed over for recycling, a portion end up in informal recycling hotspots in developing countries, such as Accra in Ghana or parts of southern China, where they are broken down in an uncontrolled environment, Puckett explains. UN figures suggest up to 90% of the world’s e-waste is illegally dumped. "We sweep everything to developing countries where they have the least infrastructure and efficient recycling," says Puckett. In a recent experiment, BAN placed GPS trackers on 205 old printers and monitors to see what happened to them. Of the devices handed over for recycling, 40% were sent offshore, mostly to Asia. BAN’s team followed 37 of them to Hong Kong, where it found workers breaking down electronics by hand in informal junkyards. This kind of unregulated processing of e-waste carries severe consequences for environment and human health, including air pollution when circuit boards are heated to access the metals, soil pollution as chemicals seep into the earth, and water pollution as toxic materials get into groundwater and other supplies. Lost Value Recycling failures also lead to a waste of precious materials, like gold, copper and platinum. This not only means that fresh supplies are mined unnecessarily, but also that money is wasted through missed recycling opportunities. Potential revenues from e-waste recycling in the European market in 2014 were as high as 2bn euros, estimates Sheffield University’s center for energy, environment and sustainability. Companies including Microsoft and Dell have sought to address their e-waste footprint by partnering with third-party organizations like Goodwill, which sells or recycles donated electronics. Last year Apple unveiled a recycling robot called Liam, who it says can take apart an iPhone in 11 seconds. More recent ideas have included a mobile phone offset scheme, launched on Tuesday by recycling company Sims Recycling Solutions and Dutch social enterprise Closing the Loop. They promise to remove one phone from an e-waste dump for every phone used by the scheme’s customers, including ING Bank. Puckett believes more systemic change is needed, however. When it comes to tackling the sheer quantity of discarded electronics, he says progress will only come via market-based incentives for longer-lasting electronics. A system where electronics are leased out rather than bought and sold, for example, would incentivize companies to make products last as long as possible, he says. © 2017 Guardian Web syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Updated March 01, 2017. Spring has sprung early -- potentially record early -- in much of the United States, bringing celebrations of shorts weather mixed with unease about a climate gone askew. Crocuses, tulips and other plants are popping up earlier than usual from Arizona to New Jersey and down to Florida. Washington is dotted with premature pink blossoming trees. Grackles, red-winged blackbirds and woodpeckers are just plain early birds this year. The unseasonably warm weather has the natural world getting ahead of -- even defying -- the calendar, scientists said Tuesday. In cities like Indianapolis, Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio, spring has arrived about a month earlier than the 30-year average and about 20 days earlier than in 2012, which was the earliest spring on record. Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Phenology Network, which studies seasonal signs, have calculated local and a national spring index based on observations of lilacs, honeysuckles and temperature records that are fed into a computer model. The spring leaf index goes back to 1900 and 2012 has been the earliest on record . But preliminary records show this year ahead of 2012 in a good chunk of the nation . It's still too early to draw a conclusion for the country, said University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee scientist Mark D. Schwartz and phenology network director Jake Weltzin. As the world warms, spring is arriving earlier, but not everywhere. For a broad swath of the U.S., 2017 sticks out like a crocus in early February. Nashville, St. Louis, Washington, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Columbus and Indianapolis are at least three weeks early on the spring index, but Phoenix and Los Angeles are running a bit late. "It's weird," Weltzin said Tuesday. The latest early spring isn't supposed to show up for decades based on computer simulations that model springs of the future, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the private Weather Underground. "This is basically a year 2100 sort of spring that we're seeing this year," Masters said. "Way surprising." Fox butterflies are already out in Massachusetts and New York. Beetles are scurrying around Martha's Vineyard. Crocuses and snowdrops are in full flower in suburban Boston -- all exceptionally early because of warm temperatures and little snow cover, said Boston University biology professor Richard Primack. "I am already hearing woodpeckers knocking on tree trunks" when these sounds usually occur in March or April, said Primack, editor of the journal Biological Conservation. The northern shoveler duck is usually the next to last duck to make it to upstate New York, arriving sometime in April, but it's already here, said Kevin McGowan, an ornithologist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology : These wildlife sightings stem from warm weather in February that Masters called "off-the-charts weird" that included upper 90s in Oklahoma and a first-of-its-kind February tornado in Massachusetts. Masters and Penn State University climate scientist Michael Mann, who photographed flowers sprouting outside his central Pennsylvania house in mid-February, said this is a combination of natural weather variation and man-made warming of the climate. Warm weather can lead to crop damage if there is a freeze in March or April after plants have already bloomed. It can also worsen droughts, which happened in 2012, Schwartz said. Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb said what's happening is disconcerting, no matter how nice it is for people. "Sure we can't wait to shed our wool coats and hats each spring, but such warm temperatures are wreaking havoc, sight unseen on key crops," Cobb said in an email. "Here in Georgia peach buds have been robbed of necessary 'chill hours' this winter." The early spring is even changing language with some calling recent weeks "alt-spring" and "March-uary." Penn State meteorology professor David Titley, said it feels like being on one of the recently discovered Earth-size planets around a nearby star. "Everything is kind of familiar (weather-wise) but different. I was walking around ... in my shirt sleeves and I was almost hot. In February. That's not supposed to happen," said the retired admiral. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

It is no longer available for new publishers to sign up for. So if you want to use it on a new blog or you are new to AdSense, you need to find a different plugin. On April 5, 2017 existing publishers will not be able to change their ad settings or ad units through the plugin. Then on May 3, 2017 Google will no longer provide support for the plugin. Google said "We frequently review our products and features to ensure they're providing maximum value to our users. After reviewing the AdSense Plugin for WordPress, we've decided that going forward we can better support WordPress publishers through new innovative features like our automatic ad formats and other upcoming initiatives." Here are the "key dates" which I already summarized above: Early March, 2017: New publishers will not be able to sign up for AdSense by using the plugin. Early April, 2017: Existing publishers will not be able to change their ad settings or ad units through the plugin. Early May, 2017: Google will no longer provide support for the plugin.

Anytime. Anywhere. Sexual Harassment on 'Breathtaking' Scale in Silicon Valley? By Sam Levin PUBLISHED: MARCH 03 2017 Haana was so repulsed by what happened to her, she covered up her mirror so she wouldn’t have to look at herself. The Silicon Valley tech worker said that after drinks with startup colleagues last year, a male executive at her company put his hand up her shirt and groped her while they walked down the street. "I felt disgusted for months after that," said Hanna, who requested that the Guardian not include her full name or identify the small tech startup where she used to do marketing. "It affects me on a level that I wish it didn't." According to Haana, the CEO refused to fire him, and she eventually left the business. Her allegations are far from unique in Silicon Valley. On the contrary, in the male-dominated technology industry, female staffers and workers of color say sexual misconduct, discrimination and retaliation are rampant -- and that men in powerful positions are routinely protected while women are often pushed out of their jobs by harassment. Following the recent viral blogpost of Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer who chronicled claims of sexual harassment and mistreatment, the Guardian has found that similar allegations are widespread across the tech sector. According to a number of prominent attorneys, hundreds if not thousands of women and people of color in tech come forward each year with complaints of toxic work environments largely controlled by white men. Under the guise of "disruption" and "innovation," startups and tech corporations skirt employment laws and reject HR practices while sometimes fostering a party culture where young male executives encourage socializing and drinking. Often, founders hire and promote friends and people similar to them. In these settings, women are vulnerable to all kinds of abuse, ranging from lewd comments to unwanted propositions to groping to assault. "The scale is sort of breathtaking," said Kelly Dermody, an attorney who annually assists hundreds of women in tech and represents thousands across class-action lawsuits. "Most of the women I've worked with in startups have had stories where they have been physically touched, if not worse, without their consent.” In recent years, there have been public claims of sexism and discrimination at numerous high-profile technology companies, including Twitter, Apple, Oracle, Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google. Google and Tesla, where a female engineer shared her claims of "pervasive harassment" with the Guardian this week. At Uber, a top engineering executive also stepped down this week amid allegations that he was accused of sexual harassment at his previous job at Google. But some say the problem is under-reported and particularly acute in early-stage startups where there are no HR departments. There, young CEOs may choose not to fire or reprimand executives who are college friends they consider vital to the company, and when founders or CEOs commit offenses, it can be impossible for women to find justice. More Like a Fraternity In a recent survey of more than 200 women in tech, 60% said they faced unwanted sexual advances, often from superiors. One in three women said they felt afraid for their personal safety, and 66% said they felt excluded because of their gender. The research was inspired by Ellen Pao, the former Reddit CEO, whose discrimination lawsuit against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers sparked national debate about misogyny in Silicon Valley. "Most women have experienced some version of this," Pao, who lost her landmark suit, said in an interview last week. She said she hopes the Uber case is a "watershed moment" that inspires the industry to fix a "fundamentally broken" culture. Therese Lawless, an employment attorney who represented Pao and the female engineer at Tesla, said the impact of the social scene at some of the companies can be extreme. "You have a culture which is more like a fraternity than it is a workplace … Sometimes it ends in disaster," she said. "There's a huge range, from sexual assault to propositions for sex to wanting sexual favors in the workplace to unwanted touching to showing of explicit pictures." When young startups grow their businesses at very rapid rates, they fail to properly invest in HR, said Jahan Sagafi, a lawyer with Outten and Golden, the nation's largest firm representing workers in claims against employers. "You have this insular group of like-minded and similar-looking people who are suddenly given immense privilege and opportunity and wealth. And before long, they can feel like they are above the law." Amélie Lamont, a former employee of Squarespace, the popular website design company, said that she felt obligated to go to bars with colleagues for regular hangouts. "If you weren't drinking, you weren't a part of the culture. That was frustrating," said Lamont, who last year published an account of facing racism and sexism as a black female supervisor at Squarespace. "That was really hard keeping up … If you skipped them, it meant you weren't really connecting with your coworkers. You weren't building a strong relationship." Haana, who is in her 20s and has worked for multiple startups, said she has had a close relationship with the CEO of her previous company for years. She said the chief technology officer groped her and that he was friends with the CEO. This kind of intimate nature of an early stage startup makes it challenging to deal with these kinds of conflicts, she said. "When you're involved in a startup, you kind of need to be involved in each other's lives," Haana explained. "You live, you eat, you work together." That made it all the more painful, she said, that no one seemed to take her concerns seriously. "What can I say to make people believe it wasn't my fault?" she said, noting that the incident had a long-term impact on her. "It's something that's a part of me, and I have to figure out how to deal with it. I don't know how to get rid of that anxiety." In phone interviews, the CEO said he didn't think automatically terminating the CTO was an appropriate response, and the CTO denied that he groped Haana but said it's possible she "misinterpreted” a "hug." Pao said the tight-knit nature of startups can make the experience of harassment all the more painful. "If you're not part of that group of founding friends, you're excluded. And that exclusion can take on many forms." 'They Were Going Out of Their Way To Try To Sabotage Her Work' While many victims of discrimination or harassment choose not to file legal complaints or go public, the ones who do speak out face serious risks. Days after her post about Uber, Fowler tweeted that people she knows were being asked for "personal and intimate" information about her as part of what seems to be a "smear campaign." Uber claimed it was not behind the investigation. The company also hired former attorney general Eric Holder to investigate harassment and vowed to hold offenders accountable. After Lamont, 28, went public about the prejudice and misogyny she said she faced at Squarespace, she faced an onslaught of nasty comments and harassing messages, with some branding her a liar and others lecturing her about how black women should behave. Lamont, who now works as a product design lead at the New York Times, said she was one of a very small handful of black women at Squarespace and that she felt white managers and executives didn't understand her experience. "I felt devalued," she said. "Even going into other jobs, I carried all the baggage." Squarespace did not respond to multiple requests for comment. After she published her post, Lamont said many women of color in tech reached out to share similar stories: "That was validating." One black woman told her about a manager who said she shouldn't wear her hair naturally in an afro or braids because she appeared "too ethnic." Another woman told her she was repeatedly given grunt work that didn't match her level of expertise. Jennifer Schwartz, another Outten and Golden lawyer, said she has represented a number of transgender women in tech who "face shocking and blatant discrimination and impropriety in all forms," including jokes like, "Have you decided today whether you're a man or a woman?" Schwratz said that for one trans female programmer she represented at a successful startup was "consistently marginalized," with men excluding her from meetings and ignoring her successes. "They were going out of their way to try to sabotage her work, creating a sort of clubbiness where the men were patting each other on the back for denigrating her." The woman, Schwartz said, eventually left the company. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Review: Nintendo Switch Impressive Next Article > Twitter Adds More Safety Tools, Will Curb Abusive Accounts By Barbara Ortutay PUBLISHED: MARCH 02 2017 Twitter is adding more tools to curb abuse on its service as part of its ongoing effort to protect users from hate and harassment. Among other things, the service will attempt to identify offenders on its own, even if no one has reported them first. It is the second time in three weeks the company has released new ways to root out abusive material on its service. It's a sign Twitter is getting more serious about the issue; it's faced criticism for not doing more in the decade since its founding. Twitter's effort to automatically flag abusive accounts is a new twist. Previously, the company would take no action until users reported suspected abuse. Not that long ago, in fact, Twitter required the targets of abuse to make such reports themselves; it refused to take reports from friends, family or other third parties. Once it identifies accounts that repeatedly engage in abusive behavior, Twitter will place temporary restrictions on them. For example, tweets from such accounts will be visible only to followers or other users who deliberately search them out. "We aim to only act on accounts when we're confident, based on our algorithms, that their behavior is abusive," the company said in a blog post . In addition, Twitter is also giving users the option to filter the notifications they get when someone mentions them in a comment. For example, people will be able to filter out accounts without a profile photo, or unverified email addresses or phone numbers. This can be helpful in screening out accounts that have been set up solely for the purpose of harassment or trolling. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Home > Miscellaneous > Web Analytics > Google AMP Likely Will Inflate Your Traffic Metrics, Google Is Working On Fix Google AMP Likely Will Inflate Your Traffic Metrics, Google Is Working On Fix Mar 3, 2017 • 7:59 am | (3) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Web Analytics - Tracking & Conversion Measurements Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Christian Oliveira has documented an issue with using Google AMP and how it will likely inflate your Google Analytics and other analytics metrics. In fact, it can report four-times more traffic than is real. Truth is, this was documented and Google recommended you set up its own profile for now to separate this out. In any event, Google is aware of the issue and said it is complex but they do plan to work on it - one day. Here is Google's Malte Ubl on this concern: @bastanzio @christian_wilde this is essentially correct. Should be documented somewhere as a known issue.— Malte Ubl (@cramforce) March 2, 2017 @christian_wilde @bastanzio yes, but not an easy fix.— Malte Ubl (@cramforce) March 2, 2017 What is the outcome? This is how Christian summarized it: Unique visitors: as we have just checked, a user accessing from the same device, using the same browser and withouth deleting cookies, can be counted as up to 4 unique visitors depending on how he/she access our AMP pages. Sessions: if a user visits an AMP page, in any of the environments and leaves, there is no problem in terms of sessions. But, if he continue navigating our website, from the AMP page to any other non-AMP page on our website, apart from being counted as a new Unique Visitor, a new session is started, so it is counted as two sessions. Bounce rate: due to the previous reasons, when a session is divided in two, the first session would have only one pageview (so it will be counted as a bounce). The second session, if it only checks one page, would also be considered a bounce. So, the bounce rate will be increased incorrectly (the complete session should not be considered a bounce, but it ends being two bounce sessions). And this happens both for AMP and non-AMP pages. Pageviews per session: also in consequence of the previous reasons, instead of having 2 pageviews/session, we would have 1 pageview/session. Traffic sources: traffic coming from our AMP pages to our non-AMP pages from 3rd parties, will be counted as entry traffic (new sessions) and its source would be “Referral Traffic”, from cdn.ampproject.org (or yourwebsite.cdn.ampproject.org) We have no idea when this will be resolved by Google, it has been an issue since Google launched AMP.

We’ve got news about cyber security, smartphone sales, sponsored content and lots more. Don’t forget to download the famous Internet Statistics Compendium for further insight and analysis.  Amazon generated 471.4m clicks from paid advertising in 2016 Analysis from Adgooroo has found that Amazon topped all US paid search advertisers last year, generating 471.4m clicks in 2016, far beating the 245.6m generated by Weather.com.  Macys was third with 167.6m clicks, followed by The Home Depot with 146.1 clicks. Meanwhile, Apple ranked 17th with 57.8m clicks, becoming the only technology brand in the list.  65% of Brits access the internet from their smartphone A new report from Google suggests that the days of thinking of a smartphone as a secondary device are gone. In contrast to just 35% in 2012, 65% of people now say they regularly use their smartphone to access the internet – almost double the amount previously. Google’s study, which involved 625.000 interviews with consumers around the world, also found that three in four people in the UK now use a smartphone, with the average Brit now using 3.3 internet-connected devices. Lastly, 54% of Brits say they prefer to do a task digitally if possible, while 50% reach for their smartphone first thing in the morning, using it as their primary alarm clock.  48% of organisational leaders are unsure they’re addressing needs across digital platforms PointSource’s latest study has highlighted some of the key areas of concern for companies executing a digital transformation strategy. Despite an increased demand for seamless digital experiences at every step of the customer journey, many organisations are struggling to meet these higher expectations.  In fact, 48% of organisational leaders report that they aren’t sure they’re accurately addressing their audiences needs across platforms, while 84% say their organisation has outdated legacy systems that impact the ability to improve their digital experiences.  Cyber security breaches cost UK businesses nearly £30bn in 2016 New research from Beaming has revealed that 52% of British businesses fell victim to cybercrime in 2016. This indicates that 2.9m UK firms suffered security breaches, costing a total of £29.1bn. 23% of businesses suffered computer viruses and phishing attacks, making this the most common type of cyber threat. Meanwhile, 18% of businesses suffered some form or hack or data breach. The research also shows that cyber security breaches increases with business size, as 71% of organisations with more than 250 employees fell victim last year, compared to 31% with fewer than 10 people. Best Picture mishap drives social media engagement for Oscars Fresh data from 4C has shown how social media users reacted to Sunday night’s Oscars. Unsurprisingly, the Best Picture mishap saw the biggest surge, with over 634,000 engagements in the minutes immediately afterwards. The moment also generated 4,200 rebroadcasts across 728 channels in the US in the 10 hours after the event. In terms of brands, Cadillac’s 60-second advertisement drew 45,533 engagements and 89% positive sentiment, while Meryl Streep’s outfit change helped the designer Elie Saab earn over 21,000 engagements. Only 50% of consumers are using mobile coupons A study by Walker Sands has found that just 50% of US mobile users redeemed a coupon last year, despite the fact that 53% believe it would improve their in-store experience. With 57% of retailers currently offering mobile coupons, it’s not due to a lack of opportunity. Instead, it could be due to a disconnect between retailers’ offerings and consumer expectations for a digital streamlined experiences. With the majority of consumers still choosing paper coupons over mobile offers, it seems the latter is failing to provide anything of additional value. Almost two-thirds of insurers are neglecting mobile and tablet users From analysis of major UK insurers and aggregators, Dock9 has found that 28% are ignoring mobile and tablet users by failing to design websites for these devices.  Out of those that do consider these devices, 57% are still failing to create touch-optimised sites, making the customer quote-to-buy journey over a quarter longer than necessary. In a ranking of online quote-and-buy experiences, AXA, Go Compare and Simply Business came out on top in terms of the best, while Quantum PLC, Markel Direct and The Insurance Octopus were found to be the worst. One in six people bought a smartphone in 2015 A new report by the EU Intellectual Property Office highlights how in 2015, 12.9% of legitimate global sales of smartphones were lost due to the presence of counterfeits – an equivalent of €45.3bn. This comes from analysis of the number of smartphones sold in 90 countries in every region in the world, based on point-of-sale tracking of consumer purchases. The report also found that 1.3bn smartphones were sold worldwide in 2015, meaning that approximately one out of every six people on the planet purchased a smartphone that year.  Half of marketers feel disconnected from the c-suite In a survey of 600 global senior marketing professionals, Squiz has found that 50% feel disconnected from the c-suite. Despite 78% of senior marketers feeling confident in explaining the value of technology investments, 52% think that other c-level execs don’t understand marketing. Meanwhile, just 33% think that the c-suite understands the value of martech at a financial level. As a result of this, stakeholder buy-in is still a key challenge for 32% of marketers, with a further 28% failing to feel that they can confidently set goals that the whole business can support. One third of publishers are failing to correctly label sponsored content According to MediaRadar, more than one third of publishers are failing to label sponsored content correctly, risking both reputation and revenue. From the analysis of ads from 12,000 brands during 2016, the study found that 37% of digital publishers were not native compliant. However, there has been some improvement, since a previous study had found this figure to be 71%. Currently, the biggest culprits appear to be smaller publishers. 74% used terms such as ‘sponsored’ and 11% used ‘promoted’ rather than the FTC-approved "sponsored content". Lastly, 5% of publishers provided no labelling at all. Published 3 March, 2017 by Nikki Gilliland @ Econsultancy Nikki is a Writer at Econsultancy.

Telefonica SA’s O2 unit — one of the first mobile operators in Britain to offer car insurance — expanded its product line in February to include telematics boxes, which track people’s driving habits and can lead to cheaper premiums for youngsters. That’s stoking speculation that a wave of fintech companies will push into the market and disrupt the way insurers interact with customers. Cell-phone or internet companies could, for example, use the massive amount of data they hold on their customers to sell them car insurance, bypassing traditional brokers and price-comparison websites.  Alphabet Inc.’s Google entry into price comparisons last year failed, but analysts say the web giant could come back and have another go. “No doubt Google will figure out a way to come back,” said Christopher Ling, a regional leader at Capgemini SA’s insurance practice for the U.K. and Europe in London. “For O2, it’s more dipping a toe in the water at the moment. Other ideas could be using mobile-phone data for home and health monitoring and the insurance associated with that.” Google did not respond to requests for comment. The insurance industry has long feared the entry of companies such as Google, Amazon.com Inc. or Facebook Inc. which have a closer relationship to customers — and above all better data on them. The potential disruption to the market is adding to pressure on providers already seeing their investments hurt by record-low interest rates. Insurers are reacting to the challenge. Allianz SE Chief Executive Officer Oliver Baete has pledged to make Europe’s biggest insurer “digital by default” to help boost productivity and retain clients. Thomas Buberl, CEO of AXA SA, told investors last year that “customers are now used to buying things at Amazon to interact with Google and Facebook, they are demanding the same from us and, as you can imagine, buying an insurance policy at Axa is not yet quite the same as buying a book at Amazon.” O2 has jumped into “what is undoubtedly a very competitive market,” said Mark Evans, CEO of Telefonica’s U.K. unit. It plans to use technology “to identify driver behavior and therefore incentivize very attractive packages for those who drive responsibly.” Telefonica also offers car insurance in Spain and has offered products in the U.K. since 2015. Partner Up Fintech companies are already a growing, if limited, part of the global market: 173 startups focusing on insurance  got funding last year compared with 122 in 2015, according to venture-capital researcher CB Insights. The key for any newcomer will be finding the right partner, Capgemini’s Ling said. O2’s insurance business operates through a tie-up with Peterborough-based insurer BGL Group Ltd., which is also behind insurance offerings by companies including U.K. funeral care to supermarkets operator Co-Operative Group Ltd. and roadside-assistance company RAC. “The market for U.K. consumer insurance has always been incredibly competitive and another one in the mix certainly won’t help the margins,” said Ben Cohen, a London-based analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “It remains to be seen how new entrants in the insurance market grapple with data-privacy issues.” Shock Suggestion Citigroup Inc. analysts provided a wake-up call for the insurance industry a year ago when they suggested Google’s parent should buy insurer American International Group Inc. and turn it into a laboratory for innovation, possibly using the tech company’s client data to set policy prices. Alphabet shut down its Google Compare service, which included insurance, in 2016 after the site failed to generate substantially more revenue that standard search ads for the products, the Wall Street Journal reporter at the time. But Baidu Inc., Google’s Chinese equivalent, and hedge-fund firm Hillhouse Capital Management Ltd. formed a venture with Allianz in 2015 to provide digital-insurance services in the Asian nation. “Monetizing mobile data is an incredibly exciting proposition,” Capgemini’s Ling said. “Other people will start to realize the potential of that in the same way as Google has realized the potential of monetizing Internet traffic.” Copyright 2017 Bloomberg.

However, underneath, it appears that Google is finally working on proper image search in version 6.14 and is adding other photo-related features. Not currently live, the feature will be accessible from the Google app’s navigation menu. Tapping ‘Visual Search’ will launch an interface with a camera view and a large bottom bar that tells users to tap on any part of the image. A top bar shows the Google logo as well as a beta tag. After selecting a part of the photo, users will be presented with a carousel of search suggestions in a card-like format that features a corresponding cover image. Tapping on one will open full search results. Searching with images is technically already possible with Screen search (previously Now on Tap), though the workflow is not too obvious. Then again, with Google Assistant — which began rolling out yesterday — not having this functionality, it makes sense to have a dedicated part of the app for this feature. Other changes in this version include the save feature in Google Images being added to the navigation drawer. ‘Saves’ is organized with tabs for ‘Saved items’ and ‘Tags.’ Its new location is much more accessible then first having to go to the image tab and might encourage usage of the feature. Neither ‘Visual Search’ or ‘Saves’ is live, though it might be enabled for some users as part of A/B testing. Sign up to beta test the Google app here.

With this update, when users apply one of the app’s “looks” to a photo, Google Photos will now correct the image’s white balance, in addition to its exposure and saturation. Google introduced the “looks” feature in Google Photos late last year. Users can choose from a variety of looks, which will alter a picture in numerous ways. Jingyu Cui, software engineer for Google Photos, explained looks in a November 2016 blog post: These unique looks make edits based on the individual photo and its brightness, darkness, warmth, or saturation, before applying the style. All looks use machine intelligence to complement the content of your photo, and choosing one is just a matter of taste. Auto white balance in looks is now rolling out to Google Photos users on Android and the web. The feature is coming soon to iOS. Elsewhere, Google shared six tips to help users improve their images.

Locksmiths try again to sue Google over fake local listings Search engines can assert immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Greg Sterling on March 3, 2017 at 10:43 am More Here’s a familiar story: a group of locksmiths has filed a class action lawsuit against Google, Microsoft and Yahoo. They claim the search engines (Google in particular) are deliberately “flooding” organic results with “scam locksmith listings” known to be false. They argue the fake listings force legitimate locksmiths to buy ads to gain access to customers who would otherwise see them via organic search results. The case is in Federal District Court in Washington, D.C. These are some of the alleged facts from the complaint: Defendants knowingly and deliberately flood organic search results displayed in response to queries such as “locksmith” (and related terms) with scam locksmith listings they know: 1) do not exist at all, or at least not at the locations indicated, 2) operate for the purpose of defrauding the consumer public, 3) are not licensed in jurisdictions mandating locksmith licensing, 4) are unregistered to do business in jurisdictions (such as DC) requiring business registration. Defendants flood the market with fictitious listings to dilute Plaintiffs’ and other legitimate locksmiths’ listing in the organic and map results to the point of obscurity, thereby compelling legitimate locksmiths to pay Defendants for paid advertised results merely to be seen by the same prospective customers. (emphasis added) Among the legal claims being made by the locksmiths are: conspiracy, fraud, unfair competition and other claims under various state and federal laws. The plaintiffs argue that Google “is fully aware of the nation-wide scam problem and is doing little to address the issue” because it and the other search engines financially benefit from the presence of these scam listings. They further claim that most jurisdictions have licensing requirements for locksmiths and that those rules have been willfully disregarded by the search engines. (Google and the other engines are certainly aware of the issue because they’ve been sued over the same issue before.) Plaintiffs represent a potential nationwide class and are asking for Google to stop showing results, listings and map pins for locksmiths that aren’t licensed in the jurisdiction. They’re also asking the search engines to “cease and desist publishing paid advertisements for unlicensed locksmiths in jurisdictions requiring locksmith licensing.” Damages sought by plaintiffs include “lost good will and ongoing client relationships” as well as “lost publicity.” The plaintiffs are also seeking punitive damages. While it’s easy to sympathize with the aggrieved locksmiths, the law favors Google, Bing and Yahoo. They will likely be able to avoid liability under internet-publisher immunity provided by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

Google’s plans of rolling out the Google Assistant for Android devices was initially unveiled during the Mobile World Congress 2017. The availability of the update will not be in the form of an app. Instead, Google will introduce the Google Assistant to Android devices through the inclusion of a functionality in the Google Play Store. An update to Google Play services will pop up in the Google Play Store, which means you’re getting the Assistant on your device. Users must be using an Android Marshmallow or Nougat device with at least 1.5 GB of RAM and 720 px resolution screen to be able to avail Assistant’s new features. Google announced the expansion of the Google Assistant to Android devices via a tweet too.   Now rolling out to more @Android phones, it’s time to meet your #GoogleAssistant ? https://t.co/tu9bGCgo7F pic.twitter.com/aeWdgBTJH1 — Google (@Google) March 2, 2017 While the other eligible Android devices are waiting for the update, the LG G6 bagged the title of being the first non-Pixel phone to be shipped with Google Assistant. Google claims that “hundreds of millions of Android users” will now be able to use the Google Assistant, instead of the voice search feature. In order to activate the Google Assistant, all the user has to do is long press the Home button. Though Google hasn’t specified the list of “eligible” devices, the update will first be available to Android users in the United States, followed by the United Kingdom,Australia, Canada and Germany. As far as users in India are concerned, it has not yet been ascertained when the Google Assistant update will be launched here. likethis What's your reaction?

By Liam Tung | March 3, 2017 -- 13:57 GMT (05:57 PST) | Topic: Security After the Android bug bounty, Chinese researchers now receive the most rewards and the most cash from Google. Image: Google Google has raised its top reward for remote code execution bugs in its Google, Blogger and YouTube domains from an even $20,000 to $31,337, marking a 50 percent rise plus a bonus $1,337 or 'leet' reward. It's also bumped up its 'Unrestricted file system or database access' reward by 30 percent plus 'leet' to $13,337. "Because high-severity vulnerabilities have become harder to identify over the years, researchers have needed more time to find them. We want to demonstrate our appreciation for the significant time researchers dedicate to our program," security program manager Josh Armour wrote. As previously reported, Google in 2016 paid about $3m to security researchers who reported bugs in this program, as well as the Chrome and Android rewards program. Google has also revealed which countries' researchers are scooping up the most rewards. Hackers from China shot into the lead in 2016 from fourth spot in 2015 due largely to the Android bounty, which kicked off in mid-2015. Reports from Asia were up 300 percent last year, and these made up 70 percent of the Android rewards program, according to Armour. Android bugs netted researchers $1m last year. After China, the most rewards went to researchers in the US, followed by India, Germany, France, UK, Israel, Russia, Poland, and Canada. The distribution of payments paints a different picture of the performance of researchers in each country. Researchers from China picked up $675,000 last year, leading the world by the total value of rewards. In second place, Russian researchers earned $351,000, followed by Polish researchers who earned a total of $341,000, and US researchers who received $214,000. Despite being the third-largest source of bug reports, researchers in India earned $84,000 from Google, behind Taiwan on $156,000, the UK with $142,000, Ukraine's $139,00, the Netherlands' $106,000, Israel's $114,000, and Finland's $85,000. However, Armour noted that Google had received reports from 40 percent more Indian researchers and paid out 30 percent more rewards. The number of researchers participating from Germany and France was also up 27 percent and 44 percent, respectively. Google's breakdown of the $3m it paid researchers in 2016 shows that about $800,000 went to bugs valued at between $1,338 and $3,133.7. Rewards in the $5,001 to $7,500 bracket totaled over $700,000, while rewards greater than $20,000 amounted to $400,000. Signaling the large job of sifting through valid reports, Google's graph showing the distribution of bugs by severity shows that most of the reports it received were invalid.

Image: Cookie Jam/Youtube By Anisa Purbasari2017-03-03 15:47:17 UTC Mobile game developers will soon have a new tool to lure players to their latest releases. At the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco this week, Google announced a new feature called "Playables" for iOS and Android developers. It allows users to test-drive a lightweight version of a game within an advertisement. In other words, there's no app download required—and it all happens while you're in another game.  So much for our attention spans. SEE ALSO: This 'GOT' star teamed up with Google to capture Greenland's melting ice Playables is one of the formats available in Google's Universal App Campaigns, a tool that allows developers to have their ads placed across several Google properties just by writing a few lines of text. It's currently available to some advertisers, but the tech giant plans to start rolling it out to all Universal App Campaign clients soon, a spokesperson for Google said, so you can expect to see the feature more often.   Playables could eliminate the hassle of downloading a game only to figure out that it's kind of terrible, though Google admits the the feature was created mainly for developers. In addition to giving them an additional tool to reel in new customers, Playables can also encourage existing users to play a game even more than they already do.  A Google rep wouldn't say whether it plans to develop a similar feature for non-gaming apps but did say, "We anticipate that marketers and ad agencies will get very creative on how they use Playables to drive downloads as well as brand awareness and sales." CORRECTION March 3, 2017, 1:52 p.m. EST This article originally stated that Playables is available for Android developers. It is also open to iOS developers.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars CLOUD Google and Coursera launch Cloud Platform training courses for businesses Paul Sawers@psawers March 3, 2017 8:10 AM Tags: coursera, Google, Google Cloud, MOOC, top-stories Above: Coursera & Google Cloud Google has turned to online education platform Coursera to launch a handful of training courses centered on the Google Cloud Platform. Founded out of California in 2012, Coursera partners with businesses and educational institutions to serve more than 20 million online students a range of courses across business, technology, science, and more. It’s one of a number of so-called MOOCs — massive open online courses — to gain traction in recent years, and has raised around $150 million in VC investment. Back in September, Google announced the launch of Google Cloud, which was essentially a rebranding and repackaging of its numerous cloud services, including its public cloud infrastructure, Google Apps for Work, and various enterprise applications. With companies increasingly embracing the cloud for their in-house operations, Google now wants to school firms in everything from data analytics and operations, to machine learning and configuration management. It’s all about filling the skills gap and giving businesses the confidence to migrate to the cloud. “As more and more companies wish to take advantage of what cloud computing, data analytics and machine learning can do for their businesses, the gap between the knowledge needed to move to the cloud and the demand for such skills has grown enormously,” explained Louise Byrne, head of cloud training delivery at Google. “Lack of expertise and cloud skills is often cited as the top challenge for companies wishing to migrate their business to the cloud.” The courses have been developed by “Google experts,” according to a blog post post on the matter, who also lead on the teaching side of things. Today’s launch comes four months after Google snapped up Qwiklabs, a startup specializing in training courses for people to learn all about public cloud infrastructure services. And that acquisition, it seems, was the genesis for this latest tie-up with Coursera. Google is no stranger to partnering with online education startups. It has previously teamed up with Coursera rival Udacity to launch courses covering virtual reality, Android Basics, cloud fundamentals, tech entrepreneurship, deep learning, and more.

Google exec confirms premium-priced Pixel 2 Google Pixel 2 UK release date, price, spec rumours Google went from great-value smartphones to premium Android devices as it switched its phone line branding from Nexus to Pixel last October. So what’s in store for the next Google phone? We round up the Google Pixel 2 UK release date, price and specification rumours. It's been only a few months since the Pixel and Pixel XL became available, but there's already talk of a new Google phone By Marie Brewis | 03 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments It seems insanely early to be talking about new Google phones, with the Pixel and Pixel XL having only gone on sale in October, but if there are rumours we will report them. It's important to point out that all the rumours in this article come via a single source of 9to5Google's editor Stephen Hall. We're not doubting the source's credibility, but pointing out the fact we have no other source to back up any of the information. Plus, at this stage in the proceedings, plans have a tendency to change - Google is reportedly only at the hardware testing of prototypes stage after all. Nevertheless, here's what we know about the next Google phone, the Google Pixel 2. Latest update: Google Senior Vice President of Hardware, Rick Osterloh, has confirmed that a Pixel 2 will arrive in 2017. "There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it," Osterloh said. "You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now," Osterloh told Android Pit. Osterloh also said the Pixel 2 would retain its premium price. Also see: Google Pixel review and Google Pixel XL review Google Pixel 2 rumours: Will the next Google phone be a Nexus or a Pixel? Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's head of Android, told Bloomberg last October that while the company wasn't closing the door completely on Nexus it didn't currently have plans for any Nexus devices. Based on this alone we would suggest the next Google phone is a Pixel rather than a Nexus. Rick Osterloh, Google's Senior Vice President of Hardware, has also confirmed that the Pixel will get a successor in 2017. Google Pixel 2 rumours: Who will make the new Google phone? It's too early to know who will be making the Google Pixel 2, since we doubt Google has even made a final decision on that just yet. In the past we've seen Google phones manufactured by LG, HTC, Huawei, Samsung and Motorola. The maker of the new Google phone could be any of these partners, but equally it could be a brand-new hardware partner. We'll update this article when we know more. Google Pixel 2 UK release date rumours: When is the new Google phone coming out? We now know that Google I/O will be held 17-19 May 2017, during which time it will more than likely unveil a developer preview of its forthcoming Android operating system, Android O. This is important because the company has always used its annual phone releases as the launch vehicles for the final version of its latest operating system. Also see: How to install latest Android 7.1.2 Beta Allowing for a good few months of Android O betas prior to the final release, Google phones are traditionally unveiled in late-September/early-October. The current Pixel and Pixel XL were announced at a special event on 5 October 2016, and went on sale on 20 October. We'd expect a similar time frame for the Google Pixel 2. Google Pixel 2 UK price rumours: How much will the new Google phone cost? Rick Osterloh has confirmed that Pixel will retain its premium pricing in 2017. When it switched its phone line branding from Nexus to Pixel in 2016, Google moved away from high-value devices and toward more premium phones. The cheapest Pixel today costs £599, while the cheapest Pixel XL costs £719. 9to5Mac's source suggests we should expect at least a $50 increase on this due to improvements it is making to the camera and adding waterproofing. However, the same source also suggests Google is experimenting with a cheaper, lower-specified Pixel 2B that it hopes to launch at the same time or shortly after the Pixel 2 in emerging markets. If it goes ahead there is no guarantee we will see this cheaper Pixel in the UK. Google Pixel 2 specification rumours: What to expect from the new Google phone Through 9to5Google's source we know two key things about the upcoming Google Pixel 2: it will be waterproof, and it will feature an improved camera.  Hall tweeted in late-January that he recalled being told back in October that the next Google phone would be waterproof, and the fact the current model was not came down to an issue of time constraints, and the need to keep down costs. He says Google was forced to choose between upgrading the camera and making the Pixel waterproof. The current Pixel and Pixel XL are IP58 rated, which means they are dustproof and protected against spraying water, but not submersible or water-resistant. On the subject of the camera, Hall writes that his source has claimed the camera will be improved, not in terms of the megapixel count but in the number of extra features. Google particularly wants to focus on getting low-light photography right. The processor also gets a mention, and Google has apparently been testing models with both Snapdragon 835 and Intel chips, but has already ruled out cheaper brand MediaTek. The video shown at the top of this page is the latest creation from Concept Creators. It shows renders of what the Pixel 2 may look like, based on speculation and rumours, as well as some suggested specifications that are in line with what we might expect from a flagship phone arriving later this year. However, one interesting thing to note is the inclusion of a red Google Pixel 2. Does Google really have a red model planned, or is Concept Creator poking fun at its new Really Blue model with the idea of a Really Red model? Unfortunately we won't know until more leaks and rumours appear online. It does look pretty cool, though. We'll bring you more rumours about the Google Pixel 2 as we hear them.

I don’t recommend using a Chromebook for local music playback because most Chromebooks don’t come with much internal storage, so your device won’t be able to hold many songs anyway. But if you’re dead set on doing this, Enjoy Music Player is pretty much the only good option for it. One cool feature is that Enjoy can stream music from Google Drive, so that could be a good compromise for you. 2. Chat: All-in-One Messenger Whereas most activities tend to be harder on a Chromebook, chatting and messaging is actually easier thanks to this nifty app. With All-in-One, you can manage dozens of different messaging services in one place — no longer will you have to juggle several different tabs and windows. Popular services supported by All-in-One include WhatsApp, Skype, Slack, Steam, Discord, Telegram, Facebook, Yahoo, ICQ, and more. 3. Notes and To-Dos: Knotes If you need a heavy-duty note-taking solution, you can always resort to Evernote or OneNote. Both are at the top of their game and they both offer web versions that are pretty much on par with their Windows and Mac versions. I personally use OneNote for my big note collections. But for smaller notes and reminders, I use Knotes. This awesome app has everything going for it: super fast performance, clean and intuitive interface, as well as apps for Android and iOS for mobile access to your notes. It’s simple and it works. 4. Text Editing: Caret Chromebooks aren’t designed for intense programming so if you’re looking for a powerful text editor along the lines of Sublime Text, Atom Editor, or Visual Studio Code, you might as well stop now because you won’t be satisfied with anything you find. That being said, Caret works in a pinch. What’s nice about Caret is that it runs completely offline, which can’t be said for most Chromebook apps. It also has the fundamental makings of a serious text editor: tabbed editing, syntax highlighting, full-text search, project view, and a smart command palette. As long as you’re aware that it doesn’t do much more than that, you’ll be happy. I think it’s clear that Caret is the best text editor for Chromebooks Four Of The Best Text Editors For Your Chromebook Four Of The Best Text Editors For Your Chromebook Do you miss having a simple text editor on your Chromebook's OS? Although Google scrapped its native app, there are still alternatives available. Read More , but if you don’t like it for whatever reason, you should consider trying Material Neutron instead. 5. Distraction-Free Writing: Writer Chromebooks are awesome for writing, but the only downside is that you don’t have access to any of the excellent distraction-free writers available on Windows and Mac. The fact that I can’t use Scrivener or FocusWriter on my Chromebook is a real bummer. Hopefully one day… For now the closest thing is Writer, which actually isn’t that bad. It works offline so you can write anywhere and everywhere, its colors and fonts are themeable so you can personalize it to your pleasure, it supports word counts and writing goals, and the interface is perfectly minimal. The app is free but there’s a Pro version with extra features like exporting as an ebook, shareable stats and streaks, exporting to cloud storage, file revision histories, and more. 6. Image Editing: Pixlr Photoshop is the image editing king with GIMP coming in as a close second — neither are available on Chromebooks. And even if they were, most Chromebooks don’t have the hardware to support the heavy resource usage that both of them require, so it’d be a moot point for most users anyway. But there are plenty of image editors for Chromebooks Four Excellent Image Editors For Your Chromebook Four Excellent Image Editors For Your Chromebook Do you like editing and tweaking images but find the Chromebook's default editor too limited? Here are some alternatives. Read More , and the best of them is Pixlr. Most notable is the interface, which emulates the look and feel of Photoshop and GIMP. It also supports many of the features you’d expect including layers, filters, brush controls, cloning, spot healing, advanced adjustments, and more. It’s surprisingly good. 7. Torrenting: JSTorrent ($2.99) Didn’t think it was possible to torrent on a Chromebook, did you? I surely didn’t. But as it turns out, there’s a nifty JavaScript-based app called JSTorrent that can handle torrent downloads perfectly, and it works well on newer and older Chromebooks alike. And don’t think you need to be a pirate to make use of this app. There are many legal reasons for torrenting 8 Legal Uses For BitTorrent: You'd Be Surprised 8 Legal Uses For BitTorrent: You'd Be Surprised Like HTTP, which your browser uses to communicate with websites, BitTorrent is just a protocol.

Screen Capture: Clipular Chromebooks can take screenshots using two system-level keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl + Window Switcher captures the entire screen while Ctrl + Shift + Window Switcher captures a region of the screen according to your selection. These are fine, but what if you need a bit more power? Then Clipular might be for you. Similar to Greenshot and ShareX (on Windows) or Grab (on Mac), Clipular allows you to capture any portion of the screen, annotate it, auto-save to a location of your choice, sync with Google Drive, and one-click share to social media. A must-have app for anyone who takes frequent screenshots. What’s Missing That You Can’t Live Without? There are many Chromebook misconceptions floating around 5 Things You Didn't Know About Chromebooks, And Why You Might Want One 5 Things You Didn't Know About Chromebooks, And Why You Might Want One Here are 5 things you should know about Chromebooks if you're thinking of buying one. Read More , the worst one being that Chromebooks are too limited. That may have been true 2–3 years ago but is no longer the case now that web-based apps are more popular. The truth is, most average computer users are likely to be happier with a Chromebook than, say, a tablet or laptop of equal price. That being said, I’m fully aware that Chromebooks are not for everyone. If there’s a specific Windows or Mac app that you absolutely need, then now may not be the time for you to switch. Chromebooks can do a lot, but they still have a bit of catching up to do. How do you feel about Chromebooks? Are there any apps that you absolutely need before you can even think about switching?

With this update, when users apply one of the app’s “looks” to a photo, Google Photos will now correct the image’s white balance, in addition to its exposure and saturation. Google introduced the “looks” feature in Google Photos late last year. Users can choose from a variety of looks, which will alter a picture in numerous ways. Jingyu Cui, software engineer for Google Photos, explained looks in a November 2016 blog post: These unique looks make edits based on the individual photo and its brightness, darkness, warmth, or saturation, before applying the style. All looks use machine intelligence to complement the content of your photo, and choosing one is just a matter of taste. Auto white balance in looks is now rolling out to Google Photos users on Android and the web. The feature is coming soon to iOS. Elsewhere, Google shared six tips to help users improve their images.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 March 2017 by Military News San Mateo Home Care Company, NuevaCare Announces Upgrades to Google My Business Listing SAN MATEO, Calif., March 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — NuevaCare, a leading home care agency based in San Mateo, California, but serving Bay Area cities as diverse as Millbrae, Belmont, and Palo Alto, is excited to announce important upgrades to its Google My Business listing. Many potential clients use Google listings to evaluate home care providers when making an in-home care decision for themselves or loved ones. “The Bay Area is full of tech savvy consumers who love sites like Google and Yelp,” explained Kamran Nasser, CEO of NuevaCare. “By upgrading our Google My Business listing, we are making it easy for potential clients to learn about us on the Google platform.” To view the upgraded Google listing, visit https://plus.google.com/+NuevaCareSanMateo. Interested parties can also view the listing directly on Google at https://goo.gl/bPTq5L. Related to this update, the company has upgraded its San Mateo home care page at http://nuevacare.com/san-mateo-home-care/ Among the information upgrades to the Google My Business Page are the following. First, on the related Google+ page, the company has increased the frequency of posts about its blog, as well as relevant local events and information to San Mateo and nearby communities like Palo Alto and Millbrae. Second, the Google reviews (available on Google and connected on the backend to Google+) are visible directly on Google search not only for the brand name but, increasingly, for relevant search terms such as home care, caregivers, and in-home care where consumers are comparing and contrasting competing providers. Third, the company has beefed up its blogging and other social media activity, not only on Google+ but also on other venues such as Twitter or Facebook that can feed into local performance. Questions and Answers on Home Care Consumers today are likely to go, first, to online sites such as Google, Facebook, and Yelp to learn about home care services. Next, they tend to compare and contrast providers, looking not only at reviews but also on the company websites as well as blogs, reviews, etc. Issues that can come up include the types of assistance that are available, including 24 hour live-in care, hourly care, personal care including bathing, dressing, etc., as well as medication reminders and other non-medical assistance on an as-needed basis. However, persons with an active need for San Mateo home care (or home care in nearby cities) are encouraged to reach out for a consultation. No two clients are the same, and NuevaCare will configure its caregiver services to the needs of the individual and his or her family. The newly updated pages should be considered a first step towards learning about caregiver services, and comparing possible providers. About NuevaCare A premier technology based home care company based in San Mateo and servicing the San Francisco Bay Area, NuevaCare delivers responsive, quality, and affordable in-home care to those who need care due to old age or recovering from surgery or illness. NuevaCare services clients in diverse Bay Area cities from Burlingame to Santa Clara, San Mateo to Palo Alto, Foster City to Hillsborough and everywhere in between.

But now you can also get Gboard, the official predictive keyboard and Google Play Services in beta. The latter seems particularly odd to us, as Google Play Services is the part of Google that you never see, so really it's only useful if you're going to be trying out apps that use the new features held within. It looks like we could be seeing the full benefits of Google Home, specifically the Echo rivalling Assistant this summer over in Blighty. A loose lipped comment to the BBC sent everyone into a frenzy. Gmail users will now be able to receive attachments up to 50MB in size (seriously, guys, use Drive), but the outgoing message limits stay at 25MB. In 2017, no one should be sending huge attachments by email, but what are you going to do? YouTube is getting a live TV service in the states designed to attract the cord-cutter generation. Customers will be offered the major networks including quite a few of the big cable ones, a limitless DVR and a load more. It's launching on a regional basis, starting at $35. It's not likely to come to Blighty any time soon, but there's always TVPlayer for £5.99 a month that does the same thing. It seems that we've simultaneously heard that Google won't be making any more Pixel laptops (like the Android touting Pixel C) but will be making another high-end successor to the Pixel phone. Some panicking outlets have chosen to read that as the end for Chromebooks. This is of course, gak in a glass. Chromebooks are doing very nicely thank you, and will continue. µ Tweet   Facebook   Google plus       Send to   Topics Software Software cloud computing Google Android INQ Latest Twitch warns users of potential unauthorised account access Amazon-owned gaming service resets some user passwords Security 07 March 2017 Galaxy S8 and S8+ specs, release date and price Release date reportedly pushed back to 28 April Phones 06 March 2017 Microsoft's UUP shrinks Windows 10 updates by 65 per cent for Insiders Firm promises a 35 per cent reduction for retail users Cloud 06 March 2017 Hackers find 85 vulnerabilities in WD My Cloud range So you think your files aren't safe online, huh?

With reports that Apple is now focusing on an autonomous driving system, is Apple still manufacturing an iCar, and when will the iCar be launched? We look at all the evidence. Latest: Apple pens letter to US transport regulators. by Lewis Painter | 03 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Evidence that Apple is working on an iCar Evidence that Apple isn't working on an iCar When will the Apple iCar launch? Driverless or electric? What will the Apple iCar look like? Patents Leaked images Pricing Since February 2015, there have been various reports that Apple is working on a car that will "give Tesla a run for its money" after Business Insider spoke to an Apple employee with knowledge of the subject. This, coupled with sightings of cars registered to Apple, clad with sensors/cameras (which were later debunked), got everyone talking about the prospects of an Apple Car, or iCar. The iCar project is codenamed 'Titan', according to The Wall Street Journal, which originally stated there were "several hundred" Apple employees working on the project. With some reports describing an electric car and others describing a self-driving car, is there any truth to the claim or is it like the Apple TV set everyone was talking about a couple of years ago? Well… Updated with news of a letter penned by Apple to US transport regulators about self-driving cars, and speculation that the project has been given a target of 2017 to "prove feasibility". Evidence that Apple is working on an iCar Here is where we list some of the most prominent rumours suggesting Apple is making an iCar.  Also read: Apple rumours and predictions for 2016. Apple pens letter to US transport regulators about self-driving car rules While many had believed that Apple was stepping away from the autonomous car project, a recent letter penned to US transport regulators by Apple's director of product integrity Steve Kenner may suggest otherwise. Apple has apparently said that it was "excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation" and that there were "significant societal benefits of automated vehicles" to be realised.  An Apple spokesman has confirmed that the letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was prompted by its "heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems" and that it wanted to help define best practises in the industry going forward.  The letter urges regulators to not introduce too many rules regarding the testing of self-driving cars, claiming that "established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally". Kenner also suggests that companies should share data from crashes and near-misses to build a more comprehensive picture than would be possible by one company alone, helping to improve the systems.  Of course, with Apple being so focused on user privacy, it'd be out of character not to mention it in the letter. Kenner notes that an individual's privacy should not be compromised by the sharing of data, and that regulators "address privacy challenges associated with the collection, use, and sharing of automated vehicle data".  Apple CEO Tim Cook hints at motoring focus during Q4 2016 results During Apple's Q4 2016 financial results, Apple CEO Tim Cook answered a flurry of questions regarding Apple Pay, Siri and most importantly, the Apple Car. While the CEO neither confirmed or denied the existence of Apple's rumoured electric car, he said that Apple "always looks for ways that we can improve the experience and the customers' experience on different sets of products".  “And we are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an area that it's clear that there is a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionise the car experience.” he continued. "And so it's interesting from that point of view, but nothing to, certainly nothing to announce today." As usual, Cook is speaking in riddles, but if you read between the lines, it does hint that Apple may have something to announce somewhere down the line.  Apple hires BlackBerry engineers for autonomous car OS project in Canada Bloomberg reports that Apple and its Project Titan team - focusing on an autonomous car OS following the closure of the Apple Car project - have hired a number of former BlackBerry engineers as part of a new Canadian office in Kanata, a suburb of Ottawa. "Many of the engineers working in Canada were hired over the past year and about two dozen came from BlackBerry's QNX, a leading automotive software provider," writes the outlet, citing "people familiar with the matter". Among Apple's hires from QNX is Dan Dodge, the firm's CEO. QNX staff were targeted by Apple because of the company's experience "developing fundamental components of operating systems and power management", an ex-QNX employee told Bloomberg. Apple 'in talks to buy McLaren' According to a report from the Financial Times (paywalled) citing three sources with knowledge of the project, Apple is apparently in talks to buy luxury supercar maker McLaren with the aim of improving its iCar project. What the Financial Times isn't clear about is whether this is a major investment or an outright purchase of the company, stating: "The California technology group, which has been working on a self-driving electric vehicle for more than two years, is considering a full takeover of McLaren or a strategic investment, according to three people briefed on the negotiations who said talks started several months ago." While this may seem strange on the surface, there is logic behind the rumoured buyout. The successor to the hugely popular McLaren P1 is indeed rumoured to be electric, and as well as this, McLaren's Applied Technologies Group supplies electronics to a range of companies, to those within Formula One to NASCAR, and has apparently done an extensive amount of work on data center optimisation, ideal for Apple's self-driving electric car efforts.  Apple 'rethinking strategy on self-driving cars', lays off a number of staff According to a report from the New York Times, Apple is said to be rethinking its self-driving car strategy as other tech giants like Google and even Uber appear ready to start road testing their competing efforts. According to three people briefed on Apple’s move (that aren’t allowed to speak about it publically, of course), the company has laid off dozens of employees working on the project, signalling issues with Apple’s ambitious car project. It’s not the first time that Apple’s car project has been in trouble, as the company had to draft in Bob Mansfield, Apple veteran, in July 2016 to oversee the project and drive it forward as no real progress had been made. Apple is said to have told affected employees that the layoffs were a part of a “reboot” of the project, and of course, Apple has refused to officially make a comment. Autocar report According to a report by Autocar, Apple is planning on aggressively selling the new iCar at a rate of half a million cars per year. This projection is ten times the sales by Tesla - a figure hard to envisage. In the report, Apple is set to change the way the car industry is heading, with radical design changes. It is also rumoured that Apple will have an iCar by 2021 with a fully autonomous car planned to launch by around 2026. Of course, these are all speculations and rumours, so take the report and speculations with a pinch of salt. Supply chain rumours In August 2016, Neil Cybart, the founder of Above Avalon, an analyst firm which concentrates on Apple, mentioned on Twitter the new developments of Apple's supply chain. It is stated that Apple has recently signed an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) with a major South Korean battery developer for cylindrical lithium-ion batteries. This is a strong indication that Apple is looking into electric cars and potentially driverless cars. We will be sure to update this article if we learn of any developments in Apple's supply chain. New roles working at Apple According to the WSJ, Apple has appointed Bob Mansfield (previously Senior Vice President of Technologies at Apple) to work and oversee the Electric Vehicle Team at the company. He previously was set to retire in June 2012, but has been involved in numerous special projects at the company. This further solidifies claims that Apple is committed to releasing their very own iCar, Apple Car or Titan project. It has also been reported by appleinsider that the project is delayed until 2021, a year after its inital rollout. As with all things, take this date prediction with a pinch of salt. Money spent on R&D It has emerged that Apple has spent $10bn in research and development costs, which is more than triple of what it spent just four years ago ($3bn). This massive increase in R&D costs, does suggest that Apple is developing something a lot bigger than simply a new iPhone, iPad or Mac device. Apple's future competitors In a recent interview with the BBC, Ford boss Mark Fields claims that the future rivals of the company may not be the likes of BMW and Audi, but instead tech companies like Google and Apple. Fields went on to explain that Ford's working assumption is that Apple is indeed building a car, and that the assumption provides Ford with "the right motivation to make sure we stay very focused not only on the product but overall on the experience that the customer has interacting with the product and the services that we have." This is following the opening of a new Ford-owned technology business in Palo Alto where employees will be working on autonomous cars that can drive automatically, as well as working with IoT companies to see how people interact with their vehicles. If nothing else, it's an interesting look at what big companies like Ford expect to see on the road within the next five to ten years regardless of Apple's efforts. Apple CEO Tim Cook comments on Apple Car rumours  It takes a lot for the CEO of a company to openly discuss rumours surrounding their own upcoming products, especially when it's the CEO of a secretive company like Apple. However, as unlikely as it seems, Tim Cook has recently teased the media about the possibility of an Apple Car in the future. While he didn't directly comment on the likelihood of an Apple Car, during a recent interview with Fortune, Cook said: "we don’t have to spend large amounts to explore". Apparently, Apple becomes "committed" to a project once the company begins spending huge amounts of money on tools, company acquisitions and other processes (as rumours suggest the company has), although hiring experts don't seem to count. "We explore things with teams of people. And that’s a part of being curious," Cook said. It wasn't the last that Cook had to say about the iCar, either. Only days after speaking to Fortune, Cook teased attendees at an Apple shareholders meeting about future possibilities. "Do you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve... it was so exciting," Cook reportedly said. "You weren't sure what was going to be downstairs. Well, it's going to be Christmas Eve for a while." We'll obviously be waiting some time for an Apple-branded car, but the latest comments from the Apple CEO will definitely add fuel to the fire. 'Engine noises' heard late at night at Apple Car campus If Apple isn't developing a car, this rumour will be pretty hard to explain: AppleInsider has reported that someone who lives near Apple's mysterious campus in Sunnyvale, Calfornia (believed to be where Apple is developing its car) complained about "motor noises" coming from the facility at night.  "[Do] there have to [be] motor noises at 11:00 p.m. at night like last night? Even with the windows closed I could still hear it," the resident reportedly remarked.  However, the resident may be mistaken - construction sounds sound similar to the revving of an engine, especially at a distance. Last year, Sunnyvale issued permits to Apple allowing the company to build a "windowless repair garage" at one of the buildings Apple operates at, so it's possible that is what was heard - although why the construction would take place at night is a mystery.  It's also worth noting that if Apple is building a prototype car at the facility, the noises could be the sound of the lathes and mills required to shape the metal, a notoriously noisy process. Ford exec welcomes Apple to automotive industry The Apple Car is shrouded in mystery, with the only real information we have (if that's what you can call it) is in the form of leaks and rumours, but that hasn't stopped people from forming opinions - in fact, even car company executives are chiming in on the rumours. During an interview with TrustedReviews at CES 2016, Don Butler, Executive Director of Ford Connected Vehicles said that Ford welcomes the competition from Apple and that he thinks that techie companies including Apple and Google "can do it". “We welcome others joining. We welcome the activity that’s in the space. We think it’s exciting. It’s actually changed that we are embracing,” said Butler when discussing the automotive industry. “So I think Apple can do it. I think Google can do it.” While it's far from confirmation that Apple is creating the iCar, it goes to show that if/when Apple does enter the automotive industry, it's presence will be welcomed by the likes of Ford. From the above, it seems as if Ford believes that the likes of Apple and Google can (if they aren't already) change the automotive industry and the way we interact with cars for the better. In an interview with the BBC, Ford boss Mark Fields claims that the future rivals of the company may not be the likes of BMW and Audi, but instead tech companies like Google and Apple. Fields went on to explain that Ford's working assumption is that Apple is indeed building a car, and that the assumption provides Ford with "the right motivation to make sure we stay very focused not only on the product but overall on the experience that the customer has interacting with the product and the services that we have." This is following the opening of a new Ford-owned technology business in Palo Alto where employees will be working on autonomous cars that can drive automatically, as well as working with IoT companies to see how people interact with their vehicles. If nothing else, it's an interesting look at what big companies like Ford expect to see on the road within the next five to ten years regardless of Apple's efforts. Apple buys car-related domain names As first reported by MacRumours, it appears that Apple has bought a number of car-related domain names including apple.car, apple.cars and apple.auto. The purchases took place in December 2015 and were brought to light via Whois, a service that finds information regarding specific domain names and IP addresses. Whois records were updated on January 8 2016 to show that Apple had registered the domains through registrar MarkMonitor Inc, although it’s worth noting that none of the registered domains are currently active. While this may seem like confirmation that Apple is working on an Apple Car, it may not be the case; Apple could be buying the domains for use with Apple’s in-car system, CarPlay. It could also be to stop potential scammers looking to make money from people in light of the recent Apple Car rumours. Although with this being said, Apple bought iCloud.com months before its announcement and that was also picked up by MacRumours. Elon Musk 'confirms' existence of Apple Car in an interview As well as Apple buying car-related domain names, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk recently ‘confirmed’ the existence of Apple’s iCar when speaking to the BBC, claiming that it’s an “open secret” that the company is building a rival car. Musk went on to say that “companies like Apple will probably make a compelling electric car, it seems like the obvious thing to do” and regarding Apple’s privacy, he remarked “It's pretty hard to hide something if you hire over a thousand engineers to do it”. Although he’s fairly confident that Apple is creating a rival car, Musk isn’t worried. When asked if Apple was a threat by a German newspaper, Musk mockingly replied: “Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch?”. The cheek. New electric car company could be a ‘front’ for Apple The latest reports on the web claim that a new car manufacturer, Faraday Future, could, in fact, be a front for Apple’s rumoured electric car, allowing the company to develop the vehicle without the prying eyes of the media watching them. Faraday Future is a relatively new manufacturer, first appearing on the scene earlier this year as a Tesla competitor – both companies are named after famous scientists, Nikola Tesla and Michael Faraday, and interested in electric vehicles. Though Faraday Future’s plans were initially unclear, the company recently announced that it’d be investing a whopping $1 billion in a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in either California, Georgia, Louisiana or Nevada. The company plans to create an electric vehicle, while it also explores “other aspects of the automotive and technology industries, including unique ownership and usage models, in-vehicle content and autonomous driving”. That’s according to Nick Sampson, senior vice president of Faraday Future, who continued to say "Our range of 100% electric and intelligent vehicles will offer seamless connectivity to the outside world." Very Apple-esque, wouldn’t you agree? So, where is the connection to Apple? First things first, the company claims to have a team of around 400 “automotive and technology experts” along with a number of key employees, including ex-Tesla director of vehicle chassis engineering, Nick Sampson. This matches up with the reports earlier this year claiming that Apple was poaching a number of Tesla staff for its iCar project – but that’s not all. Apple has reportedly just bought a huge amount of land in California, which is claimed to be around twice the size of its new Spaceship campus. Just to put that into perspective, Apple’s spaceship campus and surrounding land measures in at around 2.8 million feet. Now, where did Faraday Future say they’d be investing in a manufacturing facility? Oh… The company has also received a massive $1 billion in funding – a move that’s almost unheard of for a new company, and many suspect that it’s Apple footing the bill. Apple has around $200 billion in the bank, so $1 billion would (as ridiculous as it sounds) be only a drop in the water for the company. The rumours gained more traction when the New York Times reached out for more information on its backers, with Faraday Future claiming that they are “keeping their partners confidential”. Intriguing, right? Well, there’s one more piece to this puzzle… The CEO of the company has not yet been revealed, a move that shrouds this company in mystery. If Faraday Future is a front for Apple’s iCar development, it’d make sense not to announce a CEO; pushing an Apple exec to the position of Faraday Future CEO would immediately give away the company’s plans, possibly years before the launch of its electric car. Of course, nothing has been confirmed or denied, and it does seem like a lot of effort to disguise its own efforts, but it is possible – and if it was going to be any company, it would, of course, be Apple to do it. Apple Car ‘could have digital license plates’ According to website Electrek, Apple’s upcoming iCar could be the first to boast digital license plates. Why? Amongst the horde of employees that Apple has snapped up over the past few months is Rónán Ó Braonáin, ex-Director of Engineering at Reviver, a start-up working on what Braonáin called “the world’s first digital license plate”. According to his LinkedIn, he spent five years as a software engineer at BMW before becoming CTO at Vision Fleet, a company offering electric vehicle fleet management software, before moving onto Reviver and finally ending up at Apple as a “Secret Agent” on “Special Projects”. Digital license plates make sense, especially when you consider vehicle-sharing. The digital license plate could bring forward a new era of vehicle sharing, by giving the government a way to issue plate identifications to the driver of the car, instead of the car itself. Letting a friend drive? Your iCar’s digital license plate would (in theory) automatically update, letting everyone (aka the government) know who’s driving at any particular time. It’s a cool idea, but we’re not sure just how viable it is, especially when you consider that license plates need to be readable in almost any weather conditions, an issue that a digital license plate may struggle with. Steve Jobs ‘considered Apple car’ in 2008 Tony Fadell, former Apple executive, revealed in a recent interview that he and Steve Jobs occasionally talked about what an Apple-manufactured car could look like. The pair would chat informally about various features of the Apple Car and what they’d look like, from the dashboard to the seats to the type of fuel it could be powered by. Although in his follow-up, Fadell stressed that the questions were purely hypothetical and that Apple wasn’t actively developing a car in 2008. Apple execs reportedly liked the idea of building a car, but decided, in the end, to allocate the company’s resources to other products that’d have a bigger impact on consumers around the world – the iPhone, and then three years later, the iPad. However, Fadell did note that cars and iPhones have more in common than meets the eye: “A car has batteries; it has a computer; it has a motor, and it has mechanical structure. If you look at an iPhone, it has all the same things. It even has a motor in it,”. ‘Massive change’ is coming to the auto industry Speaking at Wall Street Journal’s WSJDLive conference at The Montage resort in Laguna Beach, California, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the automotive industry is close to “massive change” but refused to comment on whether Apple would be a leading part of the change, which Cook predicts will see users move away from internal combustion engines to electrification. “It would seem like there will be massive change in that industry, massive change,” Cook said at the conference. “You may not agree with that. That’s what I think.” This was followed by Cook refusing to respond to reports of Apple developing an electric car looking to be on sale by 2019. He said instead that the company is working to bring the “iPhone experience” to the vehicle via CarPlay, Apple’s in-dash system that allows users to access their iTunes music collections and driving directions without needing to operate phones. Apple 'testing a self-driving car at a War World II naval base' Project Titan is on its way, at least according to the Guardian. The newspaper reports that Apple has already developed its self-driving car, and now it just needs to be tested. Unlike many carmakers - such as Google and Tesla - that are testing their self-driving vehicles on public roads, Apple wants to keep a low profile. That means the company needs some barricaded doors behind which it can test its secretive projects. Apparently Apple has found the perfect top-secret testing base. Back in May, according to the Guardian, Apple's engineers met officials from GoMentum Station, a War World II-epoch disused naval base near San Francisco. The base reportedly hosts 20 miles of everyday public transport scenarios, from highways to cattle grids; its 24-hour surveillance by armed soldiers prevents the public from nosing around the facility. According to GoMentum officials, the base is "the largest secure test facility in the world". However, it's worth mentioning that the leaked report obtained by the Guardian consists of a filed public requests record about the meeting between Apple's team and GoMentum officials. There is no mention of an Apple iCar, and the most revealing clue comes from Apple engineer Frank Fearon, who said: "We would … like to get an understanding of timing and availability for the space, and how we would need to coordinate with other parties who would be using [GoMentum]." BMW negotiations A number of outlets have reported that Apple and the German automaker BMW have been meeting with one another, with Reuters reporting that Tim Cook and other Apple bigwigs visited the BMW production facility in Leipzig. In particular, Apple seems interested in the carbon-fibre-reinforced BMW i3 electric vehicle, reportedly the most energy-efficient car in the US. It's believed that the i3 could form the basis of the rumoured iCar. It's further been claimed that negotiations between Apple and BMW started in autumn 2014 and are approaching a final deal. However, it's worth pointing out that BMW was the first carmaker to incorporate iPod facilities into its vehicles, and that it is entirely possible that Apple is simply looking to secure an agreement with the German company to move its CarPlay project forward. Read more: Apple and BMW started talking about an iCar collaboration last year Hiring car industry veterans Perhaps the clearest sign of Apple's interest in the car industry is the number of new hires it's made from that field. According to the Wall Street Journal, Tim Cook has hired Doug Betts, a veteran of the car industry. Doug Betts has 25 years of experience working for Nissan and Toyota; from 2007 until last year, he was senior vice-president of Global Quality at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The automobile expert has changed his LinkedIn profile. He describes his current job as "operation-Apple Inc.", which could be interpreted as evidence to back up the WSJ's rumour. On the other hand, this cryptic statement could mean a lot of things.  Since February 2015, Apple seems to have been quietly cherry-picking automobile industry experts - such as Paul Furgale, the Swiss researcher who led the V-Charge project developing self-parking cars. Business Insider's source claims that Tesla employees are "jumping ship" to go and work at Apple. Evidence via LinkedIn supports this claim, with 50 profiles of current Apple employees that have an engineering history at Tesla, mainly through internships. Apple Insider reported that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said that Apple is trying very hard to get Tesla engineers, offering them a $250k signing bonus and 60 percent pay increase. The Korea Times has reported that Apple is also luring Samsung's tech experts away from them, namely experts in battery technology; perhaps to work on batteries for the iPhone, but also, reports suggest to work on a battery powered electric car. "Some of our personnel have been hired by Apple. They now work at Apple's headquarters in San Jose, Calif.," claimed one anonymous Samsung official, stating that Apple offers competitive benefits and large annual paychecks. If Apple is entering the electric car arena, the company is pretty late to the game and will be looking to file patents. It has already filed a few, as you will see below. "As the electric vehicle business is a new one, Apple needs patents and experts in battery technology. Top human resources firms have been approaching Samsung's battery experts, individually, and I think such human exchange moves are a win-win for both," said the Samsung official. It's easy to write this off as an unconfirmed rumour, but it does fit in with a lawsuit that was filed earlier this month claiming that Apple engaged in an "aggressive campaign" to poach engineers from electric car battery maker A123 Systems. The Register has also reported that Apple is reassigning workers to its car project at such a fast pace that other department leaders are beginning to complain about the loss of talent. Though Project Titan remains shrouded in mystery, reassigning such a number of staff from a variety of departments does point towards work on a significant scale, and possibly a move into a completely new industry.  'Apple cars' spotted There were also rumours surrounding Apple registered vehicles seen driving around the US. The vehicles were clad in sensors, which some assumed enabled the car to drive autonomously like Google’s self-driving car. However, it was too good to be true as Apple announced months after that these were, in fact, mapping vehicles that were being used to improve the Apple Maps service. In fact, the company has even listed all the locations that Apple’s mapping cars will be driving around – possibly to stop any future confusion. If you’re interested (for whatever reason) in seeing Apple’s mapping vehicles in person, head over to the Apple Vehicles page and take a look. More about this rumour below. Secret iCar facility There has also been talk of a secret automobile R&D facility where Apple is recruiting experts to potentially build the iCar. It's apparently run by the ex-head of R&D at Mercedes, Johann Jungwirth, and will be staffed with "experienced managers from its iPhone unit", according to The Times. They carry on to say that the seniority of the executives involved would suggest that an iCar could be in the works. They've also reported that Jony Ive and members of his industrial design team, who are responsible for most of Apples products, have been holding regular meetings with automotive execs and have even tried hiring them. Project Titan team growing According to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal, Apple is taking the iCar project more seriously. Why? Apparently, the company has decided to triple the 600-person strong team to an 1800-person strong team to help reach the iCars all-new 2019 announcement target (see below for more information).  Head over to page 2 for evidence that Apple isn't working on an iCar, along with all rumours discussing the electric vs autonomous debate and a possible release date.  >> Read on… Pages 1 2 3 Tags: Apple , Rumour Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

If you've been seeking a hub for an IoT-connected office, it's well worth your time to investigate the Echo to see if it's a good fit, and TechRepublic has all the info you need right here. TechRepublic's smart person's guide about Amazon Echo is a quick introduction to Amazon's smart speaker, as well as a "living" guide that will be updated periodically as new software is released and new hardware is developed. SEE: Check out all of TechRepublic's smart person's guides. Executive summary What is Amazon Echo? Amazon Echo is an internet-connected smart speaker. It comes with Alexa, Amazon's digital assistant, and is able to serve as an IoT hub, a music player, an internet search engine, and anything else that a Skill enables it to do. Why does Amazon Echo matter? Echo is, so far, the leading smart speaker on the market. Google Home is a close second, but Amazon's two-year head start has made Echo and Alexa the platform to beat. Anyone interested in smart home technology will likely be making a choice between one of those platforms. Who does Amazon Echo affect? Echo affects anyone who wishes to turn their home or business into a smart IoT-connected one. Echo can serve as a hub for a variety of IoT devices, as well as serving as a digital assistant like Siri, Cortana, or Google Assistant. When is Amazon Echo happening? The Amazon Echo was released to the public in June 2015, with the Dot and Tap being released in September and March 2016, respectively. How do I start using Amazon Echo? The Echo, Echo Dot, and Echo Tap are all available on Amazon.com and at major electronics retailers. Using an Echo is as simple as installing the smartphone app and following the onscreen instructions. SEE: Cracking Open the Amazon Echo cloud-connected speaker (TechRepublic) What is Amazon Echo? It's hard to be on the internet nowadays and not have heard of the Echo. Amazon's smart speaker and IoT hub has sold over five million units since its launch in 2015, making it the easy leader in the smart speaker market. The Echo, Echo Dot, and Echo Tap are all internet-connected speakers that come with Amazon's Alexa digital assistant. Alexa can control IoT devices, purchase goods from Amazon, play music, and perform a variety of app-like tasks called Skills, which can be installed from inside the Alexa app or Amazon's Alexa Skills page. All three members of the Echo family can be woken with a voice command, which is set to "Alexa" by default. The devices each feature some limited control buttons for volume, mute, and wake, but the products truly shine when their far-field microphones and speech recognition are used to make requests from the next room.

The smart speaker/IoT hub marketplace is currently caught in a dual platform war, as is often the case in technology. This time it's Amazon vs. Google, and the latter has a lot of catching up to do. If Amazon's digital assistant supremacy—and by extension the Echo's market lead—continue, it's likely anyone getting into IoT will have to make a choice between two platforms: Amazon's and Google's. Amazon's two years of additional sales time has given it a huge edge on the number of available Skills and smart home partnerships: It greatly outpaces Google in both of those areas.

The Echo isn't just a smart home hub—it's also a digital assistant designed to do a lot of the same stuff as Siri, Cortana, and their relatives. It can set timers, add items to a shopping list, get movie reviews, book restaurant reservations, and do a lot of the stuff you used to have to find your smartphone for. Whether you want an Echo to set the thermostat, lock the doors, shut the blinds, or just keep a shopping list, it can do it.

I'm not including them here since they aren't direct competitors. Amazon Echo's main competitor is Google Home. The hardware specs for the Google Home are similar to the Echo, and functionality of the device is very similar as well. The Google Home is a bit cheaper, though: $129 versus the Echo's $179. The Dot can be purchased for $49.99, and the Tap matches the Home's $129.

Audio Challenge: when you need to enter numbers that are read out loud. Text Challenge: when you need to pick all the phrases that match a given category. Now, if Google could only figure out how to keep researchers from using its own tools to skewer those challenges. No. 1, the image challenge, was gamed about a year ago when researchers used Google’s own massive image search database in reverse, finding words to match an image, rather than images to match a word, to help them find images in a reCAPTCHA set that shared a particular characteristic. Now, the audio challenge has purportedly fallen, and yet again, it stumbled on one of Google’s own services: this time, it was Google’s speech recognition API. A security researcher identifying him-/herself only as East-Ee Security said on Monday that they’ve discovered what they’re calling a “logic vulnerability” that allows for easy bypass of Google’s ReCaptcha v2 anywhere on the web. The researcher came up with a way to automatically exploit that vulnerability. Dubbed ReBreakCaptcha, it works in these three stages: Challenge. Get to the right sort of reCAPTCH page where an audio challenge is offered, and download it. Recognize. Convert the audio file to a suitable format and send it to Google’s Speech Recognition API. Verify. Validate the Speech Recognition result and paste it into the reCAPTCHA, as though a human had figured it out. East-Ee Security posted proof-of-concept code on GitHub. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More In order to work, ReBreakCaptcha needs to make sure it gets an audio challenge every time, since that’s the type of challenge it knows how to game. It’s able to do that because when you’re presented with a text challenge, the dialog box offers a “reload” button. ReBreakCaptcha just keeps clicking that Reload Challenge button until it gets the audio challenge. Likewise, when presented with an image challenge, ReBreakCaptcha selects the microphone icon at the bottom of the dialog box to select an audio challenge instead. The controls on the audio challenge page are to play the audio, type in the answer, or download the audio challenge as a file. The download button comes in handy. ReBreakCaptcha downloads the audio, converts it to WAV format (as Google’s Speech Recognition API requires), then feeds it into Google’s Speech Recognition. What the service sends back is a string: perfect for copying and pasting into the audio challenge’s text input box. All these steps are automated through a Python script that relies on a library named SpeechRecognition that has support for several engines and APIs, online and offline. The point of reCAPTCHA challenges is to slow down bots (software robots), so a bot that can solve a CAPTCHA automatically defeats the whole object. The reason to determine if somebody’s human or bot is that bots do nefarious things, and they never get bored or tired when they’re doing them. For example, bots harvest email addresses from contact or guestbook pages, scrape sites and reuse the content without permission on automatically generated doorway pages, take part in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and automatically try to log into sites with reused passwords ripped off from breaches. Of course, we saw reCAPTCHA fooled when researchers got around the image challenge with a success rate of 70% last April. As it happens, Google’s been working on an even spiffier reCAPTCHA version, called Invisible reCAPTCHA, that won’t require us to click on anything at all. Rather, it will use advanced risk analysis technology that relies on clues as subtle as how a user (or a bot) moves the mouse in the brief moments before clicking the “I am not a robot” button to determine who’s human and who’s a bot. But for now, while we wait for reCAPTCHA version 3 to come out, there’s apparently one more way to break version 2. East-Ee Security said that at the time the vulnerability was posted, the vulnerability hadn’t yet been patched. The researcher didn’t mention whether s/he’d reported the bug to Google. I reached out to ask that of Google and to find out the status of a fix, and I’ll update the article if I hear back.

Osterloh shot down reports calling for a budget Pixel edition, saying Pixels remain premium smartphones. While Google showed no intent to abandon its premium smartphone brand, the company’s premium notebook bearing the Pixel brand has reached the “end of the line” status after shipping just two generations since 2013, according to Osterloh in a report by Frederic Lardinois for TechCrunch. Google Pixel 2 due later this year As per various leaks, the upcoming Pixel 2 smartphones may ship with a five-inch display running at 2K resolution, augmented by a new chipset from Qualcomm (possibly even Intel?) with six gigabytes of RAM to support Google’s second-generation virtual reality platform, dubbed Daydream. Other rumored features include a USB-C port at the bottom, standard 3.5mm audio jack on the top and a new design involving a glass back panel with chamfered edges, center-aligned camera module and a fingerprint sensor. Pixel 2 renders leaked via Chinese website Anzhuo. “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it,” said Osterloh. Contrary to past rumors, Google has no intentions of launching a budget Pixel edition as Osterloh confirms that next-generation Pixel smartphones will stick to their premium segment branding. He wouldn’t say whether Google partnered with a third-party vendor on the next Pixel. Water resistance, a feature missing from the original Pixel, should be added to a second-gen Pixel if Google is serious about keeping up with its high-end competition. Chromebook Pixel reaches the end of the line While the Pixel smartphone project wasn’t just a one-off experiment, Google’s Pixel notebooks will no longer be updated as the company has “no plans” to create future Pixel-branded notebooks. That piece of information was confirmed to TechCrunch’s Frederic Lardinois by Osterloh himself so it’s official. Furthermore, Pixel notebooks that are already out in the market have totally sold out and Google has no plans to make any more of these, either, and they have been removed from sale from Google’s online store, too. Priced at $1,299, Pixel was always meant to be Google’s example of what a premium Chromebook could look like. Outfitted with a touchscreen, Pixel notebooks ran Chrome OS. A source told CNET that while there won’t be any more Pixel notebooks, it doesn’t mean Google “isn’t still interested in branded laptops and or convertibles.” Osterloh clarified to CNET that “we don’t have any plans to discuss at this time.” For the sake of completeness, I should mention that Google is thought to be folding Chrome OS and Android together into a new version of Chrome OS this year. It should be able to host Android apps, in addition to web apps running in the Chrome browser, and will allegedly run on PCs and give users access to Google’s Play Store. FYI, Google’s Android-driven Pixel C tablet is still around. Chrome OS gaining share in US K-12 Still, Osterloh said, “Google hasn’t backed away from laptops” entirely as Chrome OS remains “a huge initiative” in the company. Indeed, new data from Futuresource Consulting, as cited in The New York Times, showed that Apple’s iOS and macOS platforms both lost share to Chrome OS in the US K-12 education market last year. Chrome OS is a version of Linux running the Chrome web browser. While US K-12 shipments overall grew 18 percent annually to 12.6 million units, Apple’s iOS platform share in that sector dropped from nineteen percent in 2015 to fourteen percent in 2016. During the same period, macOS went from six to five percent share. As for Chrome OS, the platform grew from fifty percent market share in 2015 to 58 percent in 2016. “We have the number two market share in the U.S. and U.K—but we have no plans for Google-branded laptops,” Osterloh said. Apple has taken a beating mainly because Chrome OS notebooks are far cheaper than iPads or Macs. A typical Chromebook sells for under $300, with prices reaching as low as $120 on certain educational projects.

Apple also lacks 2-in-1 products that combine the defining features of the notebook and the tablet. Both Microsoft and Google and their respective partners have announced a wide range of 2-in-1 products designed specifically for education, priced below $300.

By Matt McFarland WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) -- Google, which not along ago was using artificial intelligence to identify cat pictures, has moved onto something bigger -- breast cancer. Google announced Friday that it has achieved state-of-the-art results in using artificial intelligence to identify breast cancer. The findings are a reminder of the rapid advances in artificial intelligence, and its potential to improve global health. Google used a flavor of artificial intelligence called deep learning to analyze thousands of slides of cancer cells provided by a Dutch university. Deep learning is where computers are taught to recognize patterns in huge data sets. It's very useful for visual tasks, such as looking at a breast cancer biopsy. With 230,000 new cases of breast cancer every year in the United States, Google hopes its technology will help pathologists better treat patients. The technology isn't designed to, or capable of, replacing human doctors. "What we've trained is just a little sliver of software that helps with one part of a very complex series of tasks," said Lily Peng, the project manager behind Google's work. "There will hopefully be more and more of these tools that help doctors [who] have to go through an enormous amount of information all the time." Peng described to CNNTech how the human and the computer could work together to create better outcomes. Google's artificial intelligence system excels at being very sensitive to potential cancer. It will flag things a human will miss. But it sometimes will falsely identify something as cancer, whereas a human pathologist is better at saying, "no, this isn't cancer." "Imagine combining these two types of super powers," Peng said. "The algorithm helps you localize and find these tumors. And the doctor is really good at saying, 'This is not cancer.'" For now, Google's progress is still research mode and remains in the lab. Google isn't going to become your pathologist's assistant tomorrow. But Google and many other players are striving toward a future where that becomes a reality. Jeroen van der Laak, who leads the pathology department at Radboud University Medical Center, believes the first algorithms for cancer will be available within a couple years, and large-scale routine use will occur in about five years. His university provided the slides for Google's research. The technology will be especially useful in parts of the world where there's a shortage of physicians. For patients who don't have access to a pathologist, an algorithm -- even if imperfect -- would be a meaningful improvement. Van der Laak highlighted India and China as two underserved areas.

By Michael Moore PUBLISHED: 14:25, Fri, Mar 3, 2017 | UPDATED: 14:39, Fri, Mar 3, 2017 GOOGLEWhat does Google have in store for the Pixel 2? Google is hard at work on its next great smartphone. The company is set to reveal the Google Pixel 2 later this year, according to a senior Google executive. The announcement is also good news for phone fans looking for that something a little special, as the Google Pixel 2 will remain a “premium” device. Google Pixel – In Pictures Thu, October 20, 2016 The Google Pixel and larger Pixel XL both feature stunning screens, fast processors, top-notch cameras and a ridiculously high price tag Play slideshow EXPRESS NEWSPAPERS 1 of 18 Google’s Pixel smartphone boasts a stunning screen, fast processor, top-notch camera and a ridiculously high price-tag News of the Google Pixel 2 was revealed by the company’s SVP of hardware, Rick Osterloh, at a press event at Mobile World Congress earlier this week. “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it,” Osterloh said according to AndroidPit.  He added that a new Google Pixel device will be released later this year, saying, “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” Related articles Google Pixel audio problem - this new patch should SOLVE your problems Android 7.0 Nougat download - when will my smartphone get it? The Google Pixel and Pixel XL devices were released last October, marking Google’s latest move into the smartphone hardware market. It stands to reason that the Google Pixel 2 will keep to this schedule, with a release later this year. The new device should be the first to run Google’s new Android 8.0 Oreo, which is heavily rumoured to be the new version of the company’s mobile software. With the company’s Google I/O event in May expected to give a first look at the next version of Android, it may be we get our first glimpse of the Google Pixel 2 then as well. Rumours of the Google Pixel 2 first emerged earlier this year. The device is expected to feature a number of hardware improvements on the first-generation device, including a more powerful processor and more memory and storage. Google is apparently carrying out several tests at the moment with different processors, including the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon chips as well as specialised Intel hardware. EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSThe Google Pixel is one of the most powerful Android devices on the market today Reports claimed that the Google Pixel 2 will feature a waterproof design for the first time. Google reportedly did not introduce this feature to the original Pixel device due to time constraints and the high cost of implementing into the design. Reports have also claimed that the Pixel 2’s camera is set for a huge upgrade, with Google reportedly looking at a sensor that will allow the device to excel at low-light photography. The initial Pixel device featured a 12.3MP primary camera, which put it below the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S7 or Sony’s Xperia phones in terms of pure megapixels, but did include a number of clever tools that won it many plaudits. EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSExpress.co.uk was a big fan of the original Google Pixel smartphone In keeping with past strategy, Google may be set for multiple releases, with the company reportedly planning to release more than one Pixel 2 device. One of the biggest criticisms levelled at the original Pixel phone was its high price, as the device still currently costs on sale for an eye-watering £529. However reports have claimed that the Google Pixel 2 will come with a more budget-friendly companion in an attempt to broaden its appeal and boost sales. The “Pixel 2B” will cost less than the main device, but will likely feature less powerful hardware.  Related articles Gmail just got a HUGE new update that is good news for email fans Your Android 7.0 Nougat phone is about to get a HUGE upgrade Google Chrome just rolled-out its most useful feature yet, but not ...

The two smartphones are quite special, especially since they represent Google’s vision of a perfect Android powered device. What makes them so special is the fact that they are equipped with impressive hardware performances and Pixel exclusive features. The reason we’re talking about them today is because one of those exclusive features is getting passed on to Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. Nexus 5X Receives Fingerprint Gestures Support A couple of weeks ago Google rolled out Android 7.1.2 Nougat developer preview to all Pixel, Pixel XL and Nexus 5X owners who are registered in the Android Beta Program. This operating system update is being regarded as only a maintenance update, but it includes something more. Nexus 5X owners should be happy to know that this update brings them fingerprint gestures support. Will Nexus 6P Receive Fingerprint Gestures Support? Nexus 6P owners have recently started receiving Android 7.1.2 Nougat developer preview. Sadly, the said feature didn’t come along. Even though Google has yet to confirm why fingerprint gestures support hasn’t been included, everyone is speculating that Google is still working on optimizing it for Nexus 6P. We can be sure that when the public version of Android 7.1.2 Nougat is launched, it will include fingerprint gestures support for Nexus 6P. Fingerprint Gestures Support This isn’t a life changing feature, it’s more of a user experience enhancement. What it basically does is that it allows Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P owners to open up their notifications panel by simply swiping their finger over the fingerprint sensor. This feature comes in quite handy especially to Nexus 6P owners because the smartphone is pretty big. Nonetheless, it’s great seeing that Google didn’t completely forget about its Nexus lineup. Even though the whole tech community is speculating that Google is trying to slowly but surely kill off the Nexus brand in favor of the newer Pixel brand, the Android parent proved that this isn’t the case. Although, in the future Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P might not be kept up to par with Pixel and Pixel XL when it comes to features.

Motorola used to be the company that Google chose to partner with when it came to designing new Nexus smartphones. This ended when LG came along and took Motorola’s place. Now Google and Motorola started competing against each other on the smartphone market. Back in 2015 Google and LG launched Nexus 5X while Motorola launched Moto X Style. The two smartphones have been fighting with each other ever since. Today we’re going to make it clear once and for all which one is better from a hardware performances point of view. Google Nexus 5X vs Motorola Moto X Style: Hardware Performance Motorola’s smartphone is fueled by a high-end Qualcomm hexa-core Snapdragon 808 chipset. The processor has four cores which clock at 1.4GHz and two other ones which clock at 1.8GHz. Additionally, Motorola has coupled the processor with an Adreno 418 graphics processing unit and 3GB of RAM. These hardware parts are more than capable of putting up great hardware performances. Even better, the smartphone features a quite large non-removable 3,000 mAh battery. This battery has been optimized so that its able to charge fast and last for long hours even under heavy usage. Regarding storage space, Moto X Style ships in the following variants 16GB, 32GB and 64GB. The storage space can also be expanded up to 256GB via microSD. On the other hand, LG who is the manufacturer behind Nexus 5X decided to equip the smartphone with the same hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor and an Adreno 418 graphics processing unit. There’s a difference though. The processor has been paired with only 2GB of RAM. The small amount of RAM affects the smartphone’s performances significantly. The battery used by Nexus 5X is also quite small in comparison with Moto X Style’s battery. The smartphone is powered by a non-removable Li-Po 2,700 mAh battery. Even though it’s able of lasting for hours on end, it pales in comparison with Moto X Style’s battery. Google Nexus 5X vs Motorola Moto X Style: Verdict We think it’s safe to say that Google has made a bad decision when it chose LG over Motorola. It looks like Motorola saw this as an opportunity to show that it’s able of shaking up the smartphone industry by its own and that it doesn’t need to be accompanied by Google.

Our Smart Homes are coming closer and closer and at a quick pace and results have been pretty promising as more and more tech manufacturers are entering this niche sector with amazing devices. The Google Home comes with some amazing features and its virtual assistant is beyond amazing as it is basically a real-world search tool as well as a media centre and controller, the three intertwined into a single convenient unit. The Google Home is the perfect response to Amazon Alexa and the AI-powered assistant will be sure to mop the floor with it as it has access to Google’s broad database in order to come with interesting search features and abilities to keep a schedule and reminders. Google Home is able to answer questions in depth in terms of being extremely insightful about complex topics. It can apply information which is offered through Google’s apps and make suggestions based on search patterns and commands which were prior given to it. Its Google assistant is based on a cloud system and is basically a voice assistant such as Cortana and Siri. It has been specifically designed for domestic use and the unit’s design is sleek and modern thus can be placed in pretty much any place in a household. The device looks pretty much like a jug and is believed to be highly customizable in terms of colors and finishes which range from full-metal to a soft fabric surrounding it. One will be able to use the Google Home similar how the Google Now works and will be able to allow its user to play music and stream video playback on other devices which are linked to it, features which have been previously encountered on Google Cast protocol which was issued at the same time with Chromecast. There are a lot of amazing features to take into account and judging by its absurdly low price tag of about $179.99 dollars, it is a bargain to be had when considering what amazing things it can do. One is strongly advised to purchase the device in order to have their lives more organized and entertained.

Credit: Apple More like this Apple’s Siri has a huge language advantage Apple is teaching Siri to learn new tricks Everything is a virtual assistant now Video Mingis on Tech: Self-driving cars, wireless charging -- and Wi-Fi lightbulbs? Google isn’t saying it will and Apple’s iOS developer guidelines say it can’t, but a senior Googler set the cat among the pigeons when he suggested the company would like to put its Assistant tech on iPhones. Fanning the flames It’s a rumor. Google product management director Gummi Hafsteinsson told Geekster, “I do not think we have anything to announce at this point, but I think the general philosophy is that we would like to have the Assistant available to as many people as possible." He was speaking at Mobile World Congress. It would not be possible for Google to make its Assistant tech available through an iOS app under Apple’s existing App Store rules. In part this is because Apple already offers its own system-level voice assistant, Siri; it is also because Google would need to secure permission to transmit your personal data as it sends your spoken question to its servers to get you a response. Google could introduce Google Assistant as a Web service, in which case iOS users could access it using a browser. Web search is heading in this direction: Korean search engine, Naver, recently made a strategic investment in SoundHound, for example. Contextual search Google Assistant supports sophisticated, context-based search. This means you can ask it a question such as “what movies are on at the local cinemas”, it will provide an answer, and you can then contextualise the search, for example by asking to limit the list to films on show in the area that feature a specific actor or director. The capacity for more intelligent spoken search is at present an advantage to Assistant. Google Assistant is now being extended to more Android devices, but is far from universal. Apple’s Siri isn’t as good at this – you must ask it a completely different search question and you cannot contexualize within the results. I do think Apple is working on this, as you can contextualize some searches when you use an Apple TV (“show me movies”, “just the good ones”). Siri also enjoys the huge advantage of being available across 90 percent of all iOS devices and useful to five times as many people as Assistant. (It’s also less sexist). A.I. smackdown Voice assistants started as a nice to have but are becoming a must have. Huawei, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung and others all have one. Competition in the space is intense, and Google now knows it needs to fight to maintain a good share in the industry, particularly as key Android vendors (such as Samsung) deploy their own voice A.I., rather than Google’s. Another big player in voice, Amazon, is also staking space in mobile: Alexa will be on the Android-powered Huawei Mate 9 smartphone. Google sees smart assistants as “part of an ongoing conversation with users,” Google CEO, Sundar Pichai said this week. Within this it cannot ignore that the fragmented Android ecosystem and intense competition in this space is an existential threat for the search engine giant as consumers diversify the services they use for search. Apple’s turn We know Apple has been investing deeply in A.I. R&D at offices across the planet. We also expect significant improvements to Siri this June at WWDC. This means that in order to keep pace, Google must ensure its solution is not only better than the current iteration of Siri, Cortana, Alexa, et al., but that it is better than the versions that are to come. That’s going to be pretty hard to achieve when most of the global population speaks a different language, and Apple keeps its cards so close to its chest.

Google announced Friday that it has achieved state-of-the-art results in using artificial intelligence to identify breast cancer. The findings are a reminder of the rapid advances in artificial intelligence, and its potential to improve global health. Google used a flavor of artificial intelligence called deep learning to analyze thousands of slides of cancer cells provided by a Dutch university. Deep learning is where computers are taught to recognize patterns in huge data sets. It’s very useful for visual tasks, such as looking at a breast cancer biopsy. With 230,000 new cases of breast cancer every year in the United States, Google hopes its technology will help pathologists better treat patients. The technology isn’t designed to, or capable of, replacing human doctors. “What we’ve trained is just a little sliver of software that helps with one part of a very complex series of tasks,” said Lily Peng, the project manager behind Google’s work. “There will hopefully be more and more of these tools that help doctors [who] have to go through an enormous amount of information all the time.” Peng described to CNNTech how the human and the computer could work together to create better outcomes. Google’s artificial intelligence system excels at being very sensitive to potential cancer. It will flag things a human will miss. But it sometimes will falsely identify something as cancer, whereas a human pathologist is better at saying, “no, this isn’t cancer.” “Imagine combining these two types of super powers,” Peng said. “The algorithm helps you localize and find these tumors. And the doctor is really good at saying, ‘This is not cancer.'” For now, Google’s progress is still research mode and remains in the lab. Google isn’t going to become your pathologist’s assistant tomorrow. But Google and many other players are striving toward a future where that becomes a reality. Jeroen van der Laak, who leads the pathology department at Radboud University Medical Center, believes the first algorithms for cancer will be available within a couple years, and large-scale routine use will occur in about five years. His university provided the slides for Google’s research. The technology will be especially useful in parts of the world where there’s a shortage of physicians. For patients who don’t have access to a pathologist, an algorithm — even if imperfect — would be a meaningful improvement. Van der Laak highlighted India and China as two underserved areas.

The phone itself is nothing special, but the pictures I take with it are a whole new level of awesome that I’ve never previously experienced with any mobile device. So spending the week at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and exploring a whole fresh wave of Android smartphones, the only thing I could think was "if only this thing had the Pixel’s camera." Oppo, for example, has a gorgeous red R9s limited edition that I would gladly lust after if I knew its camera were as good as Google Pixel’s. Huawei’s P10 is a very nicely designed phone, but I have my doubts it has the best mobile camera around. And LG’s G6 is practically the blueprint for what I desire from an ideal smartphone, which is why I’m afraid to even try its camera, lest it reveals itself to be less awesome than the Pixel’s. But here’s the thing: they all could have the same class of camera inside them. All it would take is Google giving away its camera algorithms in the same way that it gives away the core of Android for device manufacturers to build on top of. I’m not saying this is a good idea, but it sure is a cool one I’m not saying this is a commercially advisable idea for Google. It probably isn’t, given that the Pixel’s camera is the big differentiator on which the Mountain View company is seeking to build its own line of devices. But would it be a cool thing to happen? Absolutely! I imagine myself walking through an alternate-reality Mobile World Congress where every Android handset has an assured level of software and camera quality. Then I could give in to my most base instincts and just pick the prettiest one among them and make it my next smartphone. And, seriously, there are some beautiful phones on display these days. The Noa smartphones, from a small Croatian company making its MWC debut, looked good with zero side bezels and a particularly beautiful red option (yes, okay, I’m partial to red). Here’s my understanding of the magic behind the Google Pixel’s camera: it relies on the traditional necessities of a good sensor and optics and is helped by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor. But it is most critically reliant on Google’s ingenious mathematicians who’ve worked out an excellent always-on HDR mode and new ways to reduce image noise that others have yet to match. The sensor, from Sony, is an off-the-shelf part that BlackBerry is using in its just-announced KeyOne handset. Ditto the Pixel’s Snapdragon 821 processor — everyone has access to it and the optimizations that Google and Qualcomm worked on together. So the only missing component is Google’s software. Everyone can assemble the physical parts of the Pixel’s camera, but the key is Google’s software Google has always argued that it wants to do its best to support the Android ecosystem. It has presented itself as the partner and supporter of every Android manufacturer. But as of today, Google is undermining MWC debutants simply by having the best mobile camera tech all to itself. Granted, the Pixel’s distribution and marketing still leave it as a niche device for now, but it’s acting essentially like an iPhone — dampening enthusiasm for the newest and shiniest Android phones by virtue of its superior technology. If Google absolutely wants to see Android triumph over Apple’s iPhone and iOS, it wouldn’t be that crazy to just give away its camera software and make sure that all Android devices, at least at the premium tier, benefit from a consistently excellent camera. Sure, there’ll always be room for Google’s hardware partners to ignore or spoil its work, but on the whole, I think they are rational enough to just deploy the same algorithms as Google’s and reap the benefits of having superior tech. What if we woke up one day and practically every Android phone had a better camera than the iPhone? Now, I’m conscious that Android OEM execs are probably shaking their heads bitterly at this point, thinking they need to be different in order to stand out. But being different from the Pixel is precisely what’s stopping me from spending any money on their devices right now. There’s one king of the Android realm, one device (in two sizes) that guarantees the best long-term software and most awesome photos today. Google could choose to spread the wealth and make the mobile world exponentially more interesting. Or it could — as it’s quite entitled to do — keep building its Pixel line on the strength of its superb image processing. All I’m saying is that from the consumer’s perspective, and for those of us looking for a more thrilling and dynamic tech business, Google giving away its camera software would be the most fun and exciting change we’ve seen in a long time.

Talking to AndroidPit, Osterloh is quoted as saying: "There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it … You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now." We'd expect the Google Pixel 2 to fall into that annual refresh cycle as the Nexus did before it, so it's probably to expect the Google Pixel 2 launch to fall into October or November 2017. Those hoping for a return to the affordable Nexus days may be disappointed, as continuing with the Pixel 2 tease, Osterloh confirmed that it will stay in a premium position, reportedly saying that the cheaper segment will be left to other manufacturers. It's hardly the biggest reveal about future Pixel devices and doesn’t really tell us anything we hadn't all assumed, but it's a good starting point for the future Android phone.  As for the design, hardware, or new features, we'll have to see what unfolds over the next 6 months.

After all, it’s a home hub, and many homes tend to have multiple people. Thankfully, we may be close to seeing it. The latest version of the Google Home app shows evidence that multi-user functionality is coming. We’re not exactly sure how deep the functionality will be, but some early strings recovered from the APK show evidence that Google is readying a voice recognition feature to potentially know which user is issuing commands. It could also be that the strings — which pertain to “training” your Google Home to recognize a voice — are referring to a system for preventing TV, radios, and other noises from falsely triggering your Google Home. Even if multi-user support only goes as far as issuing an OK Google command to manually switch between profiles, it’ll be better than nothing and we hope it won’t take long for Google to deliver it.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | March 3, 2017 -- 14:00 GMT (06:00 PST) | Topic: Cloud Google is collaborating with the online education company Coursera to train more workers for the growing cloud computing industry. special feature Integrating the Hybrid Cloud As far and fast as cloud computing is embedding itself into the enterprise, there remain many cloud-resistant applications and services. Read More The companies on Friday announced the launch of a series of on-demand Google Cloud Platform training courses, developed and taught by "Google experts," according to Louise Byrne, head of Cloud Training Delivery for Google Cloud. The courses, available for a range of skill levels from beginner to advanced, will tackle topics including cloud fundamentals, operations, security, data analytics, and machine learning. On Friday Coursera launched the first course in the Data Engineering on Google Cloud Specialization -- "Big Data and Machine Learning." The shortage of workers with cloud skills has been a problem for businesses: In November, Cloud Foundry published its Global Perception Study, which found that all of the nearly 900 executives surveyed are having trouble finding IT employees who understand the cloud. Similarly, a report from RightScale showed that a lack of resources and expertise was the biggest cloud challenge for companies in 2016. With 24 million users on Coursera, the educational platform gives Google a way to reach a large pool of potential talent. Google has taken other steps to help cultivate a workforce with cloud skills -- in November, the company announced it acquired Qwiklabs, a startup that offers lab-learning environments for cloud platforms and infrastructure software vendors.

Name: Subject: Message: Gboard beta update adds Google Translate integration, improved theme selector, and more Newsby Mitja Rutnik4 days ago 9 632 13 Google recently launched a beta testing program for its popular Gboard keyboard. Those who have signed up already will have just received access to the first beta version (6.1) of the app, which offers a few new functions. You’ll now find a Google Translate icon on the keyboard which, as you can probably guess, will translate your text into a language of your choice. When you tap the icon, a text box appears on the keyboard and, as soon as you start writing, the text is automatically translated. This could save some time as you would otherwise need to open up a separate translation app or use the slightly more convoluted “Tap to Translate” feature of Google Translate. See also: New Swype Keyboard update brings emoji predictions and more January 27, 2017 The update also brings a new theme selector to Gboard, which allows you to customize the app’s appearance. It divides solid color themes, recently used themes, and the new Landscapes section into separate rows. Further, Gboard now offers a small library of suggestions, supports an additional language (Bashkir), and can predict emojis. If you’re interested in trying out the new features, you must first sign up for the beta testing program. To do so, simply visit the Google Play Store by clicking the button below.

In an interview at Mobile World Congress, Gummi Hafsteinsson — product management director at Google — said it wants to port Google’s virtual assistant to competing smartphones according to a report from Geekster. “I do not think we have anything to announce at this point,” Hafsteinsson said. “But I think the general philosophy is that we would like to have the Assistant available to as many people as possible.” Hafsteinsson’s statement followed Google confirming that Google Assistant would be available on Android TV and Android Auto platforms. The competitor to Apple’s Siri is the successor to Google Now and is starting to roll out to more Google devices. Previously, the assistant had exclusively appeared on Google’s Pixel line of premium smartphones. As Business Insider notes, it’s unlikely that Google Assistant could be fully integrated into other smartphones. Out of the box, Apple builds Siri right into its iPhones and the virtual assistant is the default option for iOS users. More likely, Google could offer Google Assistant as a separate app through a phone’s app store. Google’s Assistant is the latest entry into an increasingly competitive smartphone virtual assistant market. In order to separate themselves from competing manufacturers, companies like Samsung and LG have developed their own virtual assistants to use on their smartphones. These virtual assistants are counterparts to home assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, which are designed to help with tasks around the house like music listening and purchases.

PHOTO: REUTERS How often has it happened that you try sending an attachment to a Gmail ID and it bounces back because the attachment’s size was too big to be received by the addressee. However, that is changing as Google, which has quite heavy-handed regarding attachment sizes, has finally decided to open up a bit and increase the cap of incoming messages. This new Gmail hack even has the most tech savvy falling for it Google announced that it has increased the size of attachments you can receive through Gmail, with the maximum size raised from 25MB to 50MB. While recognising that “sending and receiving attachments is an important part of email exchanges,” Google on its official blog announced that users will now be able to receive emails of up to 50MB directly. Slack and Google are now partners at work However, Google is still very much wedded to the idea of people using Google Drive as the sending mails remain capped at the same limit as before at 25MB. Still, Google’s decision to increase the receiving limit is a good omen and hopefully rules will be further relaxed in the future.

Source: Line Corp. Mobile World Congress, the premier wireless-technology conference in Barcelona, was supposed to be a coming out party for Google's digital assistant. But at this year's proceedings, the artificially intelligent voice-based service struggled to be heard above the din of an army of rival assistants that will soon jostle for attention on smartphones. As the event kicked off Sunday, the search giant announced the Google Assistant would ship on all new phones running its popular Android operating system. The same day, Motorola said its latest Android phones would come with Amazon.com Inc.'s Alexa voice-based helper, Google's nemesis. Executives at Motorola parent Lenovo Group Ltd. explained later that consumers who buy the latest Motorola phones can use both Alexa and Google's assistant. Soon, they'll even have a third option: the Chinese manufacturer plans to roll out its own AI-powered service on its devices this year. "I don't really believe in the supremacy of one assistant," Lenovo Vice President of Product Dan Dery said in an interview, describing the plan as "bringing AI to hardware." Google's version represents one of the company's biggest bets since it began building a novel web search engine in 1998. It wants to remain the main source of digital information as people talk to their computers more, rather than type. That will require its assistant to be on as many gadgets as possible. But Google's hardware partners are also betting voice-based computing could be the next big thing, rivaling the mobile boom. VoiceLabs estimates 24.5 million voice-based devices will ship this year in the U.S., up from 6.5 million in 2016. Amazon leads, while Google is trying to catch up quickly. There's also a rush to deploy AI techniques, resulting in a Mobile World Congress awash in digital helpers. South Korea's SK Telecom Co. displayed "Nugu," an internet-connected speaker akin to Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo. Line Corp. introduced "Clova." Deutsche Telekom AG had "Tinka," a customer service chat bot.  Last month, HTC Corp. introduced Sense Companion, a personal companion service with voice-recognition, on its newest Android phone. Even Will.i.am, a hip hop star-turned-tech-entrepreneur, is working on an assistant. When a reporter asked for a demonstration at the conference, the service struggled to follow commands.  Aside from Apple Inc., smartphone makers have largely failed to wring profit from software-based services and lessen their dependence on hardware businesses beset by shrinking margins. Samsung Electronics Co. built its own mobile operating system, with little success, and Samsung Pay vies for mobile purchases with Google's Android Pay on many smartphones. Samsung is trying again with assistants. In the fall, it acquired Viv Labs, a startup formed by the creators of Apple's Siri assistant, and is expected to release a digital helper with its newest phone in March. Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer denied these efforts undercut Google's assistant. "A lot of [original equipment manufacturers] will choose to do that because they see value in assistants," he said in Barcelona. "Competition is good."  Privately, other Google employees said they are less concerned that hardware or telecom companies will build a better digital assistant. Google's search engine provides ready answers to millions of questions for its voice-based service, and the company has thousands of skilled engineers working on the project -- resources that these other firms may struggle to match. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up A larger concern is Amazon. The e-commerce giant has built a network of software development partners for Alexa, a service that, like Amazon's flagship online shopping service, could dent Google's core business of finding and delivering information. If Alexa is on a lot of Android phones, alongside the Google Assistant, which service will answer when people ask their devices valuable questions like which nearby restaurant to book or what holiday gifts to buy? In January, Amazon announced it was bringing the service to Huawei Technologies Inc. phones sold outside of China. Then came Lenovo at MWC. The story of the Chinese company's Motorola division is a painfully familiar tale for anyone involved in Android. While it's the most popular software for running phones, Android manufacturers have struggled to make money on hardware, while Google scoops up billions of dollars from mobile services and related ads flowing through the devices.  Lenovo bought the Motorola hardware business from Google in 2014 and the integration has been tough: in the third quarter, Lenovo reported a $112 million loss from its mobile division, compared with $30 million a year earlier. Dery, a former Motorola Vice President who returned to the brand in July, is tasked with breathing new life into the business.  Digital assistants are key to his plan. Lenovo's coming voice-based service will rely on a personal identifier attached to all users of its hardware, allowing it to work consistently across Lenovo phones, tablets, desktop and laptop computers, said Dery. Dery described this as a supplement to the assistants from Amazon and Google. While those two services mostly respond to queries and commands, Lenovo's will send notifications and alerts based on predictions about users' behavior and needs, according to the executive. "We don't like to call it an assistant because it's misleading in a way," he said. "This is something which is always aware, in the background, syncing for you."  By Dery's telling, Amazon was quite pleased to hear about his broader AI strategy. "We shared that whole plan with Amazon and they realized, 'Wow, this is exactly the missing piece for putting Alexa in everyone's pocket,'" he said. Google wasn't upset by the move either, he insisted. "They know our plan as well," Dery said. Still, the more digital assistants get crammed into devices, the more crowding for Google. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Then, to make things even better, Google goes and adds new features that I didn’t even know I needed. Now, the company has revealed in a blog post that the service will be picking up a new editing feature ─ auto white balance. Auto white balance is a simple feature, but should come in handy from time to time. The basic concept is to adjust the tone of the white in an image, allowing things to look a bit more natural and in some cases, make colors pop. This also rounds out Google’s auto-adjustment portfolio, as the service can now auto-adjust white balance, exposure, saturation, and contrast. Google will start rolling the feature out this week to users on Android and on the web, and will continue the rollout to iOS “soon.” Expect an Android update in the coming days. You can get an idea of what sort of effect this will have in photos in Google’s demo below.

The bad news is that Google has nothing to announce yet, but the good news is that Google isn’t closed to the idea and might have hinted at its arrival on iOS, or at least that’s according to a report from Geekster (via AppleInsider). The report quotes Google product management director Gummi Hafsteinsson who spoke at MWC 2017 this week where he said, “I do not think we have anything to announce at this point. But I think the general philosophy is that we would like to have the Assistant available to as many people as possible.” Given that pretty much most of Google’s Android apps have eventually ended up on iOS (even Google Now which existed within the Google Search app for iOS), we guess it wouldn’t be a stretch of the imagination to think that Google Assistant could arrive as well. As to when that will be happening, we guess this is something we’ll just have to wait and find out for ourselves. In the meantime how does the idea of Google Assistant arriving on iOS sound to you guys? Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about ai, Apps, Google, google assistant and iOS.

Apple has Siri, Google has Google Assistant, Amazon has Alexa, Microsoft has Cortana, Samsung reportedly has Bixby, SoundCloud has Hound, and now LINE appears to be getting its own as well. In a report from the Financial Times (paywall; via Engadget), messaging app LINE has announced that they will be launching their own digital assistant called Clova. For those unfamiliar, LINE is a messaging app that seems to be pretty popular in Asia, so if you haven’t heard of it don’t worry too much about it. At the moment there is no clear date on when Clova will be launched, but LINE is expecting that it should be released this coming summer. The platform is being developed with help from the likes of Sony and LG, who interestingly enough are two companies that do not have their own digital assistant platforms. It will be capable of doing what most digital assistant platforms can do, such as accessing the news, weather, calendars, online purchases, “complicated questions”, and apparently even facial recognition. As to availability, Clova will be open to third-party apps and hardware, and will be initially released as a standalone app and integrated into a smart speaker system called “Wave”. We have to wonder with input from both Sony and LG, could it be possible that we might see Clova find their way into future Sony and LG devices as well? We guess we’ll have to wait and see.

Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, Google’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager, Anglophone West Africa, said in a statement in Lagos that the search was from February 23 to March 1. Kola-Ogunlade said: “Relationship between Nigeria and South Africa became slightly strained this week, when allegations of xenophobic attacks against Nigerians in South Africa ruled the internet.” The Google manager said that people’s attention was also caught online by the depreciation of the US dollar against Nigeria’s naira. He said: “The dollar, after moving up like a rocket going to space, lost speed this week as the Nigerian naira strengthened to N425 per dollar at the parallel market. “This is being hailed as a relief after remaining at N500 per dollar rate in the last few months. “Reports are saying this development is a result of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s recent modification to the forex policy.” Kola-Ogunlade added that release of the video of the song of the late talented singer, Eric Ayobami, also trended on Google. He said: “Although the death of talented singer has continued to shock his friends and fans, the long-awaited video of his song, The Sound, was released during the week.” The spokesperson said the released video was for television broadcast and video-sharing websites such as YouTube. According to Kola-Ogunlade, the news of the death of Neil Fingleton, the Games of Throne actor, who died at the age of 36, also trended. He noted that the seven-foot-seven-inch British actor played the giant Mag-the-Mighty in the popular American fantasy drama television series, “Games of Throne”. Kola-Ogunlade said: “The actor, a former basketball player, was recognised in 2007 by the Guinness World Record as the tallest man in the U.K.” He said that people also searched much about the start of the Lenten season. He said: “Ash Wednesday which usually welcomes lent took place this week. “It kicked off 40 days of intense reflections through prayers and fasting observed by many Christians across the world. “Catholics are known to go to church to be blessed with ashes on their foreheads in the shape of a cross to signify repentance and mortality.’’ Kola-Ogunlade said that other stories that trended on Google included results on the La Liga Table and European League Draw, and the confession of American top actress, Viola Davis, about her struggle with impostor syndrome. Google Trends, launched in May 2006, allows one to see how popular search terms and their demography have been overtime on Google. Share this: WhatsApp Telegram Email Copyright The Eagle Online.

How to Get a Data Center Job at Google – If you haven’t worked on Google’s data center team in the past, you won’t have the exact expertise you’ll need when you join, so, although expertise is important when applying for Google data center jobs, what’s more important is a sharp and flexible mind. Data Center Market Kicks Off 2017 With Flood of Acquisitions – Large telecom portfolio deals, enterprise data center outsourcing, and private equity exits, including Vantage Data Centers (potentially) and Cologix, all suggest that 2017 activity will set new records. No Shortage of Twitter Snark as AWS Outage Disrupts the Internet – The long list of companies affected by the AWS outage includes Adobe, Atlassian, Business Insider, Docker, Expedia, GitLab, Coursera, Medium, Quora, Slack, Twilio, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, among many others. By @qetzalcoatl How to Get a Data Center Job at Facebook – The social network is continuing to grow quickly, and every new Facebook data center means lots of Facebook data center jobs.

(Photo by Rainier Ehrhardt/Getty Images) LinkedIn Vacates Lots of Space at Equinix Data Centers – The social network company has been revamping its data center strategy, switching to an infrastructure that is more like other hyperscale cloud platforms, such as the ones operated by Facebook, Google, or LinkedIn’s new parent company, Microsoft. A part of this shift appears to be consolidating much of its retail colocation footprint into few large wholesale facilities. Infomart’s Portland data center in Hillsboro, Oregon, housing one of the latest LinkedIn server farms (Photo: Infomart Data Centers) A Cloud for the Artificial Mind: This Data Center is Designed for Deep Learning – The explosion of deep learning software development is driving a growing need for specialized computing infrastructure, geared for the types of workloads required to train neural nets. South Korean professional Go player Lee Se-Dol puts his first stone against Google’s Artificial Intelligence program, AlphaGo, in March 2016 in Seoul. He lost the five-match series. (Photo by Google via Getty Images) Google Ramped Up Data Center Spend in 2016 – Google’s capital expenditures were up in 2016, reflecting more investment in data center construction than the year before, while 2017 is poised to see another spike in infrastructure spend. Will the Submarine Cable Boom Drive More Revenue to Colos? – While it’s difficult to show correlation between the rapid increase in the number of submarine cables under construction and elevated data center leasing demand using hard numbers, it’s logical that the exponential increase in data flowing through new and existing cables will benefit data center providers with facilities located where they land. Court Throws Out Facebook’s Motion to Dismiss Data Center Design Lawsuit – BladeRoom, one of the two companies that filed the complaint, claims Facebook and Emerson Electric (whose data center subsidiary Emerson Network Power has since been spun out and renamed as Vertiv), lured it and Bripco (the other plaintiff), into disclosing their designs and methods and then turned around and used them to build a data center in Sweden on their own.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Console Gaming Week LG G6 Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 Nintendo Switch VPN News Google Home could soon solve a big smart speaker problem Google Home could soon solve a big smart speaker problem By Emma Boyle Digital home   Making smart speakers smarter Shares Though smart speakers have the potential to be extremely useful in busy households they face a big barrier in that they only support single user accounts. This could be a problem Google is well on its way to solving with Google Home. According to a recent report by Android Police, the code in the latest version of the Google Home app contains references to the speaker being able to be trained to recognize user voices.  Being able to distinguish different members of a household by their voices would make it possible for the smart speaker to support multiple user accounts. More users means more useful It would make sense for Google to be working this, particularly after reports have recently emerged that Amazon is working on the same ability for its Alexa-enabled Amazon Echo and Amazon Echo Dot devices.  Though Alexa does currently support multiple user accounts, switching between them has to be done manually which definitely detracts from how useful the device is.  Whichever device is able to overcome this voice identification barrier first and secure multi-user support will certainly have a big advantage in what is an increasingly competitive market. At the moment it seems that Amazon is winning the smart speaker war but such a significant feature could give Google the boost it needs.  Having a digital assistant for your home is useful, but not if every person in the house has to have their own device to make their own purchases and access the benefit of individualized recommendations for services like Spotify. Having one device that’s able to learn and accommodate the individual tastes of a whole household would certainly make it feel more an essential part of a home than it does currently.  That said, with only a few lines of code for reference it’s impossible to tell how far along Google may be in developing this feature or whether it will ever release it at all.  Good news: Google Home finally has a UK release date ABOUT THE AUTHOR Emma Boyle Emma is TechRadar's staff writer covering the latest technology news.

Leaving aside cases directed toward features related specifically to pharmaceuticals or to the Patent Medicines Notice of Compliance Regulations (PMNOC) the beginning of 2017 provides an opportunity to reflect again on the following cases and events from 2016: 1. File Wrapper Estoppel � Pollard Banknote v. BABN Technologies Corp File wrapper estoppel is a long and well developed doctrine in U.S. patent law.� By contrast, in Canada prosecution file history materials are generally not admissible in subsequent proceedings.� In a trilogy of cases1 in the 1950's and 1960's Thorson, P., of the Exchequer Court (the predecessor of the Federal Court) rejected the admissibility of the prosecution file histories. Oddly, Thorson P., cited as support the US case Catalin Corp. of America v. Catalazuli Mfg. Co.2, a decision that is one of the cornerstones of US file wrapper estoppel. The decisions were subject to critical comment at the time.3 More recent case law has occasionally edged toward the admissibility. However, in Pollard Banknote Limited v. BABN Technologies Corp., (2016) FC 883 The Federal Court of Canada was not prepared to countenance clearly contradictory positions in prosecution and litigation. In October, Stephen Beney and Nicholas Aitken had pertinent comments, found here. 2. Promise of the Patent and Utility �� AstraZeneca v. Apotex Since Turner v. Winter4 where an inventor has made a precise, explicit, disclosure of performance or use, the invention must satisfy that description5. Recently, however, PMNOC proceedings have tended to presume that all patents have "promises", whether or not such a promise exists. Yet in a non-pharmaceutical case it was possible to overlook remarkably narrow explicit promises that actually did exist.6 The rather strained, unicorn-hunting nature of promise-finding has been controversial, and has put Canada off-side of its U.S. and European trading partners. The Supreme Court of Canada has granted leave to Appeal from the FCA decision in AstraZeneca Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc.7, on this highly contentious issue. In March, Melanie Szweras and Scott MacKendrick weighed in at " Utility - The Heightened Disclosure Pendulum Swings Again", Mike Fenwick at " Supreme Court Promises to Review Contentious Patent Matter" and Adam Bobker and Daniel MacKay at " Leave to Appeal to SCC: AstraZeneca Canada Inc et al v Apotex Inc et al (FCCA)". 3. The Problems of Internet Enforcement Finding a remedy for sales of infringing goods over the internet is often an enormous challenge to patent, trade mark, copyright, and design owners, and one that raises thorny issues of extra-territorial effect. Rather than leave IP owners without a remedy, in Google Inc., v. Equustek Solutions Inc.8, the BC Court of Appeal granted an injunction requiring Google to take down web-sites not merely on Google.ca, but also on , the BC Court of Appeal granted an injunction requiring Google to take down web-sites not merely on Google.ca, but also on Google.com. The Supreme Court of Canada granted Google leave to appeal. Adam Bobker and Janice Calzavara discussed the issue in " Leave to Appeal to SCC: Google Inc v Equustek Solutions Inc (BCCA)". 4. Patents and Competition ���� New Intellectual Property Enforcement Guidelines The Competition Bureau issue a set of updated guidelines for the enforcement of Competition law in respect of Standard Essential Patents. Paul Horbal and Victor Krichker wrote about the new guidelines in " How will the Canadian Competition Bureau deal with enforcement of Standard Essential Patents?". 5. Other Topics and Cases Rule 216 � Summary Decisions In October, Alain Alphonse discussed the Federal Court of Canada's use of Rule 216 of the Federal Court Rules in Cascade Corporation v. Kinshofer GmbH 9 o resolve a patent dispute by summary procedure in " Patent Infringement Claim Dismissed after Summary Trial - Cascade Corporation v. Kinshofer GmbH et al., 2016 FC 1117." PMNOC s. 8 � Not a Vehicle for Unjust Enrichment Claims In February, Adam Bobker and Anastassia Trifonova discussed the Supreme Court of Canada's dismissal of an attempt by Apotex to use s. 8 of the PMNOC to ground an action for unjust enrichment in Apotex Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Company10 at " Striking Out Unjust Enrichment Claims under s. 8 for Good - the Supreme Court of Canada Denies Leave to Appeal". Patent Act s. 8 Corrections - Gray Manufacturing The reluctance of the Patent Office to exercise the Commissioner's discretion to correct documents in the Patent Office Records has been notable in recent years. Commenting on Gray Mfg Co. Inc., v. Canada (A.G.)11. Ken Bousfield poked fun at the Office in " Sunny Days, Sunny Ways? Gray Manufacturing: Federal Court Becomes Office of Administrative Corrections".� Inventions by Government Employees � Brown v. Canada12 In a move that caused some concern in the profession, the Federal Government attempted to employ a rarely used section of the Patent Act to defeat the reasonable interests of a patentee where the inventor was alleged to have been a government employee. The Court viewed the effort with skepticism. Noel Courage commented at " Canadian Feds Issue Patent, Then Try to Invalidate It in Court". Footnotes 1. O'Cedar of Canada Ltd., v. Mallory Hardware Products Ltd., (1956) 24 CPR 103; Riddell v. Patrick Harrison & Co., (1957), 28 C.P.R. 85; and Lovell Mfg. Co. v. Beatty Bros. Ltd., (1962) 41 C.P.R. 18. 2. 79 F. 2d 593 (1935), per L. Hand at 594, pointing out that file wrapper estoppel should apply whenever the applicant makes a substantive amendment directed toward allowability, but not where the amendment is formal. 3. See Gordon Henderson Editorial Note in Lovell, supra., at p. 23, for example. 4 Turner v. Winter (1787), 1. Webst P.C. 77 at 82, cited by Parker J., in Alsop's Patent at (1907), 24 RPC 733 at 753. 5. "[If] the Patentee says that by one process he can produce three things and he fails in any one, the consideration of his merit, and for which the patent was granted, fails, and the Crown has been deceived in the grant." 6. See CA 2 207 787 at p. 2, lines 2 � 14; 2012; Eurocopter, s.a. v. Bell Helicopter Textron Canada, 2012 FC 113; upheld 2013 FCA 219. 7. AstraZeneca Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2015 FCA 158 8. Equustek Solutions v. Google Inc., 2015 BCCA 265 9. Cascade Corporation v. Kinshofer GmbH, 2016 FC 1117 10. Apotex Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Co., 2015 ONCA 305 11. Gray Manufacturing Company, Inc., v.

 The CEO of the world's biggest ad company says Amazon — not his 3-month-old daughter — is what keeps him up worrying at night Lara O'Reilly Mar. 3, 2017, 7:20 AM 49,456 facebook linkedin twitter email print WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell.Oli Scarff/Getty Images As the CEO of the world's largest advertising group, WPP's Sir Martin Sorrell has been interviewed an awful lot during his long career. And he often gets asked the same question: "What keeps you up at night?" Speaking on WPP's fourth-quarter earnings call, 72-year-old Sorrell — whose wife recently gave birth to a daughter — shared his response. "The answer to the question, 'What worries you when you go to bed at night and wake up in the morning?' isn't a 3-month-old child," Sorrell said. "It's Amazon — which is a child but not three months." Sorrell has good reason to be worried. Right now, Amazon's advertising business pales in comparison to the likes of Google and Facebook. Amazon doesn't strip out its advertising unit specifically in its financials, but the company's "other" revenue in North America — believed to consist mostly of ad revenue — grew 60% to $1.3 billion in 2016. eMarketer predicts that Amazon will generate $1 billion in ad revenue in the US in 2017. That compares to estimates of $34 billion in revenue for Google and $15 billion for Facebook. Sorrell often refers to Facebook and Google as "frenemies." WPP works with them as a partner when it spends its clients' marketing budgets on search or social-media ads (WPP spent just under $5 billion of its clients' budgets with Google last year and $1.7 billion with Facebook), but Google and Facebook also threaten advertising agencies because they have the ability to work with clients directly, cutting out the middle man. Amazon's nascent ad business has the ability to do the same. Nobody in the online ad business has more data about the way we shop, how often we shop, and what items we look at and decide not to buy. Sorrell thinks Amazon is a huge threat to Google when it comes to search. If you're a sneaker brand, the most valuable place to advertise is when someone is actively searching to buy a pair of sneakers. On Google the person might just be researching, but with Amazon the consumer is most likely in the market to make a purchase right away. Sorrell described Google as the "friendlier frenemy" of the three online ad giants (as he has done before). He placed Facebook in the middle and Amazon at the unfriendly end of the scale. "It's early days with Amazon, you never know what's going to happen," Sorrell said. "We put together an agency in Seattle," the location of Amazon's headquarters, "specifically to deal with Amazon and cater to Amazon." Advertising agencies are also increasingly facing competition from consultancy firms. Firms including Accenture and Deloitte have been busy acquiring independent ad agencies in recent months. But Sorrell brushed off concerns that consulting firms presented an immediate threat to WPP. He mentioned one pitch, in which WPP's agency VML was up against firms including Deloitte and Accenture as well as traditional agencies for a $300 million account. (VML won.) But he said there hadn't been many other occasions in which WPP needed to compete against consultancies for big pieces of business, adding: "I don't think it's that significant." WPP's share price was down 7.75% at the time of writing after the ad group warned 2017 had gotten off to a slow start and its projected 2% full-year 2017 organic revenue growth came in below analysts' expectations. WPP usually forecasts annual organic growth of 3%. Sorrell attributed much of the drop-off to the loss of two big accounts: Volkswagen, which was worth $2.8 billion in bookings, and AT&T, which was worth $1.8 billion. 2016, however, was a good year for WPP. The company reported a 7.4% lift (in constant currency) in net sales to $12.4 billion, while profit after tax increased 7.2% year-on-year to $1.5 billion. As usual in the quarterly earnings call, WPP also shared its useful slide on all the macro and micro trends affecting the ad business right now: WPP Visit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

The cabinets are used to store servers from individual companies, power sources, and cooling mechanisms. Photo courtesy of Fiberpipe. A new tax incentive designed to help data centers offset the cost of replacing equipment could help Idaho attract large companies such as Google and Amazon, according to the Idaho Department of Commerce. The department proposed a bill to the House Revenue and Taxation Committee March 2 to grant a sales and use tax rebate to data centers that invest at least $25 million in capital investments within a five-year period and create 20 jobs within a two-year period. Additional rebates would then be given for equipment purchases worth at least $5 million. About 20 states have tax incentives designed to attract data centers and five states don’t have sales tax. The exemption would help Idahoattract data centers and additional investment in technology, said Bobbi-Jo Meuleman, chief operating officer at the Idaho Department of Commerce. “Idaho is in a prime location to attract large data centers because we have low energy costs, are at low risk for a natural disaster, have a high desert climate that provides free cooling and can help save data centers energy and we have available land,” Meuleman said. “The only issue we face when it comes to putting pencil to paper on these projects is that we don’t offer tax relief.” Several companies have visited Idaho, but have opted to build data centers in states that have passed tax incentives to offset the cost of replacing equipment. Data centers have to replace servers and other pieces of equipment every three to five years, Meuleman said. The department couldn’t name the companies that have visited Idaho because of confidentiality agreements, but Meuleman said that Amazon and Google are good examples of the types of companies that have been building additional data centers around the country. “I was in Washington D.C. three years ago and had the opportunity to go to a presentation by Google where they were discussing how they make their decisions,” said Jay Larsen, president of the Idaho Technology Council. “They had just decided to go to Provo, Utah and they did that because of an incentive like this.” The house committee voted unanimously in favor of the bill after listening to testimony from three of Idaho’s seven data centers and from several business associations in favor of the incentive. The bill will now go before the full House of Representatives. “Idaho is easily a top five when it comes to site selection,” Matt Klinger, vice president of the data center Fiberpipe, said about Idaho’s climate and geography. “But it comes down to a checklist and the last box that these companies are unable to check off is tax incentives.” Matt Klinger Klinger estimated that over the last few years his data center as well as other Treasure Valley data centers such as Involta and DataSite have had potential customers decide to settle in other states. “These type of companies usually sign five- to 10-year contracts with their data centers,” Klinger said. Involta, DataSite and Fiberpipe all said that the creation of this incentive will help with expansion projects that the data centers have planned. All three companies are looking at opening centers in northern and eastern Idaho. “We have a lot of businesses here that are prime candidates for a data center,” said Jeffrey Leonnig, regional director at Involta. “But they are being courted to move their components into other states.” Leonnig said many companies that wouldn’t move their corporate headquarters to Idaho are looking for a place where the risk of natural disasters is relatively low. “Several companies are currently looking to move their data centers east of the Cascades,” he said. The fiscal note attached to the bill estimates that Idaho will lose about $600,000 in revenue as existing Idaho data centers qualify for the rebate, but the state will earn that money back as new companies move into the area and existing companies expand, said Alex LaBeau, president of the Idaho Association of Commerce and Alex LaBeau Industry. “This represents an exciting opportunity for us to attract and grow a new industry in Idaho,” Meuleman said. The bill includes a 2024 sunset so that the tax incentive will lapse if Idaho doesn’t achieve the increase in technology investment it hopes to, Meuleman said.

Travis Kalanick’s taxi app is a $70bn global disrupter — but with sexism allegations swirling and political boycotts, Richard Godwin asks if controversy could drive it over the edge Richard Godwin Friday 3 March 2017 12:06 GMT Click to follow ES Lifestyle "It's hard to be a disrupter and not be an asshole,” was how one early investor described the singular charm of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Ever since he launched the paradigm-shifting taxi app in 2009, the pugnacious Californian, 40, has not shied away from confrontations with unions, authorities, safety campaigners, even his own customers as he has “disrupted” his way to 600 cities, 40 million monthly active users and a $70 billion valuation. However, this month Kalanick may have realised that being an asshole only gets you so far. Uber was already facing the #Delete Uber campaign that lost his app 200,000 users last month, as well as a Google-funded intellectual property lawsuit over its driverless car subsidiary and mounting claims of sexual harassment at the company’s San Francisco HQ. Rivals such as Lyft have been steadily gaining users and investment, while Kalanick was forced to stand down from Donald Trump’s business advisory council to placate his largely liberal, urban customer base. Then Bloomberg published a video taken by Kalanick’s very own Uber driver and we had a perfect storm of bad publicity. It’s shortly after a Super Bowl party on February 5. Kalanick makes awkward chat in the back of an Uber Black, the executive class of Uber, with a couple of women who don’t seem to know him very well. (“You’re a Leo?”) One of them has heard that Uber has had a hard year. “I make sure every year is a hard year,” Kalanick says. “That’s kind of how I roll…  If it’s easy I’m not pushing hard enough.”  Then he gets into a conversation with the driver, Farwi Kamel, who has been driving Uber Blacks since 2010. Kamel complains that Uber’s habit of dropping its prices is making life chaotic and unpredictable for people like him. They don’t call the precarious conditions of the modern labour market the “Uber economy” for nothing after all. “People are not trusting you any more. I lost $97,000 because of you. I’m bankrupt because of you. You keep changing every day.” Kalanick disputes his claims. Kamel argues back. Kalanick loses it. “Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own s**t,” he shouts. “They blame everything on somebody else.” Don’t you just hate people who do that? Read more Uber boss Travis Kalanick filmed swearing at driver in row over fares Kalanick was forced to issue a grovelling apology on Uber’s website this week, declaring it was time to “fundamentally change as a leader”. “This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.” But what this means is open to interpretation. Will he seek a new deputy, move sideways — or just do a bit of yoga and mindfulness? And having brought Uber so far, is he still the right person to oversee the promised transition to driverless cars and finally come good on the billions invested in him? Brad Stone is a Bloomberg Technology editor whose recent book, The Upstarts, charts the rise of Uber and other sharing economy companies. He disputes the idea that investors will be panicking at the content of the video — but they will be alarmed at the reaction to it. “The video really confirms what we all know. The reason Uber has succeeded is because Travis is combative and charges forward and likes getting into these arguments. He wasn’t wrong, either, that the reason Uber has the lowest prices is to compete in a competitive market. But he’s the CEO of a $70 billion company. He needs to be more astute.” The confrontation underscores the difference between companies such as Uber, which make things happen in the physical world, and companies like Google and Facebook, which operate online. “It was never a concern that Larry Page or Mark Zuckerberg would get into a battle with a member of the public because this wasn’t the world they were operating in,” says Stone. “They didn’t have a whole bunch of drivers whose livelihood depended on them. That means Kalanick has to be diplomatic and disciplined in a way that these other CEOs do not. If you look at Brian Chesky [co-founder of Airbnb], he’s very tactful when he’s out there talking to hosts. But Travis is just not capable of that level of decorum.”  Row: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick argues with one of his drivers (Bloomberg / YouTube) Indeed, for many long-time Uber-watchers, the surprise is that anyone’s surprised. “It’s a little like people who are only now upset that Trump is actually going to build a wall — it’s what he’s been saying all along!” says Douglas Rushkoff, author of Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus, a fiery critique of the scorched-earth growth strategies adopted by companies such as Uber.  “The fact that people are slowly becoming aware of the damage caused by Travis’s singular vision is a natural course of events,” he continues. “If you put oil companies in charge of energy policy, you end up with climate change. If you let bankers decide how money circulates, you end up with money accumulating up at the top. Here you have a guy who has vowed to use technology to drain marketplaces and generate stock value, and that’s exactly what he’s doing.”  Still, Uber has weathered adverse publicity in the past — from reports of its staff “prank” ordering 5,560 taxis from arch-rival Lyft, to claims that its American drivers are paid less than minimum wage. It has also invested considerable resources into lobbying for sympathetic treatment. The company’s head of policy is Rachel Whetstone, former darling of the Conservative Right and wife of David Cameron’s former adviser, Steve Hilton. (Kalanick reportedly refers to her as “the most powerful woman in Silicon Valley”). Kalanick, whose net worth is $6.3 billion, has also cultivated an elitist image that many see as outright “douchey”. He boasted to GQ about his success with women (“Yeah, we call that the Boober”) and has been accused of mishandling claims of sexual harassment by drivers.

However, the recent #DeleteUber episode is a sign that he may not be able to count on it. The hashtag gathered momentum as reports circulated that Uber was taking advantage of the anti-Trump protest around JFK airport in the wake of the Muslim ban. Kalanick had already issued statements of solidarity with Uber’s Muslim drivers, but the perception of Uber as the sort of company that would do that sort of thing was enough to see 200,000 deletions. Meanwhile, Uber’s closest America rival, Lyft, donated to the American Civil Liberties Union and quietly rose up the download charts. It is looking to expand to London soon.  More alarming is the detailed account that a former Uber engineer, Susan J. Fowler, recently posted on her website under the title “Reflecting on one very, very strange year at Uber”. She describes being propositioned by a male boss, and a depressing cycle process of denial and retribution from the human resources department when she complained. Another female Uber employee has anonymously posted similar claims — while Kalanick recently fired a senior engineer, Amit Singhal, as he hadn’t disclosed that he had previously left Google following sexual harassment allegations. Ellen Pao, venture partner at Kapor Capital and former Reddit CEO, was among the senior Silicon Valley figures to condemn the discrimination that is rife in the tech industry. “The fact that tech is this broken doesn’t give any company a free pass,” she wrote in Time magazine. “We  see you, Uber.” The reputational damage is no small thing in the hyper-competitive tech jobs market, where  skilled engineers are in high enough demand to vote with their feet. And Uber is a company whose business model rests on persuading women to get into strangers’ cars late  at night. Uber Creator: Travis Kalanick Meanwhile, it’s not as if Uber’s investors are actually seeing a return (unlike Snapchat’s, who made billions from the Los Angeles firm’s initial public offering this week). Kalanick is following the route laid out by his idol, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, who always put expansion before profitability — though some feel he may have to settle for being a company worth tens of billions as opposed to hundreds of billions. “The Uber investors that I know really just want the company to get to IPO as quickly as possible before it implodes,” says Rushkoff. “I’ve appeared on TV shows and podcasts that are produced by companies with large stakes in Uber. Before I go on, they’ll often say to me: ‘Could we not refer to Uber on the show, please?’ It’s as if they want to stave off the inevitable until they get their payday.” There are compelling reasons for delaying that payday, however. If Uber manages to achieve what’s known in tech as “total platform domination” — all rivals extinguished, black cabs a thing of the past — it can start setting the price where it wants, since drivers and riders alike will have nowhere else to go. Then come  driverless cars — no risk of awkward, uppity exchanges there. But this is why Uber’s biggest problem could be the lawsuit filed last week by driverless truck start-up Waymo.  (Image: Mark Warner/Flickr) It alleges that a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski, secretly downloaded 14,000 files before leaving to found his own self-driving truck start-up Otto,  which Uber acquired last summer. Uber is yet to file a counter-claim, and such suits are common in Silicon Valley (as you’ll know if you’ve been watching the sitcom Silicon Valley). However, Google — itself an early investor in Uber — doesn’t usually throw its weight around in this  manner.  “This is not an industry where they can slow down,” says Stone. “If Uber become less aggressive, it will be Google or Tesla who invent driverless cars — then Uber will be worth nothing. But if they don’t install the right guardrails, then there’ll be more stories of the kind that you’ve been reading about over the next couple of weeks.” For Rushkoff, Uber will face an even bigger problem if it succeeds. “Uber economy” has become a general term to describe the casualised jobs market of the 21st century, much as “Fordism” described the prevailing contract between capital and labour of the 20th century. Henry Ford was a brutal crusher of unionised labour who finally accepted that if he didn’t pay his workers, then soon no one would be able to afford to buy his Model-Ts. Rushkoff sees a cautionary tale.  “The biggest danger for Uber is that it will destroy the marketplace on which its business model depends — and thus run out of revenue opportunity,” he says. “If you bankrupt all of your employees, you’re going to run out of ways to make money. Henry Ford knew that and he was a fascist. But if we’re quoting Henry Ford as the new mouthpiece of progressive  values, well, that’s where we’ve  gotten to.” Follow Richard Godwin @richardjgodwin More about: Uber Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps Close We have noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Its card and board based system is perfect for to-do lists, goals, and any other sorts of tasks your team wants to accomplish. We’ve written all you need to know about using Trello, but don’t forget it has other great uses outside of project management like managing your team’s funds. With Trello, your team can easily keep track of and track tasks, goals, and anything else that’s important to you. 5. Zenkit While Trello is a big name in the project management space, Zenkit provides an awesome Trello alternative that’s worth a look if you need to manage more data than Trello offers.

It’s free for personal use, providing 1 GB of attachment space, 2,000 items per collection, and collaboration with up to five others.

Slack Slack is an all-in-one team communication tool that provides a place for friendly banter, important discussions, file sharing, and more. By dividing communication topics in channels, members of your team can get involved with information they need and ignore those that they don’t. You can directly message any team member or create private groups for side conversations. Slack allows you to share any file, and features all kinds of useful integrations to automate your workflow. Using Slack for communication is superior to emailing back and forth all the time or using a group chat in WhatsApp. Both of those are hard to follow and don’t scale well with more team members. With threaded conversations, @mentions for different groups, the ability to place calls from within the app, and powerful search, Slack is the communication app the modern team needs. It’s free for an unlimited amount of members, but limits you to 10 integrations and the most recent 10,000 messages, which is fine for small teams.

With Slack, your team has a central hub for all forms of communication. Bonus: Paid Tools with a Free Plan As a little extra, here are a few services that didn’t make the essential six, but are still worth a look for your team collaboration. GoToMeeting is more robust than Appear.in, and offers a free plan, that allows you to host up to three users per meeting. You can’t use the GoToMeeting desktop app, as the free service only supports meeting in Chrome. The free plan also doesn’t allow you to use any drawing tools during meetings, though you can screen share. Overall, Appear.in is a simpler option, but GoToMeeting is perhaps a bit more professional for meeting with clients. If OneNote doesn’t quite suffice as a whiteboard for you, Realtime Board is worth a look. The free plan allows up to three people to collaborate, with three boards per account. Whether you want to brainstorm freely, create a workflow or agile board, or draft up drawings, you can do it here. How Does Your Team Collaborate for Free? With these six tools, any small team can manage their data, work together to create documents, and stay in constant communication.

If you are hobbled with travel anxiety, this single tool can help you cope. Google Trips is by far the most underrated among the bevy of travel apps. Over the past few years I’ve played around with literally hundreds of travel apps The 6 Best Social Media Apps for Travelers The 6 Best Social Media Apps for Travelers There's no better way to explore somewhere than to do so with advice from people who have traveled there before you – and social media apps are the best way to connect with these insiders! Read More . I’ve used them for planning day trips and finding recommended restaurants. I’ve used them to figure out local transport networks and for storing reservations. But when you’re downloading four apps for every city you visit, the confusion is more hassle than it’s worth, especially if you’re on a trip that covers several countries. Better to buy a guide book. With little fanfare, Google Trips made its debut. Yet, it managed to combine the valuable parts of several apps (not all of them) into one, making this by far the best travel app I’ve ever used. What Can Google Trips Do? Being a Google product, you’ll naturally get the most out of Google Trips if you sign in with your Google Account. This helps the app find more data about your trips and your preferences, for better recommendations. When used fully, Google Trips acts as your personal travel assistant, helping you to: Store flight and accommodation reservations. Learn about local transport options. Discover and save top attractions in each location. Discover and save top rated restaurants, cafes, and bars. Plan day trips. Save notes about each location. Download everything for offline use. Use all these features to plan your trip before you leave. In other words, Google Trips is one hell of a powerful travel app (with a few drawbacks I’ll be covering). The huge amount of user-generated data Google collects and organizes (especially via Google Map How Does Google Maps Work? How Does Google Maps Work? Google Maps is used by millions of people every day and you might be one of them, but how does it actually work and how does Google maintain its accuracy so well?

These are features you can use to easily get the most out of your trip The 6 Best Social Media Apps for Travelers The 6 Best Social Media Apps for Travelers There's no better way to explore somewhere than to do so with advice from people who have traveled there before you – and social media apps are the best way to connect with these insiders! Read More . And calm any travel chaos before you leave home soil. Before You Leave Once you’ve signed-in to the app on your Android or iOS device, you’ll be asked for permission for the app to access your Gmail account. Trips will then scan your emails for flights and reservation confirmation emails. It uses these emails to automatically create new “trips,” so you can easily see where you’re going and when. When you go to the Reservations tab within a trip, you’ll see all the information the app could extract from your emails. This includes things like flight times, gate numbers, passenger names, hotel locations, links to relevant emails, etc. This makes your vacation far less stressful How You Can Shake Off Work Stress With Solo Travel How You Can Shake Off Work Stress With Solo Travel Are you overworked, under-rested, and increasingly stressed? Solo travel could help you feel more rested and recharged as you travel to new places. Read More than it could otherwise be. If you decide not to give Trips access to your emails, you can easily create an upcoming trip manually. Discover the City You don’t necessarily need to do anything else before you leave for the airport. But since planning a trip is half the fun, Google Trips makes it easy to start discovering a destination right away. Go to the Things to do and Food & Drink section of a trip, and you’ll find a list of the top-rated options in your destination sorted into categories. You can also see everything laid out in the map view. All this information is pulled from Google’s other products. This includes customer reviews and ratings, opening times, busy periods, descriptions, contact info, a map, and images. Unfortunately, the descriptions of attractions are extremely basic. If you want to learn more about a city and its history, you’ll want another source of information. If Google improves on these descriptions, this would be an amazing improvement to an already impressive app. Save any recommendations that you want to explore when you arrive. These will be stored both in the Saved Places section of the app. You can easily find them in the future on the in-app map. A word of caution: Although the attractions recommended by the app are fantastic, take the restaurant recommendations with a pinch of salt. Use the app to find the areas in a city where there’s a high density of restaurants. But avoid “touristy” restaurants (which often have high ratings). Prices are generally high, and quality low. It’s much better to just walk around and see which restaurants the locals frequent. Plan Your Days Having a list of top attractions, restaurants, and bars is a great start to any trip. But planning day trips in advance is a sure way to make the most out of your vacation. Go to the Day Plans section of the app. For many cities, you’ll see some aggregated day trips based on how long you’re going to be there, how other visitors have spent their time, the places you’ve saved, and your interests. The app will suggest the order in which you should visit attractions. But if you want to make changes, you can easily edit a day trip. This allows you to change the route, add or remove other attractions, or simply select how long you want the day trip to last. You can also create your own day trip from scratch, but it’s less fiddly just to edit one of the existing trips. Add Some Extra Info By this point you’ll have a pretty good idea of how you might spend your time while on vacation How to Turn Your Next Vacation into an Adventure How to Turn Your Next Vacation into an Adventure Adventure is a state of mind. Take a few ideas from here when you want your vacation to be a compromise between new excitements and familiar relaxation. Read More . But there’s probably other bits of information you might want to take with you, too. Luckily, in the Reservations section, you can save Notes, which you’ll be able to access offline. This is where I store things like the basics of a new language, detailed directions to my accommodation, etc. The notes are limited to text. You cannot save images so far. But it’s still a useful place to help you keep even more information about your trip all within a single app. Download Everything All this information is useful when it’s also available offline. The last thing you want is to get home to huge charges because you used all your data allowance How to Find Totally Free Unlimited Internet Access Almost Anywhere How to Find Totally Free Unlimited Internet Access Almost Anywhere We all like a freebie now and again. Free WiFi is top of most lists when we are travelling. Set out with these tools and tips to find free WiFi hotspots around the world. Read More . Before you leave then, click the download button for your trip. Google Trips will download pretty much everything available about the city to your phone. This includes access to an offline map, all your saved places, notes, other attractions, saved day trips etc. This is also the point where I’ll download a larger offline section of Google Maps How to Download Offline Maps in Google Maps for Android How to Download Offline Maps in Google Maps for Android Want to use Google Maps without an Internet connection? This is how. Read More . This is because when you click to get directions to an attraction in Google Trips, it takes you to Google Maps. Provided you’ve enabled GPS, you’ll can then get directions without using any of your data allowance. Once You Arrive Google Trips is useful as soon as you touch down. In the Getting Around section you’ll find out how transport in the city works, as well as the contact info for some reputable taxi companies. Click on the address of your accommodation 12 High-Quality Airbnb Alternatives for Any Budget 12 High-Quality Airbnb Alternatives for Any Budget Try one of these Airbnb alternatives if you are searching for the perfect accomodation. These vacation rental sites should have you covered, no matter how tight your travel budget. Read More , and Google Maps will open to offer detailed directions. Open the app when you’re hungry to find local eateries. Spend a day being guided around the top attractions in the city in the Day Plans section. Have easy access to information about your return flight. Limitations of Google Trips Although Google Trips is fantastic, I’ve already touched on some of its limitations. The descriptions of attractions leave a lot to be desired. I’d love to see more detailed descriptions so the app can teach me about a city, rather than just show me around. Better filtering options of restaurants etc. would also be a good move. On Foursquare, for instance, I can search for things as specific as “good Wi-Fi” or “falafels” but in Google Trips this isn’t possible. And for some reason, on Google Maps, the location of my accommodation is always displayed on the map (seems I use Gmail). But this isn’t shown on the map in Google Trips. I have no idea why, but it’d certainly make it easier to get your bearings from within the app. These are small niggles compared to what the app can do. Google Trips is an app that’s managing to make planning a trip easier than ever. It’ll never be a one-stop travel app, but it could easily become a staple for any trips you take in the future. Are you tempted to give Google Trips a try? It’s currently available for free on both Android and iOS. Has Google Trips made travel easier for you? What other features would you like to see a travel app like Google Trips introduce?

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Mobile Phones Google says there’s no cheaper Pixel 2 in the works Mobile Phones Google says there’s no cheaper Pixel 2 in the works By Sohil Nikam - Mar 3, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet The Google Pixel 2 has been under the radar when it comes to rumors, with only a few scattered reports so far hinting at what’s to come. One of the more interesting speculations about the handset is that the brand was working on a cheaper version of the upcoming flagship dubbed the Pixel 2B. Refuting such claims is a new report by AndroidPit which asserts that the Pixel lineup is staying premium. This comes straight from Google’s SVP of hardware Rick Osterloh. He apparently made it clear that there would be no cheap Pixel in a round table discussion. One of the reasons given for an inexpensive and less powerful Pixel 2B was that it might allow Google to spread its wings to emerging markets in which other OEMs stand strong with forked versions of Android. The smartphone would therefore serve to bring the native Google experience and high-end touch of the Pixel to more consumers than before. Also Read: Google kills Chromebook Pixel laptop series However, Osterloh’s remarks make it seem as if this isn’t happening. Google is likely going to leave the budget segment to other manufacturers. He also touched upon the release date of the Pixel 2, confirming that it will be arriving later this year. Unfortunately, he chose not to say when exactly the Pixel 2 is going to be launched, only mentioning that there is an annual rhythm to the industry which Google intends to follow. Last we heard, the device was still in development, so a fall unveiling like the original Pixel is the strongest candidate. When questioned about changes to expect from the Pixel 2, Osterloh said that the main problem facing the current Pixel is that there aren’t enough units to meet demand. Google supposedly can’t get the parts needed in the required quantities to manufacture more. Perhaps it’s looking to make sure this doesn’t happen again with the smartphone’s successor.

By Mark Bergen. Added by Agency Staff on 3 March 2017. Saved under News, Top Tags: Alexa, Amazon, Deutsche Telekom, Google, Hiroshi Lockheimer, HTC, Huawei, Mobile World Congress, Motorola, MWC, SK Telecom Tweet Mobile World Congress, the premier wireless technology conference in Barcelona, was supposed to be a coming out party for Google’s digital assistant. But at this year’s proceedings, the artificially intelligent voice-based service struggled to be heard above the din of an army of rival assistants that will soon jostle for attention on smartphones. As the event kicked off Sunday, the search giant announced the Google Assistant would ship on all new phones running its popular Android operating system. The same day, Motorola said its latest Android phones would come with Amazon.com’s Alexa voice-based helper, Google’s nemesis. Executives at Motorola parent Lenovo Group explained later that consumers who buy the latest Motorola phones can use both Alexa and Google’s assistant. Soon, they’ll even have a third option: the Chinese manufacturer plans to roll out its own AI-powered service on its devices this year. “I don’t really believe in the supremacy of one assistant,” Lenovo vice president of product Dan Dery said in an interview, describing the plan as “bringing AI to hardware”. Google’s version represents one of the company’s biggest bets since it began building a novel Web search engine in 1998. It wants to remain the main source of digital information as people talk to their computers more, rather than type. That will require its assistant to be on as many gadgets as possible. But Google’s hardware partners are also betting voice-based computing could be the next big thing, rivalling the mobile boom. VoiceLabs estimates 24,5m voice-based devices will ship this year in the US, up from 6,5m in 2016. Amazon leads, while Google is trying to catch up quickly. Some phone makers are integrated Amazon’s Alexa into their devices There’s also a rush to deploy AI techniques, resulting in a Mobile World Congress awash in digital helpers. South Korea’s SK Telecom displayed “Nugu”, an Internet-connected speaker akin to Amazon’s Alexa-powered Echo. Deutsche Telekom had “Tinka”, a customer service chat bot. Last month, HTC introduced Sense Companion, a personal companion service with voice recognition, on its newest Android phone. Even Will.i.am, a hip hop star-turned-tech-entrepreneur, is working on an assistant. When a reporter asked for a demonstration at the conference, the service struggled to follow commands. Aside from Apple, smartphone makers have largely failed to wring profit from software-based services and lessen their dependence on hardware businesses beset by shrinking margins. Samsung Electronics built its own mobile operating system, with little success, and Samsung Pay vies for mobile purchases with Google’s Android Pay on many smartphones. Samsung is trying again with assistants. In the fall, it acquired Viv Labs, a start-up formed by the creators of Apple’s Siri assistant, and is expected to release a digital helper with its newest phone in March. Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer denied these efforts undercut Google’s assistant. “A lot of [original equipment manufacturers] will choose to do that because they see value in assistants,” he said in Barcelona. “Competition is good.” Privately, other Google employees said they are less concerned that hardware or telecom companies will build a better digital assistant. Google’s search engine provides ready answers to millions of questions for its voice-based service, and the company has thousands of skilled engineers working on the project — resources that these other firms may struggle to match. Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer A larger concern is Amazon. The e-commerce giant has built a network of software development partners for Alexa, a service that, like Amazon’s flagship online shopping service, could dent Google’s core business of finding and delivering information. If Alexa is on a lot of Android phones, alongside the Google Assistant, which service will answer when people ask their devices valuable questions like which nearby restaurant to book or what holiday gifts to buy? In January, Amazon announced it was bringing the service to Huawei phones sold outside of China. Then came Lenovo at MWC. The story of the Chinese company’s Motorola division is a painfully familiar tale for anyone involved in Android. While it’s the most popular software for running phones, Android manufacturers have struggled to make money on hardware, while Google scoops up billions of dollars from mobile services and related ads flowing through the devices. Lenovo bought the Motorola hardware business from Google in 2014 and the integration has been tough: in the third quarter, Lenovo reported a US$112m loss from its mobile division, compared with $30m a year earlier. Dery, a former Motorola vice president who returned to the brand in July, is tasked with breathing new life into the business. Digital assistants are key to his plan. Lenovo’s coming voice-based service will rely on a personal identifier attached to all users of its hardware, allowing it to work consistently across Lenovo phones, tablets, desktop and laptop computers, said Dery. Dery described this as a supplement to the assistants from Amazon and Google. While those two services mostly respond to queries and commands, Lenovo’s will send notifications and alerts based on predictions about users’ behavior and needs, according to the executive. “We don’t like to call it an assistant because it’s misleading in a way,” he said. “This is something which is always aware, in the background, syncing for you.” By Dery’s telling, Amazon was quite pleased to hear about his broader AI strategy. “We shared that whole plan with Amazon and they realised, ‘Wow, this is exactly the missing piece for putting Alexa in everyone’s pocket,'” he said. Google wasn’t upset by the move either, he insisted. “They know our plan as well,” Dery said. Still, the more digital assistants get crammed into devices, the more crowding for Google.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Marcan Were Siyabaonga Cwele and Faith Muthambi not supposed to visit Barca ?

Specifically, that chatbot will change the way people interact with the Internet at large. Here's how: by Kristina Knight Kristina: You believe chatbots will change the way consumers interact with the Internet - why? Jordi Torras, CEO, Inbenta: They already are - look at Alexa, Siri and many other conversational chatbots. And it is not just the internet, it is access to information and conducting transactions. People are using chatbots to get stuff done - ordering pizzas, getting movie tickets, reserving their coffee order and changing their passwords. Chat in general is incredibly popular and brands are scrambling to have a strong presence in all chat platforms. The chat behavior is spilling over to search, with the average number of keyword search phrases on Google jumping from three to four. And instead of typing keywords, the trend is moving toward consumers typing questions. Unfortunately, with most keyword-based search engines, they're getting pages of options instead of accurate answers. Search technologies like Google changed how people interacted with the Internet, but I believe chatbots will dramatically change the way customers interact with information found on the internet and provide the information in a digestible way consumers want: conversational answers. Kristina: What specific changes do you believe we will see? We'll see chat platforms like Facebook Messenger and conversational commerce platforms like Alexa overtake search as the go-to point for consumers to get answers. Search was always a technology that forced an unnatural behavior on consumers. Technically-oriented consumers learned to "hack Google" and shared tips and tricks on getting answers and the right results on Internet search, while the rest of the consumers were confused and frustrated by the general lack of the technology providing answers for them. With chatbots and other conversational platforms, consumers will finally be spoiled with immediate, accurate answers to their questions. The key will be how intelligent chatbots are in understanding natural language and their ability to access, federate and effectively utilize the massive amount of data found on the internet and inside company's knowledge management and document repositories. Enterprise-class chatbots will arise and brands will flock to them for their ability to do just that and learn and improve over time with machine learning capabilities. Kristina: When might marketers and brands begin seeing these changes? Jordi: We are already seeing some brands deploying enterprise-class chatbots, yielding incredibly powerful results - both for the business and their customers. They are typically being deployed in specialized forms on their website, social channels like Facebook and on mobile apps. However, we're still very much in experimentation mode. Some brands are hiring teams or using agencies to build chatbots from scratch, however this approach generally has high up-front costs and yields results very slowly. Others are using AI-powered chatbot platforms like Inbenta to ramp quickly by using their existing internal knowledge bases and web information. It will take at least ten to fifteen years for consumers to experience the generalized AI-type chatbot found in the movie Her, though not likely in the extreme, dramatized form found in the movie. Kristina: How can brands and marketers prep for these changes? Jordi: Get informed on the new technology offerings around artificial intelligence for chatbot deployments. Start thinking omni-channel and view your customer's experience through their eyes. Understand their needs and test chatbot projects in specialized areas. Get some wins before committing to any one vendor. Make sure you consider up-front costs vs on-going costs and the internal requirements around staffing. Data-readiness and normalization is a typically a challenge as well, though organizations with robust knowledge management systems typically will have an easier time with their chatbot deployments.

The update brings along a dedicated icon to call upon Google Assistant, animated emojis, and an easier way to search for GIF images from inside the application. Earlier, users had to type @google inside the text field to call up the digital assistant but can now simply tap the dedicated Google Assistant icon to get its service. This change is likely to encourage more people to avail the service than before. "We're adding a shortcut to make it faster and easier to bring the Google Assistant into chats with friends," the search giant said in its blog post. Apart from the dedicated Google Assistant icon, the update brings along animated emojis to the app. In order to animate an emoji, users need to press and hold the send button and then drag up to "to see it come to life," Google said. Currently, there are only 10 emojis that support the animation feature in the app. Google has decided to make it even easier to search for GIFs while in conversations with the latest update. In order to search for relevant GIF images, you can click the smiley icon in the chat bar and swipe towards left side till you reach extreme right. Then you will find the option to Pull for GIFs.

Tuesday 7 Mar 2017 / Tehran - 13:17 / GMT - 09:47 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology http://fna.ir/QADVE Fri Mar 03, 2017 2:35 Android Marshmallow, Nougat Devices to Receive Google Assistant Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Millions of Android devices around the world will be getting a pretty huge gift soon, with Google announcing that its powerful AI-driven voice assistant. Google Assistant will finally be made available for eligible Android Marshmallow and Android Nougat devices starting today. The robust program is currently the search giant’s most robust voice-assisted program, easily superior to Apple’s Siri and comparable to Amazon’s Alexa. A report from The Verge stated that numerous areas would be receiving the Google Assistant, starting with Android Marshmallow and Android Nougat users in the United States, followed by those in the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and Canada. The exact timeline for the Assistant’s rollout remains unknown, but speculations are high that the A.I.-driven program would be released within the next few days. What is particularly convenient for Marshmallow and Nougat users is the fact that users of the mobile OS variants would not need to download a separate app for their devices in order to receive the powerful voice-assisted program. Android M and Android N users would simply be prompted with an update in their devices’ Google Play Services. Thus, while the list of compatible devices has not been released yet, Android M and Android N users would only need to check if their devices are receiving a Google Play Services update. If their devices get the update, they are eligible to receive the Google Assistant. An AI-driven voice assistant is not really new to Android users. Prior to the rollout of the robust Google Assistant, Android devices have had access to Google Now, a program that is very similar to that of Apple’s Siri. Assistant, however, includes a number of capabilities that are not included in its predecessor’s features. Among these improved features is Google Assistant’s capability to converse with its users using common language, unlike Google Now’s keyword-focused input. Apart from these, Google Assistant is capable of determining its users’ input even amidst consistent back-and-forth dialog, allowing interactions to be spontaneous and natural, according to a TechCrunch report. With its capability to perform numerous tasks such as taking photos, initiating searches, providing directions, translating input and checking the weather, Google Assistant is far more robust than its predecessor. What is really the Google Assistant’s killer capability, however, is its “Actions,” the AI-driven voice assistant’s capability to link itself to a larger, more open ecosystem, similar to Alexa’s “Skills.” What makes the Assistant’s Actions better than its counterpart’s Skills, however, is that the program’s capabilities do not need to be pre-enabled or pre-installed. Google Assistant debuted to much success during Google’s I/O conference last year, and it was fully featured as one of the flagship capabilities of the tech giant’s Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones that were released in October, 2016. During the flagship devices’ launch, Google made it a point to establish the Assistant as one of the smartphones’ most notable features. With the mass rollout of Google Assistant to Android N and Android M, however, there is a pretty good chance that the AI-driven, voice-activated program would be able to become as prolific as Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa. After all, despite the Assistant being released only to devices running Android Marshmallow and Android Nougat, the number of smartphone users with devices currently running the mobile OS’s versions are very noteworthy. Android M, for one, commands almost 31 percent of the market share. Devices running Android N number far less in the market, at just 1.2 percent. Android users who are eligible for the Google Assistant update would simply need to press and hold their devices’ Home Buttons in order to launch the powerful AI-driven voice-activated program, similar to how its predecessor, Google Now, was launched. Users could also speak the hotword phrase “Okay, Google” to launch the Assistant. With the Google Assistant, it would not be an exaggeration to state that millions of Android smartphones would get instantly most intelligent and useful.       LATEST STORIES (25) Iran: US Incapable of Restoring Security to Region Polish Economic Delegation in Iran IAEA Chief Confirms Iran's Non-Diversion from JCPOA Commitments Iraqi Forces Retake Turkish Consulate Building in Mosul after Nearly 3 Years Under ISIL US Starts Deploying THAAD System in South Korea Rights Groups: New Trump Travel Order Remains Muslim Ban Iraq Security Forces Take Mosul’s Main Government Complex, Museum Building Russian Soldier Killed in ISIL Attack near Syria’s Palmyra IBM Q's Radical 50-Qubit Quantum Computer to Push Computing to New Frontiers Water-Rich History on Mars: New Evidence New Materials Could Turn Water into Fuel of Future Compounds Could Be Basis for Devices That Turn Waste Heat into Electricity Syrian Army Raids Al-Nusra Positions in Dara'a Again Militants in More Regions End Battle against Syrian Army Syrian Army Wins back Nearly 20 towns, Heights, Farms from ISIL in Eastern Aleppo Iran: US Incapable of Restoring Security to Region TEHRAN (FNA)- Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi underlined that the US presence has increased violence in the region.

Telefonica SA’s O2 unit -- one of the first mobile operators in Britain to offer car insurance -- expanded its product line in February to include telematics boxes, which track people’s driving habits and can lead to cheaper premiums for youngsters. That’s stoking speculation that a wave of fintech companies will push into the market and disrupt the way insurers interact with customers. Cell-phone or Internet companies could, for example, use the massive amount of data they hold on their customers to sell them car insurance, bypassing traditional brokers and price-comparison websites.  Alphabet Inc.’s Google entry into price comparisons last year failed, but analysts say the web giant could come back and have another go. “No doubt Google will figure out a way to come back,” said Christopher Ling, a regional leader at Capgemini SA’s insurance practice for the U.K. and Europe in London. “For O2, it’s more dipping a toe in the water at the moment. Other ideas could be using mobile-phone data for home and health monitoring and the insurance associated with that.” Google did not respond to requests for comment. The insurance industry has long feared the entry of companies such as Google, Amazon.com Inc. or Facebook Inc. which have a closer relationship to customers -- and above all better data on them. The potential disruption to the market is adding to pressure on providers already seeing their investments hurt by record-low interest rates. Insurers are reacting to the challenge. Allianz SE Chief Executive Officer Oliver Baete has pledged to make Europe’s biggest insurer “digital by default” to help boost productivity and retain clients. Thomas Buberl, CEO of Axa SA, told investors last year that “customers are now used to buying things at Amazon to interact with Google and Facebook, they are demanding the same from us and, as you can imagine, buying an insurance policy at Axa is not yet quite the same as buying a book at Amazon.” O2 has jumped into “what is undoubtedly a very competitive market,” said Mark Evans, CEO of Telefonica’s U.K. unit. It plans to use technology “to identify driver behavior and therefore incentivize very attractive packages for those who drive responsibly.” Telefonica also offers car insurance in Spain and has offered products in the U.K. since 2015. Partner Up Fintech companies are already a growing, if limited, part of the global market: 173 startups focusing on insurance  got funding last year compared with 122 in 2015, according to venture-capital researcher CB Insights. The key for any newcomer will be finding the right partner, Capgemini’s Ling said. O2’s insurance business operates through a tie-up with Peterborough-based insurer BGL Group Ltd., which is also behind insurance offerings by companies including U.K. funeral care to supermarkets operator Co-Operative Group Ltd. and roadside-assistance company RAC. “The market for U.K. consumer insurance has always been incredibly competitive and another one in the mix certainly won’t help the margins,” said Ben Cohen, a London-based analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “It remains to be seen how new entrants in the insurance market grapple with data-privacy issues.” Shock Suggestion Citigroup Inc. analysts provided a wake-up call for the insurance industry a year ago when they suggested Google’s parent should buy insurer American International Group Inc. and turn it into a laboratory for innovation, possibly using the tech company’s client data to set policy prices. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Alphabet shut down its Google Compare service, which included insurance, in 2016 after the site failed to generate substantially more revenue that standard search ads for the products, the Wall Street Journal reporter at the time. But Baidu Inc., Google’s Chinese equivalent, and hedge-fund firm Hillhouse Capital Management Ltd. formed a venture with Allianz in 2015 to provide digital-insurance services in the Asian nation. “Monetizing mobile data is an incredibly exciting proposition,” Capgemini’s Ling said. “Other people will start to realize the potential of that in the same way as Google has realized the potential of monetizing Internet traffic.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

"If you look at the competitive reaction, if you look at Facebook's reaction in terms of copying or imitating a lot of the features that Snapchat has, that's indicative of the issues that Facebook faces in relation to Snap and its growth," Martin Sorrell, the chief executive officer of WPP said Friday. He added that whereas Google's direct competitor is more Amazon, Facebook's is now Snap - the parent company for social media platform Snapchat. "So you have a search war developing between Amazon and Google and you have a social media war, if I can put it that way, or market share war between Facebook and Snap," Sorrell said. Lucas Jackson | Reuters A woman stands in front of the logo of Snap Inc. on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) while waiting for Snap Inc. to post their IPO, in New York City. Snap had its initial public offering debut on Thursday and saw its stock rise more than 40 percent, pushing it well above the $17 a share it priced its IPO. However, when looking at digital advertising, Facebook and Google are the two big names in the market. Sorrell explained that out of the $75 billion that his company spends on media bookings, about $90 million went into Snap. Snap's revenues in 2016 were reportedly around $400 million with Sorrell suggesting the company was targeting about $1.25 billion for this year. "We'll see how far they go, that pales into relative insignificance to Google," he said. "Google and Facebook dominate digital advertising. They own about 75 percent of the market. And they get about 100 percent of incremental spend at the moment," Sorrell noted. "What our clients want and what our agencies and indeed our competitors' agencies want is more competition in the market place," he told CNBC. WPP posted its 2016 earnings on Friday with like-for-like revenue growth of around 3 percent. However, it also gave a conservative outlook for 2017 "given continued tepid economic growth." -CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

It marked a move towards Google branded smartphones along with a move to the ‘premium’ price range. Considering how impressive the Google Pixel was, everyone in the smartphone industry is asking questions about the Google Pixel 2. There are no official details or announcements regarding the second generation of the smartphone apart from the established fact that Google Nexus lineup is dead and Google Pixel is the new lineup that replaces the Nexus lineup. There have been reports about the company working on budget Pixel devices to target mid range or upper-mid range of smartphone devices in the market. According to a new report by AndroidPit, Rick Osterloh, the Senior Vice President of Hardware at Google confirmed at MWC 2017 that Pixel 2 is coming later this year and that ‘Pixel stays premium’. He further went on to add that “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it” when asked about the announcement and launch date of the successor. He did not make any further comments about the smartphone and maintained that there will be no cheap Pixel putting hopes of an affordable Google Pixel at rest. Pixel 2 is expected to arrive in the second half of the year with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and probably second generation of Google Daydream View. This comes days after reports of official 3D renders of Google Pixel 2 leaking out.

This was preceded by the launch of the LG G6 which became the first non-Pixel phone followed by the Moto G5 and the Moto G5 Plus to come with the digital assistant pre-installed. Starting today, Google is rolling out Google Assistant as part of an update to Google Play Services. The update will first roll out to users in the US, followed by those in Australia, Canada and the UK. The rest of the world will have to wait as the Assistant doesn’t support local languages other that English yet. You need not have to download another app to get the assistant. If your device is eligible, you will automatically receive the update. A long press on the home button will then bring up the assistant instead of Google Now. In order to be eligible, your phone ought to be running Android Marshmallow or Android Nougat and have a minimum of 1.5GB of RAM and a 720p display. The rollout will be slow and gradual with the English speaking countries receiving the update first. Other countries, including India, will have to wait for some time to receive it. But we hope it lands up here sooner rather than later. The Google Assistant debuted with the Google Pixel phones last year and was a runaway success amidst both critics and users. The ability to engage in contextual conversations and learning to get better at it over time has made critics pitch it against the likes of Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana and even Apple’s Siri which is the oldest AI-based assistant among them all.

 10 things in tech you need to know today Shona Ghosh and Jim Edwards Mar. 3, 2017, 4:55 AM 2,024 facebook linkedin twitter email print Vice President Mike Pence, AOL user.(AP Photo/Darron Cummings) Good morning! Here's the news you need to know this Friday. 1. Snapchat parent Snap's share price surged 44% on its stock market debut, after the company raised $3.4 billion (£2.8 billion) in its initial public offering. It was valued at $33 billion (£27 billion) at the opening price, and CEO Evan Spiegel is estimated to have a $4.5 billion (£3.7 billion) stake in the business. 2. Amazon blamed a major outage on Tuesday on an employee "incorrectly" entering an input command, removing a number of servers from service. The glitch meant sites including Quora and Slack were down for most of the afternoon. 3. Susan Fowler, the former Uber engineer who documented her sexual harassment complaints in a viral blogpost, has said the company is blaming her for users deleting their accounts. Uber denied the allegations and said it wasn't investigating Fowler personally. 4. Google will roll out Google Assistant more widely across Android M and N devices from today. The virtual assistant was initially limited to Google's own Pixel smartphone, but will launch for US users, then in Germany, Australia, Canada, and the UK. 5. SolarCity, the solar power company owned by Elon Musk's Tesla, cut around 20% of staff jobs last year, marking a sharp reversal on its previous growth. The company cut staff across operations, installations, manufacturing, sales and marketing, possibly due to a slowdown in the rooftop solar market. 6. Uber is applying for permits to test its self-driving vehicles in California, marking a U-turn on its previous position. The company had originally packed up its self-driving cars and taken them to Arizona for testing, after Californian authorities said it didn't have the correct permits. 7. US Vice President Mike Pence used an AOL email address to send sensitive messages while he was governor of Indiana — which was then hacked. Pence's emails dealt with issues like terror attacks, but the account was compromised by a scammer who sent fake messages to his contacts. 8. Snapchat creator Mike Platco has 500,000 followers but he can't even get a meeting at the company's HQ. “That was the very first in a long history of instances where Snapchat really solidified its position as giver of zero fucks,” Platco told BuzzFeed News. It might cost the company: Several major creators are moving their audiences to Instagram, where they say they get more support. 9. Chinese shopping giant Alibaba will invest $177 million (£144 million) in one of India's biggest ecommerce businesses, Paytm. Alibaba is leading a $200 million investment round which values the company at $1 billion. 10. Nintendo made the cartridges for its new Switch console taste awful so that kids wouldn't swallow them by accident. The games company coated the cartridges in the same agent used in anti-nail biting solution, which has an extremely bitter taste.

(Image: Reuters) Google has brought in a surprise for the users of its mailing service ‘Gmail’. Since many of its users tend to exchange data through emails, Google has increased the attachment size of an email to 50MB, which was previously capped at 25MB. There’s a catch, though. Google has limited this feature to the emails ‘received’ by the users. Anyone sending out a mail with an attached file still has to adhere to the existing 25MB limit. The update is welcomed by the Gmail users as it enhances the ease of data transfer through Google platform. For any data transfer above the prescribed limit, Google users can use Google Drive.

Exec teases Apple iOS support Google Assistant coming to the iPhone? Exec teases Apple iOS support by Sean Keach 03 March 2017 0 shares Read Comments A senior Google executive has teased possible future iOS support for the Google Assistant virtual helper. Right now, Google’s AI-powered digital assistant – Google Assistant – is only available on Android devices, specifically those running on the latest version of Android Nougat. But Google has been no stranger to building apps for the iPhone in the past, with many of its most popular apps like Maps, Hangouts, and Gmail all available on iOS. Speaking to Google Product Management Director Gummi Hafsteinsson at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Geekster asked whether Google Assistant would ever be made available on Apple’s iOS software. “I don’t think we have anything to announce at this point,” Gummi responded. "But I think the general philosophy is that we would like to have the Assistant available to as many people as possible.” While that’s not strictly confirmation, it’s a clear hint that Google ambitions for Google Assistant are much more broad than the current rollout. Unfortunately, what’s likely to be hampering Google’s efforts are Apple’s rules for iOS, which don’t allow for integrated third-party voice assistants. These rules help keep Apple’s own Siri digital assistant at the fore of iPhone users mobile experience, as opposed to a rival. That said, Google’s iOS search app comes with Google Now built-in – that’s Google’s Assistant predecessor, which has a much more limited AI brain. So why would iPhone users want Google Assistant if they’ve already got Siri? Well the key advantage of Google Assistant is that it has a heightened contextual awareness, and will understand your questions based on what you’re looking at on a page, or the questions you’ve previously asked. Apple, meanwhile, has been slow to develop the AI core of Siri, which means it offers a comparatively underwhelming experience.

But to get the feature on your device, you will need the updated version of Google Play Services, which wasn't available on the Google Play app store at the time of writing.

Note: International Business Times cannot be held responsible if anything goes wrong. Users should proceed at their own risk. First and foremost, two things are needed to download the update: An Android smartphone running Android Marshmallow or Android Nougat Google Play Services APK version 10.2.98 or higher You will need to head to APK Mirror and download the correct variant of the APK for your device.  In case you don’t know which variant of Google Play Services you need, you can check out Play Services Info app made by third-party app developer Weberdo. The app will show you the version of Google Play Services running on your device and whether there is an update available. 2017 is expected to be the year of artificial intelligence-based voice assistants, with Google and Amazon being the major players in the arena. Google started the trend with its unveil of the Assistant in October 2016, but Amazon caught up soon with its Alexa voice assistant. Both companies have come out with smart speakers running on their AI-based voice assistant. Microsoft too is expected to come out with a similar device combined with its Cortana voice assistant. In addition, HTC has already come out with its Sense Companion while Samsung is expected to unveil its Bixby voice assistant soon.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Entertainment Image Source: YouTube YouTube’s streaming TV service is called YouTube TV, costs $35 per month Chris Mills @chrisfmills February 28th, 2017 at 4:00 PM Share Tweet At an event in California, YouTube has just announced that it’s entering the world of streaming TV. For $35, subscribers to the YouTube TV service will be getting broadcast TV channels, some cable channels and the entire world of YouTube delivered to their device. The service is aimed as a rival to AT&T’s new DirecTV Now service, as well as options from Hulu and Sling. It will exist as a standalone app on iOS and Android, as well as options to stream to set-top devices like Google’s own Chromecast. Don't Miss: Why the iPhone 8 deserves USB-C A full lineup of channels isn’t available yet, but Google is being clear that the $35 service isn’t a competitor to full-fat cable bundles. YouTube TV will instead get you the four broadcast networks — Fox, ABC, CBS and NBC — as well as a few dozen cable channels like ESPN, Fox News and Bravo. At launch, YouTube won’t have any channels that are exclusive to pay TV like HBO, although that’s due to negotiations rather than a higher-up decision. It sounds like YouTube will be working on adding more channels (possibly in a more expensive bundle) at a later date. Instead of competing with DirecTV Now on channel selection, it sounds like Google is instead pushing the technology side. YouTube TV will have an unlimited cloud DVR, a Google-powered recommendation system, and a much better backend system than AT&T has been able to muster. Given the problems that swamped DirecTV Now at launch, YouTube may have a point here. YouTube has been at the forefront of playing on-demand and live videos for years now, and happily runs thousands of livestreams with millions of viewers on a regular basis. For customers frustrated with bad interfaces and buggy apps, the notion of paying a little extra to get ad-free YouTube plus a basic TV service, with unlimited DVR, could be a game-changer.

You may soon be able to subscribe to it over the internet with … YouTube. The Google-owned site, known for cat videos and do-it-yourself makeup tutorials, is the latest company to offer a version of cable that looks and feels more like Netflix. Dish, Sony and AT&T already have internet cable alternatives , and Hulu has one coming soon. None of these have yet been huge hits. YouTube is hoping its expertise in recommendations and search makes it stand out. Dubbed YouTube TV, the new service will cost $35 a month for access to about 40 channels when it launches in the next few months, similar to rivals. But it will be initially limited to a few cities where it has deals with broadcasters. And so far, Google doesn’t appear to have deals for popular channels such as HBO, AMC and TBS. THE ONLINE PROPOSITION There are roughly three million fewer traditional TV households in the U.S. then there were four years ago, a decline of about 3 percent. Online alternatives such as Dish’s Sling TV, AT&T’s DirecTV Now and Sony’s PlayStation Vue had about 1.5 million customers combined in 2016. But companies like YouTube believe a substantial number of people could be persuaded to pay for TV online. Many of these potential customers are younger people who have never had cable and watch shows and movies primarily through online services such as Netflix. But these online cable alternatives have drawbacks of their own. They may not offer substantial savings compared with cable, and offer incomplete channel lineups and inconsistent video quality. YOUTUBE’S OFFERING YouTube’s service will cost $35 a month, similar to the cheapest deals from AT&T’s DirecTV Now and Sony’s PlayStation Vue, but more expensive than Dish’s Sling TV. It comes with unlimited storage in a cloud DVR; only Vue also offers a DVR to all customers. It will allow three people to watch on different devices at the same time. The new service underscores how far YouTube has evolved since its early days as a repository for pirated shows and movies. Over the past several years, YouTube has beefed up anti-piracy controls and allowed television producers and networks to share in ad revenue. Those companies are now willing to partner with YouTube on this new endeavor. But YouTube still faces challenges making this work. In addition to the no-shows in its channel lineup, it will launch only in cities where it can offer live feeds of the major broadcasters, which tend to be larger metropolitan areas. (YouTube says it will work on expanding to other markets, although that will require cutting deals with the owners of network affiliate stations in those cities.) It will work on a TV only via Google’s Chromecast streaming gadget. WHAT’S THE PROBLEM? In general, internet TV services are an incomplete substitute for cable. Many popular programs aren’t available because digital rights are a hodgepodge. You can’t watch most NFL games on phones using these services — Verizon has those exclusive rights. DirecTV Now and Sling don’t carry CBS, and live feeds for ABC, CBS and NBC are available only in some big cities, as most network stations are owned by third parties. Although many cable subscribers say they don’t need packages of 500 channels, they don’t agree on which channels they actually want. These online services offer cheaper packages with fewer channels, but they are bound to be missing someone’s favorites. As with cable, the cost mounts the more channels you add. Cable companies also offer discounts when you buy internet and TV services together, which can be cheaper than getting them separately. Prices for the online services start at $20 for Sling’s cheapest bundle to $70 and up for the biggest packages from Vue and DirecTV Now. You also have to worry about data caps. Streaming TV in HD can quickly eat though a 1TB data plan in just two weeks if you watch multiple hours a day. While services like Time Warner and WOW still offer unlimited data on all of their internet only packages, you have to pay an extra $30 a month with AT&T Uverse to get unlimited data. Uverse does waive the $30 fee if you also sign up for wireless phone or TV services on a combined bill. Beyond that, these online services also have had quality issues with video freezing or not working at all.

Engin Bozdag 3 March 2017 Some designers have developed software that actually combat online filter bubbles. But how these designers interpret democracy – aggregating choice – limits these tools. Democracy is so much more. Yui Mok PA Archive/PA Images. All rights reserved.In the aftermath of the US presidential election that seemed to shock at least half the country, many liberals are asking themselves how they missed the popularity of Donald Trump. The ‘remain’ campaign for the UK’s shocking Brexit vote are also asking themselves how the other side won. One possible answer lies in a concept known as “the filter bubble”:  the idea that personalisation tools from companies like Facebook and Google are isolating us from opposing viewpoints, leading different parties to feel like they occupy separate realities. The theory argues that this in turn decreases the quality of information and as a consequence, civic discourse and democracy is undermined. To investigate this theory, Facebook conducted a study in 2015, and its findings show that exposure to diverse content is suppressed by Facebook’s algorithm by 8% for self-identified liberals, and by 5% for self-identified conservatives. As critics argue, this proves that users see fewer news items on Facebook that they disagree with which are shared by their friends, because the algorithm is not showing them. While Facebook and Google have been criticised because they cause filter bubbles and damage democracy, algorithms are not inherently bad. Some designers have developed software that actually combat filter bubbles. However, as I will demonstrate, how the designers interpret democracy shapes the tools they are developing. Metrics from liberal and deliberative notions of democracy are dominating most of the tools, and other metrics, such as ‘minority reach’ are not implemented by any of the tools. Liberal democracy and autonomy-enhancing tools Liberal democrats stress the importance of self-determination, awareness, being able to make choices and respect for individuals. They construe democracy as an aggregation of individual preferences through a contest (in the form of voting), so that the preferences of the majority win the policy battle. Filter bubbles are a problem for liberal democrats, especially due to restrictions on individual liberty and autonomy, restrictions on choice and the increase in unawareness. If Facebook and Google make decisions on our behalf, and provide us no options to control the information we are receiving, this is bad for the individual, according to liberal democrats. There are many tools developed with this notion of democracy, where metrics such as autonomy, awareness and choice are used. One of the first examples of such tools is Balancer (See Figure 1). It is a Google Chrome extension that analyses user’s web browsing history and shows the user the political slant of their reading history. A more recent example is PolitEcho (Figure 2). PolitEcho shows the user the political biases of their Facebook friends and news feed. The tool assigns each of the friends a score based on a prediction of their political leanings, then displays a graph of the friend list. It calculates the political bias in the content of the user’s own news feed and compares it with the bias of the friends’ list, to highlight possible differences between the two. Bobble (Figure 3) uses hundreds of nodes to distribute a user's Google search queries worldwide each time the user performs a Google search.  For example, when a user performs a Google search with keyword “Obamacare", this search keyword is distributed to 40+ worldwide Bobble clients that perform the same Google search and return corresponding search returns. Users then can see which results are displayed on their browser, but not on others, and vice versa. It is a tool for users to get an idea of the extent of personalisation taking place. The tool aims to increase users’ awareness of Google’s filters. Figure 1: Balancer is a browser add-on that shows users their biases. In this picture the user is biased towards reading from liberal news outlets. Figure 2: PolitEcho shows the political leanings of friends and the political leaning of shown posts in a user’s Facebook news feed. Figure 3: Bobble displays a user’s Google search results that only they received (in yellow) and results that they have missed but others have received (in red). Deliberative democracy and knowledge quality enhancing tools Deliberative democrats aim to create a public opinion through open public discussions, so that elections are infused with information and reasoning. The goal is to use the common reason of equal citizens, not just fair elections. Improving the quality of information, discovering disagreements, gaining mutual understanding and sense-making are among their other goals. Filter bubbles are a problem for deliberative democrats, mainly because of the low quality of information and the diminishing of information diversity. If bubbles exist, the pool of available information and ideas will be less diverse and discovering new perspectives, ideas or facts will be more difficult. If we only get to see the things we already agree with on the Internet, discovering disagreement and the unknown will be quite difficult, considering the increasing popularity of the Internet and social media as a source of political information and news. Our arguments will not be refined, as they are not challenged by opposing viewpoints. We will not contest our own ideas and viewpoints and as a result, only receive confirming information. This will lead us not to be aware of disagreements. As a consequence, the quality of arguments and information and respect towards one other will suffer. Respect for other opinions is decreased and civic discourse is undermined, There are many tools developed with this notion of democracy, where metrics such as information quality, disagreement discovery, mutual understanding are used. An example of such a tool is “This is fake” (Figure 4). “This is fake” allows users to submit items that intentionally spread misinformation. After a moderator reviews the submission, it is added to a database and users are warned when the item shows up in their feed. While the tool does not aim to highlight disagreements or improve deliberation, it aims to improve the quality of information. Similarly B.S. Detector (Figure 5) identifies fake news, satire, extreme bias, hate group, clickbait sites and adds a warning label to the top of questionable sites as well as link warnings on Facebook and Twitter.  Figure 4: “This is Fake” allows users to submit fake items and warns users about fake items. Figure 5: B.S. Detector warns the user when the site they visit contains conspiracy theories, extreme bias, hate speech, or fake news.FlipFeed (Figure 6) is a Chrome extension that enables Twitter users to replace their own feed with that of another real Twitter user. Powered by deep learning and social network analysis, feeds are selected based on inferred political ideology ("left" or "right") and served to users of the extension. For example, a left-leaning user who uses FlipFeed may load and navigate a right-leaning user's feed, observing the news stories, commentary, and other content they consume. While it does not aim to assess the quality of information, it aims to highlight disagreements and discover other viewpoints. Figure 6: FlipFeed changes a user’s newsfeed with another user’s from the other political ideology (left or right).Escape Your Bubble (Figure 7) asks users to identify whether they want to learn more about Republicans or Democrats and inserts stories into their feeds that align with the political leanings they wish to be exposed to. The extension then adds one clearly marked story that falls outside of the user's established political viewpoint every time a user visits the social network.  Figure 7: Escape your Bubble, depending on the user’s preferences, inserts articles into their news feed from the opposing viewpoint (republican or liberal). Considerit (Figure 8) is a deliberation (pro/con) tool that is developed with the aims of (1) helping people learn about political topics and possible trade-offs between different opinions, (2) nudging them toward reflective consideration of other voters’ thoughts, and (3) enabling users to see how others consider tradeoffs. It provides an interface where users can create pro/con lists by including existing arguments others have contributed, to contribute new points themselves, and to use the results of these personal deliberations to expose salient points by summarizing their stance rather than a yes/no vote.  Figure 8: Considerit helps people learn about political topics and possible tradeoffs between different opinions. Are the tools perfect, and what about other models of democracy? While liberal and deliberative notions of democracy dominate the created tools against filter bubbles, these models are not perfect. The liberal model of democracy is often criticised because it has no way of distinguishing normatively legitimate outcomes from the preferences and the desires of the powerful, and makes no distinction between purely subjective preferences and legitimate and shared (quasi-objective) judgments. It simply aggregates the choices of individuals. Deliberative democracy on the other hand is criticised due to limits of deliberation in large nations, widespread incompetence and political ignorance of an average voter and lack of time for real and frequent deliberation. Furthermore, too much focus on consensus via the deliberation of the majority might not provide much opportunity for the minority/challenging opinions. There are other models of democracy. For instance, agonistic democracy stresses the need to provide special exposure to the needs/opinions of minorities and and those who are disadvantaged due to structural inequalities. Agonists argue that just aiming for consensus and deliberation will serve the interest and perspective of dominant groups. As a result, minorities might never get the chance to reach a larger public. While it is possible to come across critical voices and disadvantaged views using some of these tools, it is also highly likely that these voices and views get lost among the “popular” items, which are of interest to the majority of the audience. As media scholars argued, media should not only proportionally reflect differences in politics, religion, culture and social conditions, but provide equal access to their channels for all people and all ideas in society. If the population preferences were uniformly distributed over society, then satisfying the first condition (reflection) would also satisfy the second condition (equal access). However, this is seldom the case. Often population preferences tend toward the middle and to the mainstream. In such cases, the media will not satisfy the equal access norm, and the view of minorities will not reach a larger public. This is undesirable, because social change usually begins with minority views and movements. In conclusion, while the efforts of these designers are laudable, most of the designers’ interpretations of democracy seem to be limited to “increase awareness, increase choice and hear the other side”. As American philosopher John Dewey observed, long before the Internet, social media and other platforms were invented, democracy is an ongoing cooperative social experimentation process. Dewey was of the opinion that we live in an ever-evolving world that requires the continuous reconstruction of ideas and ideals to survive and thrive. The idea of democracy is no exception in this respect. Hence, we should experiment with a plurality of democracy models, including ones that propagate agonistic elements. What should Google and Facebook do? Almost all of the tools I have mentioned are developed with limited resources and if they operate on popular platforms such as Facebook or Instagram, there is a risk that they get banned due to unauthorised access. They are also not likely to be used by the majority of Internet users. Google and Facebook often argue that they are not a news platform, they do not have an editorial role and therefore they will not design algorithms to promote diversity. For instance, Facebook’s project management director for News Feed states: “there’s a line that we can’t cross, which is deciding that a specific piece of information – be it news, political, religious, etc – is something we should be promoting. It’s just a very, very slippery slope that I think we have to be very careful not to go down”. However, research shows that these platforms are dominant social platforms when it comes to news consumption. According to a study from 2016, most people in the US read news from their phones and of those on Facebook, more than two-thirds use it for news. Another recent study indicates that social media has overtaken television as young people's main source of news. Meanwhile, news sites rely more and more on Facebook for social traffic. For instance, in the first quarter of 2016, Buzzfeed received 201,343,000 worldwide desktop visits from Facebook alone. If we also consider the dominant position of these platforms in the search and social media markets worldwide, we can argue that they are indeed important news and opinion sources. Considering their dominant status, online platforms should adapt and experiment with the metrics and approaches that I have outlined. Breaking bubbles requires an interdisciplinary approach, as several disciplines including human-computer interaction, multimedia information retrieval, and ethics all have something to contribute. More experiments with different contexts will need to be conducted in order to find which techniques work and which do not. Once we have more concrete results, the systems could apply different strategies for different types of users.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google Play Store Will Now Show Apps Sale Pricing And High-Quality Games By Zara Ali Feb 28, 2017 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Google is bringing some new features and changes to Play Store. These new developments will make it easier to discover new games and also see sale pricing on apps. The discounted pricing on apps will be updated by developers, which means that Google is now providing enhanced control to every app developer for their own app listings on the Play Store. Google announced these features at the ongoing Game Developer Conference. Developers can update discounted pricing along with the timeline for its validity. Earlier, this feature was only limited to TV Shows and Movies listings, but now even developers will be able to indicate sale pricing on their app listing. Until now, developer had to change the set pricing of the app to discounted pricing without being able to indicate about the running discount, which was also confusing for consumers as they used to find variable pricing for the same app. The new feature shows the actual pricing in strikethrough and discounted pricing above it with purchase button beside it. There will also be a banner with the word “Sale” written on it. However, it does not mean that developers will be able to trick buyers. Google has laid down rules for a sale – the app must be on at least 30 percent discount and the sale should stay active for a full day (24 hours) and maximum for 8 days. After the end of the sale, developers will have to wait for 30 days for listing the next sale. Advertisement It is worth noting that sale could only be offered for apps purchase and not for subscription based services and in-app purchases. These new features will debut with a small update and will be quite helpful for both consumers and developers. In a pilot run of the new sale feature, Google says that developers witnessed up to twenty times more installations. Not just app pricing, Google is also working on improving visibility of games on Play Store. The tech giant announced that it will be promoting games with high-quality gameplay. Earlier, the visibility was based on number of installs, but now it will be based on quality as well. Google is fixing a lot of issues on Play Store and is looking forward to improve user experience by launching helpful features. By promoting games on quality, Google wants to help small developers in reaching wider audience. In its blog post, Google also said that it is bringing new high quality games such as TRANSFORMERS: Forged to Fight, Battle Breakers, Injustice 2, Beartopia, and Virtual Rabbids to Play Store. You can pre-register for these games by clicking on this link.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Pixel 2 will be launched this year, will stay premium says Google Hardware SVP A recent report said that Google is testing several versions of Pixel 2 smartphones, including a Pixel version codenamed Pixel 2B aimed at emerging markets. However Google’s SVP for hardware Rick Osterloh in a meeting at the MWC 2017 said that the Pixel 2 will be released this year, and will stay premium. So this confirms that there will be no cheap Pixel as rumored earlier. Google will continue to leave lower price segments to other manufacturers. He also took Twitter to confirm a recent report that said no new Pixel Chromebooks are in the works. He said that “Chromebooks aren’t dead, they will live on, we just have no plans to share at this time” So there are chances that Google’s own laptops might launch in a different name, possible running Google’s Andromeda OS. According to earlier rumors, the Pixel 2 will be waterproof, a feature that is present on most flagships and was missing on the original Pixel. The Pixel 2 will likely be IP67- or IP68-rated, allowing for water submersion up to 1 to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. It is expected to be powered by Snapdragon 835 chip and the company is said to focus further on camera on the successor to improve low-light photography. The Pixel 2 is said to see at least $50 price increase, so it might start at $699.

That’s what we’ve learned thanks to quotes gleaned from a roundtable discussion with Google at MWC 2017, which was attended by Android Pit. One of the Googlers at the roundtable was Rick Osterloh, who heads up the company’s hardware division. When probed on a possible for Google Pixel 2 release date, Osterloh confirmed that the Pixel series wasn’t just an experiment, and that there would definitely be another device coming up in 2017. “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it,” Osterloh said, adding: “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” The first Google Pixel smartphone was announced and released in October 2016, so we’d imagine Google will probably stick to a similar timeline next time around. It’s a good period to launch a phone as there’s opportunity to scoop up pre-Christmas seasonal spending, although the downside is that it means going head-to-head with Apple’s next smartphone – the iPhone 8, perhaps? The other titbit we learned from the roundtable is that “Pixel stays premium”, i.e. that Google won’t be launching low-end Pixel smartphones. That makes sense, as the Pixel devices are intended to showcase the very best of what Android has to offer. Plus, profit margins are incredibly thin when manufacturing low-end Android handsets, so Google will likely want to retain the Pixel line as a money-spinner.

The platform will allow telecom operators to make use of Google’s networking infrastructure including its data centers, edge servers, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), among others. Note that Airtel had recently awarded a 4G network deployment deal in the Indian market to Nokia Networks. Nokia’s networking arm already manages 4G services for Bharti Airtel in six circles since September 2015 Google mentions that its partnership with telecom companies will allow operators to better place them self to adapt next generation networks like 5G, using “many of the same principles that we’ve adopted to power our own networking infrastructure.” Telcos will also be able to utilize Google’s Software Defined Networking (SDN) services—a network wherein admins can program, route, initiative and manage connections easily—to help them better optimize networks and control traffic patterns. The company currently has data centers in the US, Europe and Asian countries and exchanges traffic with network operators (traffic peering) for better service delivery. Apart from this Google is also providing custom APIs to operators, like the ‘Mobile Data Plan API” that allows users to keep track of their data usage and set data limits. It is also rolling its open-source networking platform, CORD which allows telcos to manage their networks on a real-time basis to more telecom operators across the globe.

Designed as premium smartphones and with a price to match, the Pixel and Pixel XL are designed to represent Google's version of a perfect Android smartphone, with the hardware and software seamlessly working together. While we are still a long time from the launch of the Pixel 2, latest rumors indicate that the successor to the Pixel will see key improvements in major areas such as the processor and camera and will remain a premium device. Google's head of hardware Rick Osterloh confirmed to Android Pit that the Pixel devices will stay premium and there will not be a budget Pixel phone in the near future, with the company leaving lower price points for other hardware manufacturers. Also Read: Top 10 phones announced at MWC 2017: Nokia 6, Moto G5, LG G6 and more He also hinted at a fall announcement for the Pixel 2 by saying " There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it. You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now". Pixel 2 wishlist The current Pixel duo lack some key features which we would like to see in their successor such as dust/water resistance, optical image stabilisation, wireless charging and stereo speakers. Google could also do with reducing the size of the bezels and tweaking the current 'love it or hate it' design. Pixel/ Pixel XL specifications The Pixel and XL come with everything expected of a flagship smartphone in today's times - 4GB of RAM, a 5.0'/5.5' AMOLED display with Gorilla Glass 4 on top, 32/128GB of internal storage and the Snapdragon 821 processor. The Google Pixel comes with Google Assistant, Google's answer to the Siris and Cortanas of the world. Assistant builds upon Google Now's foundation but takes things up several notches. Google Assistant can be used to open apps, text someone, play/pause music, call your friends, post a tweet, make movie reservations and much more. Where it pulls ahead of both Siri and Cortana is the fact that Assistant is extremely smart. The more you use it, the more useful it will become. The Google Pixel smartphones also come with the Pixel launcher, which is exclusive to Pixel smartphones and brings with it an all new app launcher and rounded app icons. It also replaces Google Now with Google Assistant. Also Read: HTC U Ultra vs Google Pixel: Is HTC finally back in the game?
