That YouTube Go app is now live in India and is already available for download on Google Play Store. However, the app is still in beta and is only available for download as a part of Google's early access programme.    The app will let you download or play most of the YouTube videos to your device but only in ‘Basic’ and ‘Standard’ quality. Also, a lot of features from the native YouTube app are missing such as the ability to swipe down the currently playing video and browse other content at the same time. However, the new YouTube Go app lets you preview videos before you download it.   Opening up the app, you will be asked to choose your preferred language among tonnes of Indian regional languages. Post that, you will be asked to enter your mobile number for one-time verification after which you will be also asked to log in or choose your current synced Google accounts. The mobile number verification also simplifies the whole process of sharing your videos with your friends later on.   Once you reach the home tab, you can browse through recommended videos or search for a specific YouTube video you want to download. On tapping a particular video, the app will automatically start displaying the preview and will ask you to either play or download the video. Apart from showing two options for video quality i.e. Basic and Standard, the app also displays the amount of memory it will take on your device.   Once downloaded, you can then navigate to the ‘Saved’ tab placed on the right where you can send and receive videos from your friends via Bluetooth.   While the app does miss out some features including different tabs for Trending, Subscriptions and Recommended, it can be hit amongst the people it is targeted to. Till then, what do you think about this new YouTube Go app?   Source YouTube YouTube Go Android Google Play Store YouTube Videos download YouTube Go Download Save Offline YouTube YouTube Videos First Published : Saturday, February 11, 2017 - 14:18 Similar News YouTube mobile live streaming now available for users, Super Chat also debuts in India Now Double Tap to forward and rewind videos on YouTube YouTube brings new Super Chat feature, will help broadcasters earn money YouTube to push vernacular content for India users YouTube launches offline viewing feature for videos valid for 48 hours in India Hot Trend on TMI WhatsApp rolls out two-step verification for extra layer of security Top 5 new apps you can explore Jio Cinema, Jio Music app on Android gets a Smart Download option , iOS users have to wait Apps like Clean Master boon or bane for your Android smartphones?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile 5 ways Android has taken Apple’s ideas and made them better Image Source: Ng Han Guan/AP/REX/Shutterstock Zach Epstein @zacharye February 7th, 2017 at 11:44 AM Share Tweet Apple’s iOS platform and Google’s Android platform both emerged at around the same time a decade ago, but there’s precious little question that one platform in particular was steering the ship in the early days. Google’s Android team had been hard at work building a boring BlackBerry clone, but Google did something that other platform makers failed at miserably. Google took one look at the iPhone Apple unveiled in early 2007 and it instantly knew it was cloning the wrong mobile experience. Meanwhile, big cell phone companies like Nokia, BlackBerry and Microsoft kept chugging along without adapting at all. Google’s reworked Android platform would launch commercially in late 2008 on the HTC Dream/G1, and it wisely resembled Apple’s iPhone far more than it resembled a BlackBerry phone. In the years that followed, Apple and Google would go on to overtake the global cell phone market as other platforms floundered and failed. It’s clear that iOS and Android took inspiration from each other every step of the way, but in this post we’ll look at five ways in particular that Android took Apple’s ideas from the iPhone and made them even better in Android. Don't Miss: The one way Android will never, ever be able to compete with the iPhone High-resolution displays Just like the touchscreen itself, high-resolution displays have become ubiquitous and as a result, it can be difficult to remember a time before smartphone displays became as sophisticated as they are right now. But it all began in 2010, when Apple started a pixel war with the Retina display on the iPhone 4. Today, nearly seven years later, Apple smartphones have the lowest resolution among all flagship devices. Now, it’s important to note that while Apple had been lagging far behind market leaders like Samsung for years when it comes to display quality, the screens on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have narrowed the gap substantially. Although resolution hasn’t improved on either device, other improvements and support for a wider color gamut have brought Apple’s iPhones closer in display quality to AMOLED panels from the likes of Samsung. App Store No, Android doesn’t have better apps than iOS. In fact, the gap in user experience and overall app quality between the two platforms is just as wide now as it has been for years. While Android affords developers far more flexibility, iOS apps are alway smoother and they offer a much more consistent experience. Where app stores are concerned, iOS and Android each have their pros and cons where app distribution is concerned — the Play Store is cluttered and confusing at times, while search is still awful in the iOS App Store — but there’s one area where Android just leapt ahead of Apple by a huge margin: Instant Apps. The new Instant Apps feature google unveiled last year during its annual I/O developer conference is a stroke of genius. In a nutshell, it allows developers to turn a portion of their apps into web apps that can be accessed instantly without any need to purchase or even download an application. So for example, a person can begin using a portion of a paid app instantly without making any purchase. Then, a purchase can be made if the person wants to keep using the app beyond a certain point. Quick Settings Android has always had some settings available in the pull-down “shade” menu, but it wasn’t until Apple’s Control Panel came around that Google stepped things up and created the versatile quick settings panel users enjoy today. Different vendors have made a wide range of tweaks to the Quick Settings menu in their various Android builds, but the endgame is the same: Users have easy access to a customizable menu that allows them to tweak more than a dozen settings from any screen. One of the most frustrating things about the Control Panel in iOS is that it is not customizable. So, if there are settings you access constantly that aren’t included in the Control Panel, you’re just out of luck. Android, meanwhile, has a much wider range of settings that are accessible on the Quick Settings menu. What’s more, the menu is customizable so you can remove settings you don’t often use, add settings you want to be able to configure, and rearrange items in any order of your choosing. Keyboards Apple’s virtual keyboard on the iPhone was a complete game changer, but there’s little question that Apple has been lapped at this point. First and foremost, third-party keyboard support in iOS is still horrendous. Apple’s keyboard offers a terrific typing experience thanks to a great design and class-leading touch response on iPhones and iPads, but people often want more than that. For example, swipe-style typing is hugely popular and Apple’s keyboard doesn’t support it. There are also third-party keyboard with better emoji functionality and dozens of other features that are nowhere to be found on the built-in iOS keyboard. But third-party options are severely constrained, keyboard support is buggy at best. Android, meanwhile, has a terrific built-in keyboard but it also gives third-party developers the freedom to access all of the OS features and functions they want. The result is a keyboard experience that feels and functions like a fully integrated OEM keyboard. Software Updates Software updates? Really?! Apple still gets updates out faster since it releases updates directly to end users rather than to vendor partners, but Android Nougat’s new update mechanism is brilliant. Instead of having to stop everything you’re doing to update your smartphone running Android 7.0 or later, software updates are downloaded in the background over Wi-Fi while you use the phone. Once the download is complete, everything still happens in the background because the new Android build installs to a special separate partition. Then, the next time the phone is rebooted, the new software version boots and the update it done — that’s it.

The search giant’s attempt to migrate the internet from HTTP to HTTPS has actually changed HTTP redirects impact on SEO ranking. Website migration and performance upgrades no longer have the same impact on PageRank. In fact, in some cases, redirects are only a formality. Today we’re looking at Google’s new HTTP standards, but first, let’s refresh ourselves on traditional HTTP redirect practices. HTTP Codes And Redirects: Their Original Application HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol. The protocol in question facilitates communication between different systems. In this case, transferring data between a web server and web browser. The five different classes of redirects are as follows: 100. The 100 redirect indicates that your browser requested a server, but that request is still processing. 200. This 200 status code is what you want to see. These codes indicate the server received your browser’s request and processed it successfully. 300. 300 redirects appear when the server tells your browser the requested page has either temporarily or permanently moved. Your originally requested resource is no longer available. 400. These codes indicate a problem with your resource request. 500. The 500 code appears when your browser requests access a specific resource and is successful, but the server cannot deliver the website in question. So How Do These Codes Affect SEO? Let’s break down how each codes affects your digital marketing. 200 Successful The 200 code, as mentioned before, means everything is operational. Your browser was able to request the resource which the server was then able to deliver. Webmasters look for as many 200 codes as possible when running technical audits. 301 Permanent Redirect The 301 redirect appears when your requested resource is reassigned. This happens when a site has migrated, or pages have been moved, URLs been renamed, or content has been consolidated. Typically a permanent redirect signals to search engines to bring over all ranking information for the old URL to the new URL. 302 Redirection 302 redirection occurs when the server finds your resource request, but the page exists in a different location. Requests still use the original resource location. A 302 redirect traditionally tells Google that your page has been temporarily moved to a new location. Traditionally technical SEO holds that temporary redirects do not bring over ranking information of the old location to the new the way a 301 Permanent Redirect would. While this is technically correct, Google, in time, tends to treat a temporary redirect as a permanent one, including all its benefits. 400 Bad Request The 400 status code returns when your resource request has an invalid syntax. This can happen for reasons including: Corrupt cookies associated with the site in question. Invalid requests due to a bad browser. Invalid requests due to human error. 401 Unauthorized This request appears when the you’re attempting to access a website without proper credentials. These protected resources require a username and password. If this is intended, if this is part of your marketing strategy, no harm is done. If this happens accidently, and now all or parts of your content are hidden behind a login, that’s of course not a good thing. 404 Not Found 404 status codes appear when you're able to communicate with the server, but cannot find the requested resource. “Not Found” pages are not a technical SEO problem; they’re not a source of (de)ranking or a penalty cause: 500 Internal Server Error This code appears when the server cannot process your resource request. These are common errors often due to server misconfiguration. Malformed .htaccess files and missing packages from a PHP file executed incorrectly are frequent suspects. Internal Server Errors can have a very strong, negative impact on your SEO, especially if the situation goes undetected for a while. Occasional errors aren’t an issue; things happen. But if the situation is more or less permanent, when pages that should be served aren’t shown because the webserver sending the pages experiences an error when it tries to show the page, your SEO is of course impacted. 502 Bad Gateway This HTTP code informs you that one server received a bad response from another server. Usually you have no technical control over this situation and usually the situation will resolve itself. Sometimes the issue is caused by you or your network; your browser thinks there’s something wrong. This is a problem with your browser and/or the network at your home. SEO impact is negligible. 503 Service Unavailable The 503 HTTP code indicates that the server responsible for processing your request is temporarily unavailable. It’s like a “404 Not Found” for a complete computer instead of just a page. Usually the computer, the server, is too buys, is undergoing maintenance, or has issues with inadequate memory or CPU power. Temporary 503 notices are not a problem and are, in fact, the preferred status code by search engines when your server is temporarily unavailable. Lasting 503 notices can result in URL’s being removed from a search engine’s index and thus have a severe affect on you SEO. 504 Gateway Timeout A server didn’t get a timely response from another server while trying to send you the page you requested. Usually this server isn’t under your control, so there’s not a lot you can do. If the situation happens frequently, check with your technical staff; sometimes heavy traffic or corrupt databases can cause this same error to show. In that case, the SEO impact could be noticeable . Now That We Know What’s Bad, How Do We Identify The Issues? Finding the specific issue with your redirects falls to third party software designed specifically for identifying status codes at scale. Some of our favorites: A1 Website Analyzer: Industry-strength crawler for serious crawls, no matter the size of a site. Screaming Frog: This spider finds all of the URLs belonging to your domain, making it easy to separate code by URL. Deep Crawl: Deep crawl works just like Screaming Frog, expect on cloud based software and with the ability to better handle large domains. Link Redirect Trace: Link Redirect Trace is a browser extension that monitors for HTTP codes on the fly. Google Search Console: Search console is excellent to identify exactly what Google sees. Check the Crawl > Crawl Error reports to find URLs Google isn’t understanding. Keeping An Eye On Your Site   Consistently Audit Your URLs: Use the programs listed above to audit your site on a regular basis. Catch issues before they can hurt your SEO. Fix Common Issues: Check if the errors you see are expected. Is this temporary? Does it happen frequently? Site Migrations: Preferably use page level 301 Permanent Redirects.

The Congress Vice President also said that the Prime Minister will get a "jolt" once the results of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections are out. "Modi likes to read janampatri (horoscope), search Google and peep into the bathrooms of people... but he is a failure as a Prime Minister," he said at a joint press conference with Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav where the SP-Congress alliance released a 10-point Common Minimum Programme (CMP). Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi. Reuters "He (Modi) can do this (peeping into bathrooms) in his free time," Rahul said. His comments come against the backdrop of the Prime Minister's remarks in Parliament that one should learn the art of "bathing with a raincoat on" from Manmohan Singh as there was not a single taint on him despite so many scams having taken place during his regime. Modi had said in an election rally in Haridwar yesterday that BJP had a detailed dossier on the Congress leaders. "Mein Congress ke logon se kehta hoon: jabaan sambhaal kar rakho, warna mere paas aapki poori janampatri padi hui hai (hold your tongue, I have your entire horoscope). Reacting to this comment, Rahul today dared him saying, "You are the Prime Minister for over past two years...You can take out the janmapatri of Congress and go ahead with it." To another comment of Modi that Rahul is the "most joked about person" on Google, the Congress Vice President hit back, saying, "...he likes to search Google and he can do so in his past time...but he has failed in his functions as PM... he will get a jolt from the results of these elections." "(Actually) Modi's policy is that of distraction...when he cannot give answers to issues like employment, security, demonetisation...he indulges in distraction and the whole country knows about it," Rahul said. He said Modi had promised to provide two lakh jobs every year and last year only one lakh youths were provided jobs and this year with the unemployment going high, things are back to square one. "Modi talks about security and terorism... the result of surgical strike has been that some 90 security personnel had to sacrifice their lives first time in seven years," he said. Speaking at the press conference, the UP Chief Minister said emotions and anger were not right as these were elections for growth and prosperity of the state. "Anyone's 'janmpatri' is just a click away in this age of Internet," Akhilesh said, asking the "PM and BJP not to mislead people and come forward and tell them as to what they have given to the state which has elected all prominent NDA leaders". To a question on prominent Muslim clerics like Maulana Ahmed Bukhari and Kalbe Jawwad extending support to BSP, Akhilesh said personal issues should not be manifested at the political level. "One maulana earlier used to seek votes for BJP and is now backing BSP. Is he working towards an alliance between the two parties? As far as the second maulana is concerned you can ask him personally he will give his blessings to the two of us," he said. To a question on whether this alliance will remain intact in the future too, Rahul said, "This is also an alliance of joint vision. We have not come together just for forming a government in UP but also to transform the state." The reality is that the voters understand that the alliance is going to sweep these elections and change Uttar Pradesh, he said. To a question on "lack of coordination" in the alliance, especially on certain seats where both parties are in contest, Rahul said, "On 99 per cent of 403 seats there is no problem and issues are being resolved on the remaining seats...we are fighting elections together...it is wrong to say there is no coordination in alliance." "We want that the government is a set up of youths with a vision...while other parties do not talk about foundation... these 10 points in the joint programme are foundations of development," Rahul stressed. "We also want that the state get a government of all and everyone feels that it is their government...we will help farmers and give jobs to youths," he said. Akhilesh said he was happy with initial voting trend in the first phase of polling. "First votes went to SP-Congress alliance and so the alliance will be ahead," he said. In a dig at BSP chief Mayawati, Akhilesh referred to statues of elephants and stone memorials built in her tenure and said, "Pattharwali sarkar bhi ab development ki baat kar rahi hai...yeh alliance ka impact hai." #Bjp#Bsp#Congress#Manmohan singh#Narendra modi#Newstracker#Rahul gandhi#Samajwadi party#Uttar pradesh#Uttar pradesh assembly election 2017 Also See UP Election 2017: Rahul-Akhilesh slam Narendra Modi over 'ill-planned' demonetisation drive Uttar Pradesh Election 2017: High-voltage campaign for first phase ends on 9 February UP Election 2017: Akhilesh, Rahul release 10-pt common minimum programme UP Election 2017: Akhilesh Yadav, Rahul Gandhi claim 'alliance like Ganga and Yamuna coming together' Top Stories Uttar Pradesh Election 2017 LIVE: Western UP records 45% voter turnout till 2 pm; Mayawati claims BSP will win 1st phase AIADMK Live: Sasikala Enroute to Mahabalipuram to meet 'Captive' MLAs MSG Lion Heart 2 'review': Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh launches another surgical strike on cinema Women scientists in India: What we learnt from a year of lab-hopping across the country Affordable housing emerges as a major beneficiary of Budget 2017 'False rape' cases: Is the feeling of being cheated something that can be explained in our laws?

Yet Chromebooks have defied expectations and made major inroads in an unexpected environment — U.S. schools. In retrospect, that shouldn’t be too surprising. Chromebooks are cheap and easy to manage, making them popular with budget-constrained schools with limited tech-support staff. And Wi-Fi is now common enough in U.S. schools and homes to make an Internet-dependent device practical for students. Google doesn’t want to stop there. It’s releasing new models in partnership with Samsung that are designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers. They have several tablet-like features, including a stylus, touch controls and a 360-degree hinge that allows you to turn the screen faceup. One starts selling Sunday for $449; a more powerful version comes out in April for $100 more. Google and its manufacturing partners are trying to shed the Chromebook’s perception as underperforming budget devices. But even with premium models, expanding beyond U.S. schools won’t be easy. For personal computers and tablets, Chromebook’s share of the U.S. education market was 49 percent last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2013, according to IDC figures released this week. But education accounts for just 14 percent of the 110 million devices shipped in the U.S. last year — and Chromebooks make up just 9 percent of that broader total. Their numbers are also low abroad, even in schools. The Chromebook’s popularity in U.S. education is also largely limited to grades K-12, analysts say. Macs and Windows laptops are still dominant on college campuses. Chromebooks use a lightweight operating system designed to get people online faster, without having to wait around for the computer to start up. Much of the heavy lifting on Chromebooks gets done on Google’s remote servers, so Chromebooks themselves don’t need fast chips or lots of storage. Early on, though, that made Chromebooks seem cheap and underpowered, which “soured consumer expectations right off the bat,” IDC analyst Linn Huang said. Online storage for photos and documents online was much less common in 2011 when Chromebooks launched , so their limited local storage was initially unappealing. And the few apps available for Chromebooks didn’t work offline, at least at the time. But what constrains consumers can actually be liberating in education. Most kids don’t need laptops on the bus or other locations where they can’t connect to Wi-Fi. And they don’t miss business software like Microsoft Office; Google’s online apps for documents and spreadsheets do just fine for homework. “What surprised us was how quickly it took off in education,” said Kan Liu, who oversees Chromebooks at Google. Apple’s iPad was hot at the time, but Google sold the Chromebook on convenience. They’re easier for classrooms to share; just sign in with a Google account, and a student’s apps and documents instantly appear. Teachers also have online tools to lock down what apps and sites students can use. And with models available for less than $200, schools can get a few Chromebooks for the price of an iPad or a rival laptop. “It allows us to put more devices in students’ hands,” said Aaron Slutsky, chief technology officer for McDowell County Schools in North Carolina. But Chromebook’s success story in schools is largely an American one, and it’s likely to stay that way. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa notes that Chromebooks are useless in China because the device depends on Google services that aren’t available there. And in emerging countries, where a budget laptop would be ideal, she said internet access isn’t reliable enough. Even in the U.S., the iPad is better for many creative tasks such as recording and editing movies. Students studying engineering, robotics and graphics won’t be able to use Chromebooks to run the kind of specialized software that’s available for Macs and Windows laptops. “But that’s not needed for 98 percent of our students,” said Tracy Dabbs, coordinator of technology and innovation at the Burlington-­Edison School District near Seattle. Many school districts limit Apple and Windows computers for the students who specifically need them, then provide Chromebooks for the rest. McDowell County, for instance, has 5,500 Chromebooks, 1,200 iPads — and only 100 Macs and 200 Windows PCs. Last year, Apple gave iPads in schools some Chromebook-like features unavailable to the general public. That includes ways to let multiple people use a single tablet and management tools for tech-support staff. A new Classroom app lets teachers control what apps students run and track their progress. Apple also provides classroom tools for teachers and students. Free e-books offer teachers step-by-step guides on using iPad apps and curriculum suggestions for everyday subjects. A separate app lets kids learn programming using the same language developers use to build iPad apps. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced last month new online apps and management tools for schools, along with Windows PCs priced similarly to Chromebooks. Huang said some businesses are giving Chromebooks a second look, especially in retail, banking and other settings where people share computers. But in many offices, the lack of business software such as Office is a major hurdle. Google’s alternative lacks many advanced capabilities found in Office, and habits are hard to change. Google is trying to make Chromebooks more palatable by letting them run Android apps designed for phones and tablets. It’s testing this capability on a handful of Chromebook models, including the new ones from Samsung. That makes it possible to install Office, Adobe Photoshop and many apps on a Chromebook, though these tablet versions have limited features compared with versions for Macs or Windows laptops.

Algorithms: the managers of our digital lives Technology Saturday 11 February 2017 - 9:05am File: Facebook uses algorithms to offer users tailored content. Photo: EPA / Luong Thai Linh PARIS – Algorithms are a crucial cog in the mechanics of our digital world, but also a nosy minder of our personal lives and a subtle, even insidious influence on our behaviour. They have also come to symbolise the risks of a computerised world conditioned by commercial factors. A gift from a Persian scientist  Long before they were associated with Google searches, Facebook pages and Amazon suggestions, algorithms were the brainchild of a Persian scientist. The term is a combination of mediaeval Latin and the name of a ninth century mathematician and astronomer, Al-Khwarizmi, considered the father of algebra. A bit like a kitchen recipe, an algorithm is a series of instructions that allows you to obtain a desired result, according to sociologist Dominique Cardon, who wrote What Algorithms Dream Of. Initially known mainly to mathematicians, the term spread as computers developed. The brains of computer programs are algorithms, and are thus a central cog in the internet machine. Where are algorithms found?  "We are literally surrounded by algorithms," says Olivier Ertzscheid, a French professor of information technology and communication. "Every time you consult Facebook, Google or Twitter you are exposed to choices" that algorithms calculate for us, and we are also sometimes influenced by them, he told AFP. They reign in the finance sector, one example being high frequency trading programs, which can execute trades in milliseconds driven by algorithms that analyse a range of market and economic factors. Their speed and rule-based nature means they can make markets volatile and have triggered so-called flash crashes in the foreign exchange and stock markets. Police forces increasingly use algorithms to predict where and when crimes are most likely to be committed. Predpol, a software program, claims to have contributed to double-digit drops in burglaries, robberies and vehicle theft in several US states and is also used in Kent, southern England. Satellite tracking and surveillance would not have reached the point they are at today without sophisticated algorithms. How Google began  In the 1990s, PageRank (PR) was created in Stanford, California by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google's co-founders. PR made it possible to class web pages by order of popularity. It became the heart of the Google research engine, which responds to key words within a fraction of a second. In addition to PR, Google uses "a dozen algorithms... to deal with spam, detect copyright infractions" and handle other crucial tasks, Ertzscheid explains. Facebook and the 'filter bubble'  Facebook uses sophisticated algorithms to offer its more than 1,8 billion users worldwide personalised content, in particular on its News Feed service which compiles messages from "friends", and shares articles selected according to each users social media contacts. One risk posed by such a system is that of "the filter bubble" according to Eli Pariser, who developed the concept in a book of the same name. Being surrounded by information filtered by algorithms based on one's friends, tastes and previous digital searches and choices, someone surfing the internet can be plunged unwittingly into a "cognitive bubble" that just reinforces their convictions and perspective on the world. Algorithms and the truth  Another risk was exposed during the last US presidential election – the prevalence of so-called fake news or hoaxes on Facebook and other social media. Facebook's algorithms were not designed to distinguish true from false – a feat that is difficult even for artificial intelligence – but the popularity of information. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has sought to deflect criticism that it had been used to fuel the spread of misinformation that may have affected the presidential race, but the company responded to growing criticism by saying new tools would be provided so users could call attention to controversial content. Thinking for us?  Cardon says four main "families" of web algorithms exist. One calculates the popularity of web pages, another assesses their authority within the digital community, and a third evaluates the notoriety of social network users. The fourth attempts to predict the future. This last one is "problematic" for the sociologist, because it tries to anticipate our future behaviour based on clues we have left on the internet in the past. It shows up on Amazon for example as book recommendations based on past purchases. "We build the calculators, but in return they build us" too, Cardon concluded. AFP Comment Now!

(Reuters) In an indirect reply, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday took a jibe at PM Narendra Modi and said that ‘he likes to peep into people’s bathroom and search on Google.’ Congress vice-president’s statement was an indirect reply to PM Modi’s earlier of jibe on Rahul Gandhi for jokes, and Ex-PM Manmohan Singh on scams in UPA regime. The Prime Minister had on Friday said that Rahul is the most joked politician on Google. He asked the crowd to Google the Congress Vice President and find out for themselves the sheer number of jokes on Rahul Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi’s acts have even made senior Congress leaders staying away from the young leader. PM Modi questioned the intelligence of the UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and said that he chose to make an alliance with someone who has managed to keep his own at bay. PM Modi’s “Raincoat” Remark Irks Congress Leaders The Prime Minister further targetted the Samajwadi Party government over the worsening law and order situation in the state. PM Modi questioned the attitude of Akhilesh Yadav over the security of women. Citing the Bulandshahr rape case, where two women had been gang raped in the middle of the day, the PM said that no strict measures were taken by the Chief Minister who had instead blamed the media. He asked the crowd to recall some of the statements made by leaders of the Samajwadi Party. He even targetted Mulayam Singh Yadav over his remarks made on rape a few years ago, where he had said that rapes happen by mistakes and boys would always be boys. Also watch: Taking a dig at ex-PM, PM Modi had said only Manmohan ji known the art of wearing a raincoat while taking a bath. PM Modi made the comments while addressing the Rajya Sabha as a reply to the debate on the motion of thanks to the President’s address. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Now… enhance.” Well, Google just turned this old TV trick into reality 0 Shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Google+Share on LinkedinPin this PostShare on TumblrMore services Tibi Puiu February 8, 2017February 8, 2017 February 8, 2017February 8, 2017 Tibi Puiu An 8×8 pixels source (left) vs. an upscaled version on the right. Credit: Google. Google, your favorite search engine and soon-to-be overlord of all human knowledge, just demonstrated one of the most impressive feats of software engineering. Exploiting the power of neural networks and an unrivaled database of trillions of photos, the Mountain View corporation showed that its possible to render a detailed, higher resolution image from a tiny, pixelated source, some only 8×8 pixels. “Let’s enhance!” It’s a classic moment in TV. Two special agents are gathered in front of a computer screen handled by a brainy technician. Finally, the agents get a glimpse of the suspect on a subway security cam. They instruct the technician to zoom-in on a patch. A pixelated image featured five people comes into focus. ‘Enhance!’ says Special Agent Smith. And they zoom and enhance again and again until they get a clear mugshot. ‘That’s our man’. And it only took 30 seconds. Kudos to law enforcement! Problem is, in real life, you can’t do this as it would imply extracting more information from a limited source. Of course, there are plenty of image enhancing algorithms that do a pretty good job cleaning up blurry or grainy images. This sort of approach fills in the blanks so to speak but if your zoomed-in source is only a couple pixels wide there’s nothing you can do. Google used a nifty trick, though, as you can notice in the image below. The first column is made of 8×8 sources, the middle column shows the images Google Brain was able to create from the pixelated source, and the third column shows the ‘ground truth’ or real depiction of what the 8×8 sources were to look like if they had been in higher resolution. Credit: Google. Advertisement The way Google Brain handles this task is it first compares the 64-pixel source with other higher resolution images which were downsized to the same 8×8 grid. This is the conditioning neural network. The prior neural network then upscales and compares the 8×8 source against many real high-res images of celebrities and bedrooms, for this case study at least. The network then adds new pixels one by one in a way that matches what the machine already knows. In the case of an 8×8 block, a brown pixel on the far right and far left would correspond to eyebrows. When the image is scaled to 32×32, the blanks are filled with pixels that depict an eyebrow. The final image combines both conditioning and prior networks. Credit: Google. The resulting constructed (fake) images managed to fool quite a few people in tests that these were actually real images. Upscaled images of celebrities fooled 10 percent of human participants that these were genuine, where 50 percent would imply a perfect score. The bedroom images fooled 28 percent of humans. Bicubic scaling, a method that interpolates data points on a two-dimensional regular grid, didn’t manage to fool anyone. That being said, the upscaled images made by Google Brain are fake. This is important to consider, else we might fall for it just like on TV. The upscaled images are educated guesses at best because, again, you can’t create more information from limited information. Some hunches are spot on, though, as evident in these press photos. Another consideration is that the networks knew they had to find a photo of a celebrity or bedroom which made the job a lot easier. Police investigations and forensic scientists could make use of such a software, however, it would never stand in court. Rather, the “zoom-in, enhance” capability could offer a lead where there’s none to begin with. For now, at least, Google has no plans on turning this sandbox research project into something useful. via Ars Technica Like us on Facebook The future is now! Join the newsletter and learn why.

Phones by Jessica Dolcourt February 7, 2017 11:15 AM PST @jdolcourt My AI is smarter than your AI. That's the taunt that Samsung Galaxy S8 owners may be able to lob at Google Pixel users if the S8's rumored Bixby Assistant launches with seven or eight languages, as reported by SamMobile. Enlarge Image Samsung's Bixby AI will go after Google Assistant, Apple's Siri and Amazon Alexa for phones CNET In the Google Pixel, Assistant currently supports two languages, according to Google's website: English and German. The Google Allo app, which also uses Google Assistant and works on more phones, supports five languages: English, German, Hindi, Japanese and Portuguese. (You can still use Google's voice search/Google Now with many more languages on the Pixel phones, but the Google Assistant launch gesture turns off when you switch your primary language to, say, Spanish.) Launching its own smart AI assistant is an important move for Samsung and its future Galaxy and Note phones. The company, which strives to dominate the smartphone world against Apple's iPhone, stands to win fans if its Bixby assistant can outperform Google's Assistant, Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, which will land on its first phone later this month. This isn't the first time that Samsung has tried to out-Google Google either. The company hoped to supplant Google's voice search tool with Samsung's branded S Voice app, and introduced other software services of its own. The company has largely pulled back on preloaded apps and shuttered some of the services, so it'll be interesting to see how well Bixby AI will be able to compete with more established assistants, especially in these early days of AI on phones. Samsung's 'Bixby' assistant may have its own button on Galaxy S8 Reports suggest that Samsung could reveal is own AI in the upcoming Galaxy S8 phone -- although that phone may be delayed, considering the troubles with the Note 7. by Bridget Carey 1:55 Close Drag Bixby is rumored to: Handle payments Control native apps Identify object and text through the camera app Feature its own launch button The Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to launch March 29 and sell in mid-April.

Internet Services by Sean Hollister February 7, 2017 12:44 PM PST @starfire2258 This, my friends, this glorious TV and movie trope, may be coming true. The ability to "zoom and enhance" an image, one that's far too low-res for humans to understand, is now way, way closer thanks to a team of AI researchers at Google. Behold: Enlarge Image Google At left, the crummy low-res image the computer had to work with. At right, the actual photo. And in the center... a human that bears a passing resemblance to the real photo! Enlarge Image The four rightmost columns show how the same low-res image can be interpreted in very different ways. Google So, how did it do that? Google's Brain research team trained a pair of neural networks to do it all by themselves, by feeding them images of celebrity faces (and for a later test, bedrooms). One network was responsible for figuring out how the pixels might turn into a higher-res image, while the second added fine details, each network working with what it "knew" about celebrities (or bedrooms) having analyzed lots of similar pictures. No, it's not remotely close enough to identify an exact person -- and remember, the computer is imagining the details, not magically extracting them. Still, it could be another tool (like a police artist's sketch) to help detectives ID their suspect. Perhaps it could help agencies get more value out of satellite images, too. And it looks like it could work with source material that's far lower-res than the Boston Marathon Bombing footage from 2013 -- where Carnegie Mellon University's CyLab demonstrated a similar "super resolution" technique. Unfortunately, a Google rep tells us this was a "one-off research exploration," and has no current plans to use it. It's also probably worth noting that Google's computers knew that they were looking at faces (or bedrooms) to begin with. You can read much, much more about precisely how the Google technique works (and how it fooled 11 percent of humans, which Google's researchers claim is a remarkably high number) in the PDF document below.

This is a large but incremental update to Android 5.0. We’ve been testing the developer preview for months, and now it’s finally ready for prime-time. Below are a few instructions to install it right now, rather than waiting for the slow update process to complete. Advertisement Last week Google promised Android 6.0 would be available next week, and apparently they meant right at 9AM Monday morning, because it’s now readily available for the Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 7 (2013), Nexus 9, and the Nexus Player. Those on the developer preview 1, 2, or 3 will get an over the air update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Read: Nexus Android 6.0 Update: What to Expect However, updates like this don’t arrive to everyone at the same time. In fact, Google rolls them out in slow waves starting with 20% of users, then 30-50%, then up to 80% and eventually everyone within two weeks. Instead of waiting, we’ll show you how to enjoy it right now. The Android 6.0 Marshmallow System Image is a download that contains all the files needed to install a stock version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow on the above mentioned devices. This is essentially everything that you would download as an OTA update for regular Android updates. Read on for all the details. With Android 6.0 Marshmallow users will enjoy a variety of new features, improvements to battery life with a feature called Doze that promises nearly 30% increased standby time, especially with tablets. Not to mention Android Pay, native fingerprint support, multi-window mode, Google Now on Tap, USB Type-C ports, new volume controls, security enhancements and overall better performance. There is a lot going on behind the scenes, and only a few visual changes, but this is still a major update that all owners will want as soon as possible. Advertisement Now that the factory images are official, manufacturers will start building updates for smartphones like the Moto X, LG G4, Galaxy S6 or Note 5 and hundreds of others. If you have a Nexus smartphone or tablet, you will get it this week, but can install it right now with the instructions below. Proceed at your own risk. Read: Android M vs Android 5.1: What’s New So Far This guide will show you how to install the final Nexus Android 6.0 Marshmallow software. This is something you can do from Windows, Mac, Linux or ChromeOS. There are multiple ways this can be done, and lots of things that can go wrong, but below are the easiest steps without spending hours setting up all of Google’s developer software. How to Install ADB on Windows, Mac, Ubuntu & ChromeOS Before you can install Android 6.0 Marshmallow on the Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 9 or others you will need to install ADB and Fastboot to your computer. This is a program that runs on your PC/Mac to connect to your Android device through a USB cable and flash the Android software to your device. Installing ADB and Fastboot is one of the most difficult parts of installing Android factory images, but several simple tools make it incredibly easy. Our tools below bypass all the trouble and streamline the process. Advertisement How to Install ADB on Windows If you are using a Windows machine, including up to Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 you can use the 15 second adb installer to streamline the process. Download the ADB installer for Windows. Find the file, right-click on it and choose Run as Administrator. When prompted you need to give the app access to run as an administrator. After the app launches type a Y and enter to select yes to Install ADB & Fastboot, to intsll ADB/Fastboot systemwide and to install Drivers. When a new window pops up follow the steps to install the drivers. After this is installed you should be ready to install the Android 6.0 on a supported Nexus device. How to Install ADB on Mac, Linux & ChromeOS Nexus Tools makes it easy to install ADB on a Mac, Linux or even ChromeOS. All you need to do is open Terminal on your computer and past in the code from xda. Open terminal by going to search, and simply typing Terminal and opening the program. Advertisement This will install ADB and Fastboot on Mac, Linux and Chrome OS without the need to do anything else. It’s extremely easy, and avoids all the ADB package mess that typically takes hours to complete. After the script completes you can type ADB or Fastboot to start running either program. This is where you’ll need to be to flash the new Android 6.0 system images provided by Google onto your device. Remember to head into settings > developer options and enable USB Debugging first. How to Install Android 6.0 Marshmallow Right Now The first thing you need to do is download the just released Android 6.0 Marshmallow System Image (Factory image) for your device. You can find them at the links below. You’ll have to agree to the terms, and then proceed. Make sure you download the right one, especially for mobile tablets. Nexus 5 Android 6.0 Marshmallow Update Nexus 6 Android 6.0 Marshmallow Update Nexus 7 Android 6.0 Marshmallow Update (Mobile version) Nexus 9 Android 6.0 Marshmallow Update (LTE version) You will need to unzip these files to a folder you can access, we just unzipped it to our Mac desktop. After you have the Android 6.0 system image unzipped you will need to find this folder and type cmd into the address bar on Windows, or open terminal and change the folder to this folder on Mac, Linux or Chrome OS. Reminder, if you’re on a MAC you need to make sure terminal is running inside the folder you just unzipped. Advertisement If your Nexus is not bootloader unlocked you should do that first. We could not install any Android M images and update with the device locked. This will wipe your device and erase all user data, settings, pictures, etc. Repeat, this will erase everything! Open a Terminal in the adb folder and type the command below then hit enter. adb reboot bootloader In Fastboot type: fastboot oem unlock Then hit enter. Follow the on-screen instructions and choose to erase the device. Wait a minute or so for it to unlock. This removes everything on your device. Flash Android 6.0 Marshmallow Images Now open the folder containing the unzipped Android 6.0 Marshmallow System Image file you just downloaded. Type cmd in the address bar. Type the following commands posted below and hit enter. On a Mac you can open Terminal in the folder by enabling terminal shortcuts in settings. This is key for Mac users. Head to System Preferences and select Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services. Find “New Terminal at Folder” in the settings and click the box. Now when you’re in Finder, just right-click a folder and you’re shown the open to open Terminal. Or just do it from the desktop where you unzipped the Factory image as shown below. Once in terminal simply copy and paste the commands below to install Android 6.0 to your Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 7, Nexus 9, or even the Nexus Player. flash-all.bat This will flash all of the needed files. If you are on a Mac or other computer you will need to type; sudo ./flash-all.sh This will push all of the files and update your device to the just released Android 6.0 Marshmallow final software. The files will start pushing and installing and your Nexus device may reboot and you will see an Android figure and then a moving Android logo. The logo screen may stay for a long time. Don’t unplug the device. You may run into an issue, which we did and will explain below. Read: Android 5.0 Tap N Go Restores Your Phone in Minutes Update: Many users may experience a “missing system.img” error and the installation will be aborted. This is because the way you’re trying to flash the update. Instructions on how to get around this can be found right here. Essentially users will need to unzip the update.zip folder and move all the images to the original folder we mentioned above, then manually flash them one by one starting with the bootloader, then the radio, vs the flash-all command mentioned above. Only do this if you run into issues. When the process finishes you can enter your information or Gmail account and start using Android 6.0 Marshmallow right now on Nexus smartphones and the Nexus 9 tablet. Give Google’s Tap n Go (automatically restore) a try using NFC to automatically restore and all apps, settings, accounts and more from another device. Then we’d recommend long-pressing the home bottom to turn on Google Now on Tap, which is one of Android 6.0’s best new features. For those who’d rather not mess with this scary stuff, we’re expecting the official Android 6.0 update to start rolling out over the air today, and through the next week or so. Google promised a 3rd quarter release date for Nexus smartphones and tablets, and that time-frame ended a few days ago. Google confirmed the updates would start this week, so stay tuned for an over the air update notification, accept it, and enjoy the latest software. For now this is the fastest way to get Google’s new Android 6.0 release, but updates shouldn’t be far behind. Those who’d rather not wait can try the steps above, or sit tight for just a little bit longer. Then hopefully all major manufacturers can deliver software updates for their devices before the end of the year as well. 18 Responses 10/05/2015 Cory Gunther Reply I got a lot of errors, but appears to have flashed just fine.

By India Ashok February 11, 2017 06:38 GMT Some journalists suspect that the state-sponsored hackers could be Russians, looking to access incriminating emails which could be used against themiStock Google has reportedly warned numerous prominent journalists that they have become the latest targets of state-sponsored hackers, intent on stealing email account passwords to access sensitive material. Journalists at New York Times, The Atlantic, Vox and CNN are among those who were warned of the cyberthreat against them by the tech giant, according to reports. Some of the journalists who have received Google's warnings suspect that the state-sponsored hackers could be Russians, looking to access incriminating emails which could be used against them and the American media, according to a report by Politico. "The fact that all this started right after the election suggests to me that journalists are the next wave to be targeted by state-sponsored hackers in the way that Democrats were during it," said one journalist who got the warning. "I worry that the outcome is going to be the same: Someone, somewhere, is going to get hacked, and then the contents of their gmail will be weaponized against them — and by extension all media." A Google spokesperson said, "Since 2012, we've notified users when we believe their Google accounts are being targeted by government-backed attackers. We send these warnings out of an abundance of caution — they do not indicate that a user's account has already been compromised or that a more widespread attack is occurring when they receive the notice." Jonathan Chait of New York Magazine, Julia Ioffe from The Atlantic, Ezra Klein, the founder of Vox,CNN senior media reporter Brian Stelter, New York Times national security correspondent David Sanger, Times columnist Paul Krugman and Yahoo Washington bureau chief Garance Franke-Ruta, are among those who confirmed having recently received Google's warning. GQ special contributor Keith Olbermann claimed that he began receiving the warnings shortly after the election. Chait claimed that he was "contacted over email by a stranger who offered to help me by giving me an encryption key to protect me from hackers. He would not give me his name, meet me or talk on the phone, despite repeated requests." The same stranger is also believed to have contacted four reporters with The Atlantic - David Frum, James Fallows and Adam Serwer, Andrew Sullivan – as well as Ars Technica's Dan Goodin. Stanford professor Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Russia said that he too received warnings from Google. "Given my background, one would have to guess that it's the Russians."

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Cast Your Smartphone’s VR Experience to Your TV Thanks to smartphones, Virtual Reality has come a long way over the past year or two. But VR is really only cool for the person actually using it at the time. Want your friends to see what you see? is You can share your screen with those around you, as long as you have a Chromecast (for Android devices) or Apple TV (for iOS devices). What You Need Before we get started, let’s talk about compatibility. I tested this method on Samsung Gear VR with the Galaxy S7 Edge, Google Cardboard with the Nexus 5, Google Cardboard with the iPhone 5S, and Google Daydream with the Pixel XL. It work flawlessly with Cardboard and Daydream on both Android and iOS, but Gear VR was hit and miss—some things would show up on the cast device, others would just display a generic “Gear VR” screen and nothing else. So, basically, your mileage may vary. Fortunately, it’s easy to test out, so you’re not really giving up anything by trying. Okay, with that out of the way, here’s what you’ll need to get started: A VR headset for your smartphone: Google Daydream or Cardboard are preferred, Gear VR may work A smartphone compatible phone with your VR headset of choice The Google Home app on Android devices A Chromecast (for Android devices) or Apple TV (for iOS devices) If you already have all this stuff, then you’re ready to go. But first, a few details on what to expect here. First off, this won’t show things exactly as you seem them through your headset—VR works by showing two similar images on each half of the display, which is translated to a single 3D image when you watch it through the viewer. Since the TV is only showing exactly what’s on the phone’s screen, it will show up as those two individual images. So, while it doesn’t share exactly what you’re seeing as as ingle image, it still gives other people an idea of what’s going on as they follow along. It’s not perfect, but it’s still better than just trying to explain what’s happening. How to Cast Your VR Experience with Android and Chromecast If you have an Android device and VR headset—be it Samsung Gear VR, Cardboard, Daydream, or some other option—the process is the same across the board. The first thing you’ll need to do is make sure your respective devices are set up and connected to the same Wi-Fi network. The first time you open the companion app, it’ll walk you through the set up process, which will be different for each type of unit. Go ahead and install the Google Home app if you don’t already have it—this is the app used to manager Chromecasts, Android TV boxes, and Google Home units on your network. If you’ve used your Chromecast or Android TV before, chances are you already have this installed. Then open the Home app’s menu buy sliding in from the left side. From there, choose “Cast screen/audio.” This will bring up the screen casting page—just tap the “Cast Screen/Audio” button at the bottom, then select your cast device. At that point, everything that happens on your phone’s screen will show up on the TV. If you’re using Cardboard, go ahead and open the Cardboard app at this point and select an app from your library. Otherwise, toss your phone into its VR headset and its app should automatically launch. From there, just move forward like normal—everything will work as it always has, except everything that happens on your phone will also show up on the TV. How to Share your VR Experience with an iOS Device and Apple TV Since screen sharing to Chromecast isn’t supported in iOS, you’ll need an Apple TV to broadcast your VR experience from your iPhone. First, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the Control Center, then select “AirPlay Mirroring.” Select your Apple TV. Just like with Android and Chromecast, everything that happens on your phone from this point forward will show up on the TV. I’m testing this with Google Cardboard, but the process should be the same (or very similar) regardless of what headset you’re using. I can’t speak for all of them, however, so be aware that your mileage may vary. At this point you can go ahead and open your VR viewer’s companion application, launch a VR app, and then drop the phone into the viewer. From there, just do your thing. As I said earlier, this isn’t a perfect solution. Ideally, you’d be able to share a single image to the TV, but unfortunately that’s just not how it works and there’s no easy solution to doing so. Until something like that becomes available, this is the next best thing—at least you get to show other people what’s going on, which is half the fun.

Algorithms The complex mathematical formulas are playing a growing role in all walks of life: from detecting skin cancers to suggesting new Facebook friends, deciding who gets a job, how police resources are deployed, who gets insurance at what cost, or who is on a "no fly" list. World Bulletin / News Desk Algorithms are a crucial cog in the mechanics of our digital world, but also a nosy minder of our personal lives and a subtle, even insidious influence on our behaviour. They have also come to symbolise the risks of a computerised world conditioned by commercial factors.  A gift from a Persian scientist   Long before they were associated with Google searches, Facebook pages and Amazon suggestions, algorithms were the brainchild of a Persian scientist. The term is a combination of mediaeval Latin and the name of a ninth century mathematician and astronomer, Al-Khwarizmi, considered the father of algebra. A bit like a kitchen recipe, an algorithm is a series of instructions that allows you to obtain a desired result, according to sociologist Dominique Cardon, who wrote "What Algorithms Dream Of". Initially known mainly to mathematicians, the term spread as computers developed.  The brains of computer programmes are algorithms, and are thus a central cog in the internet machine.  Where are algorithms found?   "We are literally surrounded by algorithms," says Olivier Ertzscheid, a French professor of information technology and communication. "Every time you consult Facebook, Google or Twitter you are exposed to choices" that algorithms calculate for us, and we are also sometimes influenced by them, he told AFP. They reign in the finance sector, one example being high frequency trading programmes, which can execute trades in milliseconds driven by algorithms that analyze a range of market and economic factors. Their speed and rule-based nature means they can make markets volatile and have triggered so-called flash crashes in the foreign exchange and stock markets.  Police forces increasingly use algorithms to predict where and when crimes are most likely to be committed. Predpol, a software programme, claims to have contributed to double-digit drops in burglaries, robberies and vehicle theft in several US states and is also used in Kent, southern England. Satellite tracking and surveillance would not have reached the point they are at today without sophisticated algorithms.   How Google began   In the 1990s, PageRank (PR) was created in Stanford, California by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google's co-founders. PR made it possible to class web pages by order of popularity. It became the heart of the Google research engine, which responds to key words within a fraction of a second. In addition to PR, Google uses "a dozen algorithms... to deal with spam, detect copyright infractions" and handle other crucial tasks, Ertzscheid explains.  Facebook and the 'filter bubble'   Facebook uses sophisticated algorithms to offer its more than 1.8 billion users worldwide personalised content, in particular on its News Feed service which compiles messages from "friends", and shares articles selected according to each users social media contacts. One risk posed by such a system is that of "The Filter Bubble" according to Eli Pariser, who developed the concept in a book of the same name. Being surrounded by information filtered by algorithms based on one's friends, tastes and previous digital searches and choices, someone surfing the internet can be plunged unwittingly into a "cognitive bubble" that just reinforces their convictions and perspective on the world.  Algorithms and the truth   Another risk was exposed during the last US presidential election -- the prevalence of so-called fake news or hoaxes on Facebook and other social media. Facebook's algorithms were not designed to distinguish true from false -- a feat that is difficult even for artificial intelligence -- but the popularity of information. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has sought to deflect criticism that it had been used to fuel the spread of misinformation that may have impacted the presidential race, but the company responded to growing criticism by saying new tools would be provided so users could call attention to controversial content. Market crises link? They are agnostic on market direction, but ubiquitous in markets. Firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley may get the headlines, but algorithms are the real force today on Wall Street. The mysterious programs were at the center of the so-called "Flash Crash" in May 2010, when the US stock market plunged more than nine percent in a matter of minutes for no discernible reason. The swoon, which was reversed within a matter of minutes, was sparked by a computerized order to sell a large quantity of S&P 500 futures in a short period. That, in turn, triggered a chain reaction of other computerized orders by high-frequency traders. The quickfire crash and recovery underscored the pivotal role of algorithms, which execute automated trades after taking instantaneous readings of inputs that can include news events, economic data and stock price movements. The era of automated trading began with the 1971 founding of the Nasdaq market, which introduced computers to Wall Street in a significant way. Today, algorithms are the 900-pound gorilla in markets, playing a role in the vast majority of securities transactions. "I would say it is 90 percent algorithmic, but there is not a great way to quantify that," said Valerie Bogard, an equity analyst at Tabb Group, a research and consulting firm. "Even though (people) may send an order through a sales desk, it is possible it is going through an algo." The Securities and Exchange Commission in 2014 levied its first fine for such bogus trades. Since then, US regulators have pumped more resources into enforcing the rules on electronic trading. The SEC now requires firms to identify those who design and operate algorithms and can subpoena documents from firms employing the technology. There has also been a preference among some investors to rein in the machines. The New York Stock Exchange has announced plans to slow down transactions in one of its platforms, following the introduction of a similar mechanism by IEX Group, which delays transactions by microseconds. These moves were taken in response to criticism that high-frequency traders were stiffing investors by driving up transaction costs.  But market insiders say there is no evidence of a clear trend as far as whether high-frequency trading makes the market more prone to crises than with conventional trading. After all, markets were also prone to violent gyrations prior to when the machines took over. "When the crash in 1987 happened, it was before algos," said Noll. "It is a somewhat harsh reality but true."         Legal Notice: Copyright, trade marks and other intellectual property rights in this website can not be reproduced without the prior permission.

German Commerzbank profits plunge in 2016 The bank's 279 million euros ($298 million) net profit beat the 222 million forecast by analysts surveyed by Factset, but fell far short of the almost 1.1-billion-euro result it reported in 2015.

Everyone was reeling from the photographs of the vapourisation of Hiroshima. It was thought that atomic war would wipe out everyone on earth. This almost happened when I was a young man, culminating in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis which the top page of Google informs us was a     “direct and dangerous confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.” I didn’t need to go to Google to find this out. It was a defining moment in my life, and the lives of my friends. Women then were refusing to have children because they didn’t want them to live in a world of fear and probable atomisation. The Doomsday clock about nuclear annihilation, is a simple illustration of the fact that life on Earth had been around for billions of years but that Clever Old Man had developed a system that could switch it off with an hour-long firework extravaganza. Now it has been extended to global warming, virus pandemics, and more or less anything that the media have decided makes a good story. The clock has been advanced to two and a half minutes to midnight. By Scientists. Let’s think about this a bit. Added to all this is the US abandonment of the arms limitation agreements and the re-investment in missile development. We see NATO creeping closer to Russia, and the absurd attempts by the US to bring Ukraine into the operation. Is this why the clock has been moved? No. It is Donald Trump. On the top page of Google (again) we see that     the Guardian, Telegraph      and ‘Science’ blame the movement of the clock hands on the election of Mr Trump. ABC seems to think it is global warming. But global warming, even in worst case scenarios (and I have myself followed this and made my own calculations) wont wipe out life on Earth, except indirectly by creating resource wars which might go nuclear. And a virus pandemic would always have some survivors. Total nuclear exchange would not: so that is what we are dealing with. It is a very real possibility. But not because of Donald Trump. What I see in the election of Trump, and in Brexit also, is a spontaneous creation of civil society, in countries which have seen their lives ruined by globalisation and what has been called ‘the new world order’. What I see in Mr Trump is an independent flamboyant showman, along the lines of an earlier US President Andrew Jackson, a man who also despised and tried to destroy the US establishment. I have a lot of time for people like this, being a version myself; I watched the media system doing their uttermost to paint Trump as a madman. Trump clearly thinks outside the system of smoke and mirrors that passes for western media news, the constructions on the web and TV and newspapers which are increasingly spun and slanted with nonsense and demonstrable lies about the state of the world. Finally: one thing. The real Doomsday clock passed midnight long ago. The mad race to extinction fuelled by the market-forces laissez faire western system created a monster: a system which is not really controlled by anyone, but drives itself with only one imperative-to become richer and more powerful, so as to become richer and more powerful. The monster has no soul; it was not constructed to look after life on the planet. Following nuclear fallout, and nuclear energy accidents, Depleted Uranium, and now fracking, background radioactivity continuously increases. The fertility rate is falling. IVF is advancing. Cancer is an epidemic in real terms. This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang but a whimper.   This article has been excerpted from: ‘Beware the Trumpocalypse!

Yet Chromebooks have defied expectations and made major inroads in an unexpected environment – U.S. schools. In retrospect, that shouldn’t be too surprising. Chromebooks are cheap and easy to manage, making them popular with budget-constrained schools with limited tech-support staff. And Wi-Fi is now common enough in U.S. schools and homes to make an internet-dependent device practical for students. Google doesn’t want to stop there. It’s releasing new models in partnership with Samsung that are designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers. They have several tablet-like features, including a stylus, touch controls and a 360-degree hinge that allows you to turn the screen faceup. One starts selling Sunday for $449; a more powerful version comes out in April for $100 more. Google and its manufacturing partners are trying to shed the Chromebook’s perception as underperforming budget devices. But even with premium models, expanding beyond U.S. schools won’t be easy. Chromebooks get schooled For personal computers and tablets, Chromebook’s share of the U.S. education market was 49 percent last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and 9 percent in 2013, according to IDC figures released this week. But education accounts for just 14 percent of the 110 million devices shipped in the U.S. last year – and Chromebooks make up just 9 percent of that broader total. Their numbers are also low abroad, even in schools. The Chromebook’s popularity in U.S. education is also largely limited to grades K-12, analysts say. Macs and Windows laptops are still dominant on college campuses. Rough start Chromebooks use a lightweight operating system designed to get people online faster, without having to wait around for the computer to start up. Much of the heavy lifting on Chromebooks gets done on Google’s remote servers, so Chromebooks themselves don’t need fast chips or lots of storage. Early on, though, that made Chromebooks seem cheap and underpowered, which “soured consumer expectations right off the bat,” IDC analyst Linn Huang said. Online storage for photos and documents online was much less common in 2011 when Chromebooks launched, so their limited local storage was initially unappealing. And the few apps available for Chromebooks didn’t work offline, at least at the time. Differing needs But what constrains consumers can actually be liberating in education. Most kids don’t need laptops on the bus or other locations where they can’t connect to Wi-Fi. And they don’t miss business software like Microsoft Office; Google’s online apps for documents and spreadsheets do just fine for homework. “What surprised us was how quickly it took off in education,” said Kan Liu, who oversees Chromebooks at Google. Apple’s iPad was hot at the time, but Google sold the Chromebook on convenience. They’re easier for classrooms to share; just sign in with a Google account, and a student’s apps and documents instantly appear. Teachers also have online tools to lock down what apps and sites students can use. And with models available for less than $200, schools can get a few Chromebooks for the price of an iPad or a rival laptop. “It allows us to put more devices in students’ hands,” said Aaron Slutsky, chief technology officer for McDowell County Schools in North Carolina. Far from universal But Chromebook’s success story in schools is largely an American one, and it’s likely to stay that way. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa notes that Chromebooks are useless in China because the device depends on Google services that aren’t available there. And in emerging countries, where a budget laptop would be ideal, she said internet access isn’t reliable enough. Even in the U.S., the iPad is better for many creative tasks such as recording and editing movies. Students studying engineering, robotics and graphics won’t be able to use Chromebooks to run the kind of specialized software that’s available for Macs and Windows laptops. “But that’s not needed for 98 percent of our students,” said Tracy Dabbs, coordinator of technology and innovation at the Burlington-Edison School District near Seattle. Many school districts limit Apple and Windows computers for the students who specifically need them, then provide Chromebooks for the rest. McDowell County, for instance, has 5,500 Chromebooks, 1,200 iPads – and only 100 Macs and 200 Windows PCs. Rivals stage comeback Last year, Apple gave iPads in schools some Chromebook-like features unavailable to the general public. That includes ways to let multiple people use a single tablet and management tools for tech-support staff. A new Classroom app lets teachers control what apps students run and track their progress. Apple also provides classroom tools for teachers and students. Free e-books offer teachers step-by-step guides on using iPad apps and curriculum suggestions for everyday subjects. A separate app lets kids learn programming using the same language developers use to build iPad apps. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced last month new online apps and management tools for schools, along with Windows PCs priced similarly to Chromebooks. Beyond schools Huang said some businesses are giving Chromebooks a second look, especially in retail, banking and other settings where people share computers. But in many offices, the lack of business software such as Office is a major hurdle. Google’s alternative lacks many advanced capabilities found in Office, and habits are hard to change. Google is trying to make Chromebooks more palatable by letting them run Android apps designed for phones and tablets. It’s testing this capability on a handful of Chromebook models, including the new ones from Samsung. That makes it possible to install Office, Adobe Photoshop and many apps on a Chromebook, though these tablet versions have limited features compared with versions for Macs or Windows laptops.

To succeed in today’s e-market, it has become vital to have an immense knowledge of digital marketing. Digital marketing can do wonders to any traditional marketing campaign, boosting its reach, value, and ability to build brand awareness. From here comes Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), which can help retailers expand their market size and reach more customers. SEO has now evolved and has become essential for every successful online business. Here, in this article, we will tell you some exclusive SEO hacks that could help you take your online business to new heights. 1. Technical aspects of SEO From the very beginning, you need to take care of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Firstly, you need to check your robots.txt file and robots META tags. Both of these are employed to limit Google’s access to certain files. Sometimes, your website may contain certain web pages that are present on that list. The architecture of your site and XML sheet should be perfect. All the content you wish to manifest on your site should be accessible by Google. You should also conduct a regular audit of your site to make your site free from such files. 2. Blogs and impressive content Impressive content never fails to attract the audience. You can write articles related to the products you sell online. For instance, if you are selling electronics items, then you can probably write articles on best smartphones to buy under $400 or best laptops for students. Your content should be informative, pertinent and exclusive. It should be easy to understand and plagiarism free. You can also add graphs, infographics, images and relevant data to your content as these may increase viewership. You should be aware of content marketing and content promotion strategies and must focus on building the links in your blogs. Further, you can also invite professionals from other industries to share your content link on their site, as their expert knowledge in a specific niche can make your site more credible. Backlinks and link building strategy, indeed, improves the ranking of your page on Google. 3. Videos Videos not only help to gain the attention of the audience but they also keep the audience engaged and entertained. Not only this, videos improve the ranking of your page on SERPs. These videos can be shared by others as well on their websites, which in turn will direct the traffic to your site. 4. Keywords A keyword or keywords are basically what the users type in a search engine to search for the desired information or content. Your content must contain these keywords as they improve the ranking of your website, and hence, increase the traffic. A simple example of a keyword is like if you wish to sell books for IELTS preparation, then your article or product description must contain the terms such as IELTS, aspirants, books, preparation, etc. But do not overuse them, as it may produce undesirable results. You can use various forums and social hubs to know how to find the important keywords relating a particular topic. 5. Email campaigns Email campaigns always help you to build cordial relationships with the client. If a customer visits your site, you can ask him/her to fill his/her basic details and subscribe to your site. Once it is done, then you can send the details of various products available on your site through emails. Further, you can also send them the informative articles relevant to the product or service you wish to provide. 6. Mobile optimisation In today’s era, people search the content on the web while traveling, eating and most importantly when in a classroom. So it becomes crucial for your site to be mobile friendly. A recent stats state that 4 out of 5 users use smartphones for online shopping.[1] So assure that mobile optimization finds a prominent place in your SEO hacks list. 7. Social Media You can also advertise your products on social media platforms. When you do this, make sure that a click on the link to your site always directs the user to the landing page wherein user can give his personal details and not to the homepage. Also, add social sharing buttons to your site that enables the users to share an article or a product on various platforms. So, these are some of the easy but most important SEO hacks that you must know before establishing an online business. There are many other tricks that include having an Android app for the site so so users can easily surf through the content of the site via mobile. That indeed will attract a lot of users. With the aid of all these SEO strategies, we hope that you are ready to rock the world of e-commerce.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Review Review: Samsung’s Chromebook Pro will change the way you look at Chrome Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Zach Epstein @zacharye February 10th, 2017 at 9:00 AM Share Tweet Taking over the world isn’t easy, but Google is well on its way. The company’s Android platform is still in its infancy in the grand scheme of things, and yet smart thinking on Google’s part caused adoption to skyrocket in no time at all. By making Android open source and offering it to hardware vendors for free (with important strings attached), Google made the decision all too easy for companies like Samsung, HTC and Motorola, which all needed a fresh new platform to enter the smartphone market. After all, it was becoming increasingly obvious that industry leaders like Nokia and BlackBerry were doomed. And why build your own platform when you can use Android for free? The goal for Google, of course, is to put its various products and services in front of as many eyeballs as possible, and to make it as easy as possible to access and use them. The more often people use Google services, the more data Google can collect and the more ads Google can display. The company is doing great things, of that there is no question, but Google is a business and selling ads is how it stays in business. With the smartphone market covered, Google has expanded its presence in other key markets. Android TV, Android Wear, and Google’s work with IoT devices are all examples of the company’s efforts to widen its reach. And then there’s Chrome, which continues to be dismissed by some industry watchers despite having made tremendous gains in recent years; despite the overall decline in the PC market last year, Chromebook shipments climbed 20%. The majority of Chromebook gains have come in the education and low-end consumer markets, where cost among the biggest factors that contribute to purchase decisions. But Google and its partners will have to address other markets as well if Chrome is to become a major player in the market. Don't Miss: Is this the perfect Android phone? It’s easy to dismiss Chrome OS. Windows is massive! Windows is too big to fail! Windows will be the world’s go-to desktop computing for decades to come! Of course, those of us who have been covering consumer tech for as long as I have can remember when the exact same things were said about Symbian, Windows Mobile and BlackBerry OS. In fact, Nokia executives used to laugh at me in 2007 and 2008 when I asked them how they planned to adapt to the shifting smartphone market. I don’t imagine any of those executives are laughing anymore. Now, this isn’t to say that Windows is a doomed platform — at least, not anytime soon. But to state things mildly, the future does not look terribly bright for Windows at the moment. Market research firm IDC estimates that 428.5 million smartphones shipped in the fourth quarter alone last year, with the overwhelming majority of those phones having been powered by Android. Meanwhile, IDC says that a total of 260.2 million PCs shipped in all of 2016. Even though Microsoft currently owns more than 90% of the PC market according to Net Applications, Android user numbers have continued to grow while PC shipments decline. So, what happens years from now when all these Android users have the option to buy a new Windows PC, or a new Chrome OS computer that gives them tighter integration with their phones and access to all the same apps and services they enjoy on other devices, in addition to desktop-grade apps? Of course, Android apps themselves will likely be “desktop-grade” by then, but the point is Microsoft’s advantages with Windows have been dwindling slowly over the past decade, and it looks like the pace may soon accelerate. Especially when you add Chrome devices like the new Samsung Chromebook Pro into the mix. First, a few thoughts on Chrome OS, which shares a name with Google’s wildly popular cross-platform web browser. This is apropos, as anyone who has used a Chrome computer will tell you, because the operating system itself looks and feels very similar to Chrome for Windows or Mac, and the Chrome browser is the focal point of Chrome OS. The best way to describe Chrome OS may be to call it something of a hybrid between the Chrome desktop browser and the Android platform. The user interface will feel quite familiar to anyone with an Android smartphone, because it utilizes the same Material Design elements as Android. Out of the box, however, most functions happen in the browser (even in offline mode). Upon powering up a Chrome device for the first time, users will be greeted with a familiar desktop view similar to what you might find on a Windows or Mac PC. A “Launcher” button in the bottom-left corner replaces the Start button you’d find on a Windows machine, and a series of app icons are found in the menu bar beside it. Clicking those app icons doesn’t open individual apps, however. Instead, they open associated web pages. So, for example, clicking the Gmail icon will take you to gmail.com, and clicking the Docs icon will open the Google Docs website. You can still save files and work on them offline, and you can also download new “apps” from Google’s Chrome Web Store. Those apps all live within the Chrome browser, however — on a Chrome OS device, the browser is a portal into nearly every function. At least, it used to be. On newer Chromebooks like Samsung’s Chromebook Pro, users also have access to the Google Play store along with all the Android apps within. While some apps work better than others on Chrome OS, new users will be surprised at how well Android apps function on their Chrome devices. As just one example, Newton — my go-to email app on iOS and macOS devices — is far faster on the Chromebook Pro than on my MacBook Air. In fact, the Android version is better designed as well, and is ironically better suited to a desktop environment than the macOS version. In fact, it feels like everything is faster on the Chromebook Pro than it is on a conventional computer. Samsung’s Chromebook Pro is powered by a 2.2GHz Intel Core m3 processor along with Intel HD graphics and 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM. Those specs would seem underpowered on a Windows or Mac machine, but Chrome OS strips out the complexities that most consumers likely don’t need anyway. It feels like a mobile OS, and it flies like a mobile OS. Websites load just as fast as they would on any Windows or Apple PC, and apps open even faster since they’re so much more streamlined. Samsung’s less expensive Chromebook Plus is powered by a 2GHz hexa-core OP1 ARM chipset, which offers a bit less power and lesser graphics performance while shaving $100 from the device’s price tag. The two models are otherwise nearly identical. In its current state, the Chrome OS platform is more than capable enough to handle both work and play for the vast majority of users. Chrome is not yet ready for people who need to use custom enterprise software or complex software like professional video editing apps. But for everyone else, it’s a serious contender. As you might expect on a Samsung device, the 12.3-inch LED display on the Chromebook Pro is stunning. It features 2400×1600 Quad HD resolution and brightness is rated at 400nit. Streaming videos look fantastic on the bright screen, and the 3:2 aspect ratio offers plenty of room to position multiple apps around the screen and multitask. The Chromebook Pro also ships with a stylus that can be popped out from an edge just like a Note-series smartphone or tablet. It’s not quite as feature rich as the S Pen and it’s certainly not integrated as deeply into the operating system, but it’s great for taking notes. For drawing or painting, Samsung’s new notebook will ship with an app called Art Canvas, though it wasn’t available in the pre-release software running on my test unit. The stylus can also be used to capture portions of the screen, or as a virtual magnifying glass to help users read small print. Samsung put a great deal of effort into the writing experience on the Chromebook Pro, and it shows. The feel is fantastic — as close to “pen on paper” as Samsung’s Note smartphones — and a special algorithm developed by Google helps lower latency by predicting where each stroke will go as you write. There is still noticeable latency on the device when you write quickly, but I don’t find it to be bothersome at all. Also of note, the screen on the Chromebook Pro can fold all the way open so the device can be used comfortably in tablet mode. I only wish as much attention had been paid to the keyboard, which is one of my least favorite things about this laptop. The plastic keys on the device feel cheap and they require too much pressure to depress. I also wish the keyboard had wider delete and tab keys, though I do like the dedicated Search button in place of the Caps Lock. This key opens the Launcher window, which is a home base of sorts in Chrome OS, giving users access to a search bar and to apps. The trackpad is nice and big on the Chromebook Pro, and it’s also quite responsive. The device includes two USB Type-C ports, either of which can be used to charge the notebook, as well as a 3.5mm audio jack and a microSD card slot. The Chromebook Pro ships with just 32GB of onboard storage since Chrome OS is a cloud-first platform, but microSDXC support adds an inexpensive and easy option for expansion. The device itself weighs just 2.38 pounds and measures 11.04 x 8.72 x 0.55 inches. That makes it thinner and lighter than Apple’s new 13-inch MacBook Pro, which measures 0.59 inches thick and weighs a hair over 3 pounds. The light weight can be attributed in part to the plastic housing, but the Chromebook Pro also only has a 39-watt-hour battery compared to up to 54.5-watt-hours in the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The Chromebook still manages to offer an estimated 8-10 hours of battery life per charge though, thanks largely to its efficient Core m3 chipset and the lightweight Chrome OS. In the end, the Chromebook Pro is a device that redefines the Chromebook category. It’s the first Chromebook to include an integrated stylus and pen support, but the laptop’s power plays a bigger role in this area. Samsung’s Chromebook Pro and devices like it offer performance that hasn’t been seen before on a Chrome OS device, extending the addressable market to include power users who otherwise wouldn’t look twice at a Chromebook. As for pricing and availability, the Samsung Chromebook Pro will be released sometime in late April for $549. Of note, the Google Play store for Chrome will exit beta around the same time. Samsung’s more affordable ARM-powered Chromebook Plus can be preordered right now for $449 on Amazon or on Samsung’s website, and it will start shipping this Sunday, February 12th. Here’s a quick video that shows of the Chromebook Plus model that will be released this weekend: Tags: chrome os, Chromebook Pro, google, Samsung View Comments Trending 1 Entertainment Activision admits taking ‘Call of Duty’ to space was a bad idea 2 Tech Not even T-Mobile can touch the new deal Sprint just announced 3 Tech The Galaxy Note 7 disaster is forcing Samsung to make the Galaxy S8 worse 4 Tech We’ll probably see the iPhone 8 sooner than we thought 5 Deals 10 paid iPhone apps on sale for free today Picked For You The Galaxy Note 7 disaster is forcing Samsung to make the Galaxy S8 worse By Chris Smith February 9th at 9:02 PM Leaked photos show us how stunning Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design will be By Zach Epstein February 9th at 1:38 PM World’s top insider just confirmed one of Apple’s key iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s features By Chris Smith February 9th at 11:58 AM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad Post to Cancel

Google's Android Wear 2.0 wearable computing operating system will be the first version that fully supports on-device machine learning technology. The ML technology, developed by Google's Expander research team, will power smart messaging across Google applications as well as third-party messaging apps installed on the wearable. The feature will let users of Android Wear 2.0 wearables respond to incoming chat messages with a single tap and without having to be connected to a cloud service. Up to now, the ML systems behind the conversational understanding and image recognition capabilities supported by many Google apps, have been hosted in the cloud. The systems have typically combined technologies, such as graph-based machine learning and deep neural networks that are so computationally and memory intensive they could only be run in the cloud. With Android Wear 2.0, Google has introduced a newly designed lightweight ML architecture for enabling Smart Reply on Android Wear and similar capabilities on other mobile applications installed on a device, Google staff research scientist Sujith Ravi wrote on the company’s Research Blog this week. Smart Reply is a feature that Google introduced with Inbox that is capable of generating automatic responses to incoming messages using machine learning and natural language processing smarts. The technology looks at the words used in a message and the context in which they are used to automatically generate a list of potential responses that the user can choose to respond to the message. The goal is to make it easier for users to respond to incoming messages. In order to deploy Smart Reply capabilities entirely on to a smart device like Android Wear, Google had to first develop a lightweight ML architecture, Ravi said. The big challenge was in figuring out a way to compress the machine learning models that Google typically runs in the cloud and make it fit in a small device's memory while also ensuring the models produce robust predictions. Google made multiple attempts at taking its existing machine learning models and shrinking them down to a fraction of their size, but after the attempts failed to yield useful results, the company decided to try an entirely new approach, Ravi noted in his blog. The new lightweight on-device ML powering Android Wear 2.0 uses a fast mechanism to compute potential responses to incoming messages more quickly, on-the-fly and with a small memory requirement, he said. The new machine learning architecture eliminates the need for the device to be connected to a cloud service in order for Smart Reply to work. "Apps running on the device can pass a user's incoming messages and receive reply predictions from the on-device model without data leaving the device," he said. The technology can be adapted so it is capable of learning the user's individual preferences and writing styles and using that knowledge to create personalized responses. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said the company intends to use machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to make its applications and services smarter. The company's long-term goal is to use machine learning and AI to enable conversational understanding across most of its products so users can interact with them via voice commands.           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Google Android Wear 2.0 to Feature on-Device Machine Intelligence Cortana to Help Windows Users Keep Their Word on Promises in Email Google Addresses Concerns About URL Handling for AMP-Enabled Web Pages Cisco Report: Mobile Phones Will Number 5.5 billion by 2021 Evernote Makes Notetaking Frictionless in iOS App Revamp                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

Thanks, TC Team Startup BattlefieldWe're Accepting Applications for Startup Battlefield At Disrupt NY Apply Today Ex-Googler (and Cisco’s newest board member) Amy Chang on her leap into startups Posted 17 hours ago by Connie Loizos (@cookie) 0 SHARES Next Story Facebook says it will open up for independent ad audit Wednesday night, at a StrictlyVC event in San Francisco, venture capitalist Aileen Lee took the stage to interview Amy Chang, a former eBay product manager turned head of Google Analytics turned startup founder. It’s a transition that has introduced Chang to night sweats, she readily admitted. Chang’s three-year-old startup, Accompany,  received one of its first checks from Lee’s firm, Cowboy Ventures. And Lee asked Chang about what it’s like to leave behind a cushy paycheck to launch something new, even with her former Google colleague, Matthias Ruhl — a large-scale systems design expert — by her side as her cofounder. For one thing, Chang said, getting the company to the point where it could launch publicly took far longer than either she or Ruhl imagined it would. Though they now claim that they’ve built the second-largest database of people behind LinkedIn — Accompany basically creates cheat sheets for folks  who need to get up to speed quickly on the new people and companies they meet every day — it took them 2.5 years. They’ve also had to raise a bunch of money — $40 million altogether so far. “It was a much bigger data challenge than we expected,” Chang said. “We had to build this whole data platform ourselves. Though once you have textured understanding of how a person’s network lays out . . . you can serve them a lot better.” The native Texan, who nabbed her electrical engineering degree from Stanford and stayed in California, has also learned the pleasures and pain of working with 40 people, compared with the hundreds she managed at Google. “When you’re at Google and it’s more a GM role, you’re managing to a mean.” Explained Chang, “On any given day, maybe 20 percent of people are performing at a 5 [level] out of a 10. They’ve got stuff going on or are distracted by something. That 20 percent who aren’t operating at a 9 or 10 level of intensity is okay, because in the grand scheme of things, you’re [still in good shape].” When it’s 40 people, “every person matters. I know now whose child is sick — whose cat is sick. I have to make sure people’s emotional needs are met because if they aren’t, they can’t focus and perform” at the level required to move a startup meaningfully forward every day. The good news for Chang: her leap out of Google appears to be paying off. Though she declined to get into granular detail about her business, owing to competitive concerns (Accompany is far from the only virtual assistant game in town), she was recently pursued by Cisco, which invited her to join its board. She says that plum role came about because recruiter Jim Citrin, who leads Spencer Stuart’s North American CEO practice, began using Accompany last year, “got excited about it,” and told Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins to try it, too. “He was like, ‘Who makes this?'” It helps that Cisco was looking for a digital native who’d grown up with mobile and with analytics in particular to add to its board. “I kind of fit the profile, and there was good chemistry,” she said. The position — which pays her a $75,000 annual retainer and gives her a grant of restricted stock worth several hundred thousand dollars, says a recent New York Times article — presumably offsets much of the financial pressure that many other company founders face. But Chang says she still wakes up in a cold panic at 3 a.m. oftentimes. She has resigned herself to the fact that it’s the new normal. But she did have some advice to other aspiring founders in the room: “Do not wake up your spouse every time it happens.” 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report VIDEO | 2:38 | Crunch Report Carl Bass on his surprising Autodesk exit — and what’s next 13 hours ago | Connie Loizos Uncorking innovation with Treasury Wine Estates in Napa 14 hours ago | Lora Kolodny Beats X bring Apple’s wireless headphone tech to a tethered form factor 16 hours ago | Brian Heater Facebook says it will open up for independent ad audit 18 hours ago | Anthony Ha Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report: Prince returns to Spotify 9 hours ago | Anthony Ha Weekly Roundup: Tech companies rally against Trump’s immigration ban, Zenefits cuts workforce again 10 hours ago | Anna Escher Trump’s immigration ban is terrible for entrepreneurs 10 hours ago | Samia Bahsoun Payback’s a gift 11 hours ago | Talia Goldberg, Jeremy Levine Comment moderation powered by Up Next Facebook says it will open up for independent ad audit Posted 18 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings Data Migration Consultant at Exerp (West Palm Beach, FL, United States) Integration Consultant at Exerp (West Palm Beach, FL, United States) SENIOR ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE at Waxman Strategies (Washington, DC, United States) Senior Backend Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Senior Data Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

The brief, filed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, aims to overrule a federal jury’s decision in May that Google did nothing illegal. The appeal is the latest iteration of the dispute which formally started in 2010 and has since been to two federal trials and multiple appeals courts. ADVERTISEMENT Oracle contends in the seven-year legal battle that Google’s use of Oracle software, specifically its use of Java API in its Android OS, violates copyright law. “When a plagiarist takes the most recognizable portions of a novel and adapts them into a film, the plagiarist commits the ‘classic’ unfair use,” Oracle wrote in their appeal referencing ‘fair use’ provisions in copyright law. “Google’s copying in this case is the software equivalent of this classic unfair use.” The company argued that Google “reaped enormous commercial benefits from copying … Java APIs,” to explicitly “target and steal Oracle’s customers.” Google declined to comment on the appeal. In May, however, Google issued a statement in support of the jury’s decision. “Today's verdict that Android makes fair use of Java APIs represents a win for the Android ecosystem, for the Java programming community, and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products,” a Google spokesperson said. The jury that issued the decision in May said that Google’s actions were legal under “fair use” in copyright law — the doctrine that excerpts of copyrighted material can be legally used without permission in some situations. Oracle did not immediately respond to request for comment on the appeal. The almost decade-long legal dispute is only a part of the bad blood that exists between the two companies. In May, a Fortune report found that Oracle was a contributor to the "The Google Transparency Project," a non-profit with the expressed purpose of scrutinizing Google. In 2012, Oracle joined an anti-Google lobbying group.   View the discussion thread. Most Popular Most Popular Discussed Past: 1 day 1 FEC commissioner to Trump: Show...

 Google Home makes a play for mass appeal with Super Bowl ads BI Intelligence Feb. 7, 2017, 11:36 AM 1,241 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Tech giants take on each other in the smart home The Internet of Everything — $12.6 trillion ROI expected over the next decade [SLIDE DECK] $1.9 trillion dollars of economic value could be created by the use of IoT devices and asset tracking solutions This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Many consumers still view smart home devices as expensive, gimmicky, and difficult to use, and the market has remained stagnant as a result. But Google and other companies that produce voice-activated speakers appear to be making an effort to change this perception, as evidenced by the numerous Google Home ads featured during Super Bowl LI this past weekend. This is one of the first times a large number of consumers were exposed to the Home, which could potentially drive adoption of not only the speaker, but also the smart home more broadly. Once consumers see the smart home as more than just a luxury, they'll likely begin to purchase connected devices and build out their ecosystems, especially if they already have a voice-activated speaker like the Google Home or Amazon Echo. Here’s what Google is trying to do through its promotion of the Home: Google is primarily aiming to bring the smart home to mainstream consumers through these ads. With ownership of smart home devices remaining low and not growing quickly, these ads are an effort to expose smart home products to mainstream consumers. These consumers have not adopted the smart home en masse, and they still see such devices as a luxury rather than a utility. Large-scale ads, however, are the first step toward shifting consumer attitudes. Once consumers have these devices in their homes, they'll likely want to take full advantage of their utility and purchase other connected devices to build out a full ecosystem. But Google also wants to eat into Amazon’s increasingly dominant market share in the voice-activated speaker market. While the Google Home has gained more abilities after opening to third-party developers late last year, the Echo product line has retained a dominant market share. The low price point of the Dot led to the device being very popular during the holiday season, and the device’s install base drastically increased over the past few months, as Slice Intelligence noted in a recent report. Google hopes to make the Home just as popular as the Echo line, though as BI Intelligence has previously identified, this process will take some time and not be easy for the company. Overall, these ads point to the role that voice can play in triggering smart home adoption. Voice-activated speakers can be found in a growing number of homes not just because of the convenience and utility they offer, but also because they're now available at lower price points — the Echo Dot, for example, retails at about $50, and the Google Home retails at about $129.99, versus $179.99 for an original Echo. Further, as device prices come down and device replacement cycles are slowly overcome, consumers could be even more willing to integrate smart home solutions into their lives, something BI Intelligence argued as early as 2015. As the smart home continues to mature, consumers will increasingly look to pair inexpensive devices with their voice-activated speakers, a phenomenon that will fuel adoption into the mass-market phase. The U.S. smart home market has yet to truly take off. At its current state, we believe the smart home market is stuck in the 'chasm' of the technology adoption curve, in which it is struggling to surpass the early-adopter phase and move to the mass-market phase of adoption. There are many barriers preventing mass-market smart home adoption: high device prices, limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles. However, the largest barrier is the technological fragmentation of the smart home ecosystem, in which consumers need multiple networking devices, apps and more to build and run their smart home. John Greenough, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the U.S. smart home market that analyzes current consumer demand for the smart home and barriers to widespread adoption. It also analyzes and determines areas of growth and ways to overcome barriers. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Smart home devices are becoming more prevalent throughout the US. We define a smart home device as any stand-alone object found in the home that is connected to the internet, can be either monitored or controlled from a remote location, and has a noncomputing primary function. Multiple smart home devices within a single home form the basis of a smart home ecosystem. Currently, the US smart home market as a whole is in the "chasm" of the tech adoption curve. The chasm is the crucial stage between the early-adopter phase and the mass-market phase, in which manufacturers need to prove a need for their devices. High prices, coupled with limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles, are three of the four top barriers preventing the smart home market from moving from the early-adopter stage to the mass-market stage. For example, mass-market consumers will likely wait until their device is broken to replace it. Then they will compare a nonconnected and connected product to see if the benefits make up for the price differential. The largest barrier is technological fragmentation within the connected home ecosystem. Currently, there are many networks, standards, and devices being used to connect the smart home, creating interoperability problems and making it confusing for the consumer to set up and control multiple devices. Until interoperability is solved, consumers will have difficulty choosing smart home devices and systems. "Closed ecosystems" are the short-term solution to technological fragmentation. Closed ecosystems are composed of devices that are compatible with each other and which can be controlled through a single point. In full, the report: Analyzes the demand of US consumers, based off of survey results Forecasts out smart home device growth until 2020 Determines the current leaders in the market Explains how the connected home ecosystem works Examines how Apple and Google will play a major role in the development of the smart home Some of the companies mentioned in this report include Apple, Google, Nest, August, ADT, Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, Lowe's, and Honeywell.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: CrossOver Android Preview brings Windows apps to Chromebooks 0 by Surur  @mspoweruser Aug 26, 2016 at 18:46 GMT6 months ago Codeweavers has announced that the Tech Preview of CrossOver for Android is now available, allowing ChromeOS users with Intel processors to run Windows applications on their laptops. The app uses WINE API translation technology and supports apps as sophisticated as Office 2010, Quicken and DirectX9 and Steam, but does not support every Windows application. Minimum specs are Android 5, the Google Play store on Chrome, an Intel, not ARM processor and 2 GB of RAM. The APK is being distributed via the Google Play Store where testers can sign up to be beta testers. ChromeOS is a Google-created operating system popular in the US education environment, where much of the world is browser based, but virtually unknown elsewhere. Google has recently added support for Android apps on ChromeOS and brought the Google Play Store to a select number of ChromeOS laptops. This has brought millions of Android apps to the platform, but unfortunately most of these apps are designed for touch, and are not optimised for keyboard and mouse, unlike Windows Applications, making Crossover welcome news for dedicated ChromeOS fans. See the technology in action in a video below: Codeweaver also makes Crossover for the Mac and Linux with the same functionality, suggesting while this development is interesting it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the Windows market.

Just get Windows Doubt many would be interested in their effort. cr_buck Actually there are those who despise Windows but either need or want to use a particular program. WINE was created a long time ago on Linux for that purpose. I would prefer to just use Windows but to each his own. Victor V I don’t think anyone owns a Chrome book …. tsk tsk google TheCyberKnight Seriously. Install Windows 10 and you’re done. Will run everything. Likely smoother. End of discussion. This is getting ridiculous. MrTrunky I own one, it’s fast as lightning and very useful, it’s far ahead of Continuum. Victor V You are one of the few. I’ve yet to meet anyone who owns a Chromebook. **I’m not a recluse and my job has me working with many different people in a technical capacity. Tom For many people, a Windows PC is an overkill. Anymore, a lot of users do little more than browse the web. Using a PC for that is like using a sledge hammer to drive a thumbtack. My wife is a perfect example of who WINE on a Chromebook is for. She uses a Chromebook almost exclusively. She uses a PC maybe once or twice a week because of two programs not available on a Chromebook. She does not like the PC, but uses it because she has to. With WINE on the Chromebook, she no longer has to. xma1e shame MS couldn’t get their act together and have Android running on WP. theminimalist omg! Google invented new technology! 😀 MrTrunky Well, according to IDC Chromebook sales outsold MacBook sales. Yes, I’m not one of the few .. one of the few millions ?? C F Actually its not google Michael Boumann You mean your Chromebook can become a phone? Nice. anchovylover Don’t burst his bubble, he thinks he is witty. anchovylover You can actually customize W10 a lot on desk top. You can neuter Cortana and One Drive if a user wishes. They can remove all tiles or even install a third party start menu and completely ignore the store. Turn telemetry down to basic and obviously install another browser. There is so much people can do if they wish. anchovylover I’m not sure that was in MS hands. anchovylover I find Chromebooks interesting but how can you compare it to the abilities of Continuum? Real Warder So… How are these hundreds of school PCs better than continuum? They fit in your pocket? Real Warder Biggest issue with Wine is it runs old programs only. Try getting the latest photo shop and you soon realize why Windows is more capable and compatible. Anantha Krishna I am pretty sure project Astoria was in MS’s hands. Celso Tito Dos Santos Godoy Microsoft started in desktop and Google in mobile, Microsoft tries to raise in mobile and Google tries to raise in desktop. SUCH TECH WAR Nicholas Maguire How can a PC be overkill for anything? You open up a browser and browse. Isn’t that just as simple as it is on a ChromeBook? A PC is simple for anything. You can do one thing just as simply as you can on anything else. And I’ve used WINE on Linux and Mac, it’s horrible. Using WINE it’s better to expect software to NOT work good going in, as not to get your hopes up. anchovylover Actually, good point. I had forgotten about that. I remember on Windows Weekly they claimed that they knew the reason it was axed was because it was too easy and therefore why would developers even bother with UWP apps. Thanks for the reminder, I must be getting old 🙂 Victor yeah, i own one too. i use it in the kitchen mostly. i used to have an windows laptop but it was always updates and stuff going on before i could use it. with this i can just lift the lid and its on. should not compare it to a PC tho. but its google so haters gonna hate… Victor well, if you have a chromecast, you can cast to a tv. Hashirama Senju “Yes, I’m not one of the few .. one of the few millions ??” LOL Thats what the Linux and WP fanboys say. XD MrTrunky Chrome OS supports multitask, windows resizing, and much more, Continuum doesn’t. Reed the news, you can install Android apps on a Chromebook, and now also is posible to install Windows x86 apps. The smartphone, the dock and a monitor fit in you pocket? Wow!! You are Doraemon? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0d729b4d2ecbc6531fdea058c210fc49051a5d7e13aeef68d3841e1a1a3f368b.jpg MrTrunky No, I mean my Chromebook supports multitask, windows resizing, can run almost all Android software, and more features that Continuum doesn’t support. Real Warder I think you are completely missing what Continuum is about. My Windows laptop blows away every Chromebook. It was a good idea and for some reason they are now trying to mutate it a into a PC. Big fail so far. Still can’t even print to my USB canon printer. Or run Photoshop. Ramsay So you’re comparing a phone to a chromebook? Then why not compare my Windows laptop to an android phone? Mine can multitask, supports windows resizing, can run any android software using an emulator. Yep So run linux photo editing software on Chromebook or android Yep Because Windows is running tons of processes in the background whereas Chromebook isn’t. MrTrunky I can print from my Chromebook the same way I can print from my smartphone, with an Ethernet/WiFi enabled printer. I think your printer is toooo old if doesn’t support it. If you read this article, you will notice that Photoshop can be installed on a Chromebook. Anyway, Photoshop is not a need for average users. Real Warder Why would you be content to be so limited to only use some printers and some apps when with a Windows PC you can use any printer and any application? You can run everything 100% perfectly on Windows. MrTrunky I can use my printer, and thats enough. I don’t need to use other people printers. Also I have a PC with Windows and Ubuntu that I use for work (I’m web developer), but most of the time I use the Chromebook cause it turns on almost instantly and it’s perfect for browse the web, edit docs, and much more. spazinvader A Chromebook is a PC. You mean a desktop? Or a windows laptop? spazinvader You can control what is running and what should not run. Using 2 laptops for single work is insane. spazinvader For your use case, an Android tablet would suffice. Why you even went for a Chromebook is beyond me. spazinvader This is Chromebook. You can run Android on Windows laptops. And you cannot run Windows Phone in Android(like you mentioned Android running on WP) Real Warder So your real work is done on a PC. My laptop turns on instantly too when I open the lid. Still not seeing any reason to compromise with a Chromebook. MrTrunky A Chromebook is a better option than an Android tablet for a lot of reason; – I personaly prefer a laptop form factor – Has more battery life than most tablets (9 hours of use) – Has full Chrome browser (With extensiones and apps) vs simple mobile Chrome on tablets – Bigger screen – Full physical keyboard, with backlight – Can run the same software (Includes Play Store) and more (With Wine con run Windows software, explained in this article) – Multitask with resizable windows – It’s cheaper than most decent Android tablets (180$, for this price you only find low quality tablets) – Can run full Linux distros if desired For this reasons, and more, a Chromebook it’s a very good choice, the best for my usecase. If you are curious, my Chromebook is a CB3-131 MrTrunky Its simple, right now and don’t work at home, but in the office. At home only I browse the web, and little more, and I like to do It from the sofa. For this use a Chromebook is better, cause is faster than Windows, has better battery life (Up to 9 hours of real usage) it’s simpler, the updates are totally transparent, without any wait or reboot, I dont need and antivirus, etc, etc.. In summary, I can do It all that I need, for more time, without any wait or interruption, and for less money. Acer CB3-131, just buy one for 180$ and you will see it’s adventages.

Google’s affordable “just a browser” devices are the best-selling computers in schools, and they’re percolating around boardrooms and cubicles. Last fall, more people bought Chromebooks than Macs—and that’s not going to switch back anytime soon. Now Google’s out to convince you, regular human, person of sound mind and reasonable budget, that you ought to buy a Chromebook. Popular Searches Michael Kors Holdings Ltd KORS ▲ 38.38 +0.11 +0.29% AstraZeneca PLC AZN ▲ 29.53 +0.23 +0.79% Homeland Security Corp HSCC ▼ 0.0090 -0.0014 -13.29% Newpark Resources Inc NR = 8.15 0.00 0.00% The consumer Chromebook onslaught starts with Samsung’s Chromebook Plus and Pro, which are on paper the most well-rounded Chrome OS devices ever. The Plus starts at $450 and is available next week, and the Pro will be $550 when it ships in March. Both fit right into the normal-person laptop budget. They do all the Chrome OS things, have great and flippy touchscreens, and even support pen input. And best of all, they run all of the millions of apps in Google’s Play Store. They’re part smartphone, part tablet, part laptop, combined in a way that feels like the computer of the future.) RELATED: How Chromebooks Are About to Totally Transform Laptop Design I’ve been using the Pro for the last couple of weeks. Like I said, it sounds great… on paper. In reality, this brilliantly polymorphic computer still feels more like a science experiment. The Good Kind of Cheap It shouldn’t be that hard to make a good laptop. Most people want the same things: A relatively light and thin body, attractive enough you don’t mind being seen with it in public. Well-spaced, clicky keyboard, and spacious, smooth trackpad. High-res screen, and enough power and battery to get you through even an extra-long day at work. Pretty straightforward, right? According to your average $500 Best Buy Special, this is very hard. The Chromebook Pro proves it’s at least possible. At about a half-inch thick and 2.38 pounds, it’s smaller than almost every laptop not named MacBook. It doesn’t ooze class and wealth every time you open the lid, but the magnesium alloy body (mine’s silver, but yours will be black) at least won’t look out of place in Economy Comfort. Even more so once you peel off the unsightly Energy Star sticker. The rounded edges and exposed hinge give it a decidedly utilitarian look—you’re not holding a future Smithsonian exhibit in your hands, you’re holding a laptop. And that’s just fine. The 12.3-inch, 2400×1600 display is excellent, and works well as a touchscreen too. But it really shines when you pop the tiny stylus out of the body of the Chromebook Pro. The stylus matches the one in Samsung’s Galaxy Note phones, and works just as well: you can draw, doodle, take notes, the whole nine. Google’s Keep note-taking app supports the pen as an input tool, and works fabulously. Trust me: there’s nothing quite so futuristic as signing a contract right on your computer screen. RELATED: Want a Peek at the Future of Laptops? Check Out Samsung’s New Chromebooks The whole kit runs on Intel’s Core M3 processor and four gigs of RAM. (The Chromebook Plus, which comes out next week and costs $450, runs on a lower-powered OP1 chip.) It has 32 gigs of internal storage, plus a microSD slot for adding more. None of those specs really matter, because power’s not an issue here and rarely ever is one on Chromebooks as a whole. The Chrome browser is so stable on these machines that it can handle more tabs and apps than my MacBook Pro. Not to mention, I get upwards of ten hours on the battery before I have to charge it. I used it basically non-stop during an hour-long train ride and six hours of flights, and still had plenty of battery left to watch The Good Place before bed. When you open the Pro’s lid, you’ll notice it never really stops opening. You can flip the screen a full 360 degrees, turning your laptop into a tablet. An awkward tablet, since the keyboard’s sitting right there on the back underneath your fingers, but a tablet nonetheless. It also sits sturdily like a teepee or like a digital picture frame, keyboard-down, both of which I used a lot—I sometimes watch Netflix while I cook, and it’s nice being able to hide the keyboard and trackpad from splattering olive oil. The downside of the 360-degree screen is that in order to accommodate all the ways you can hold it, Samsung had to make some weird layout choices. The power button’s on the right side, for instance, where I guarantee you’ll hit it by accident at least once a day. The headphone jack’s in the right place in laptopping (left side, at the rear) and thus bizarrely positioned for every other mode.© Samsung Samsung Those are all necessary compromises for this form factor. I like it, so I’ll take the compromises. I only have two true hardware problems: the speakers are terrible, and the keyboard isn’t backlit. Which is just stupid. But even with those issues, you won’t find better laptop hardware for this price. It’s thin, it’s fast enough, it’s long-lasting, it looks like a laptop made this decade. For $550, that’s a minor miracle. Harder Than It Looks The hardware works, but the Chromebook Pro’s software doesn’t. Google says everything will be fine before the device formally launches in April, and I have no reason to believe that’s not true. But from what I’ve seen so far, this hyper-versatile software trails way behind the hardware. Evidently combining Android and Chrome OS wasn’t as easy as it sounds. Some apps don’t recognize the keyboard and trackpad; others seem unable to handle a touchscreen. Some apps steadfastly refuse to connect to the internet. Most crash constantly, when they even open at all. Games beyond Solitaire-level complexity won’t run at all, not even on this more powerful model. Three times so far, the Chromebook Pro has crashed so spectacularly that I got a dozen error messages and the whole machine shut down. The whole point of a Chromebook is that things like that never happen.© Samsung Samsung Then there are the bugs. Oh, the bugs! Like the one where you flip the screen over to put the Pro in tent mode, and all your browser tabs disappear for no reason. Or how when you’re in tablet mode and try to put it to sleep, you just can’t. My favorite is the one where you open an app, and it just sits there flickering on the screen, forever trapped closing and opening. Again, Google seems well aware of these problems, and most appear to be fixable bugs. I’ll revisit this review closer to the launch, and I hope the story gets better. Right now, if I use a Chromebook Pro like other Chromebooks—tabs not apps, and laptop not tablet—it works great. It’s a light, thin, long-lasting, slightly expensive Chromebook. That’s just a much smaller vision than what this thing could be. It should let me play Netflix on one side and keep my dinner recipe up on the other. It should let me check Instagram and Snapchat right next to my work email. I should be playing Candy Crush and Asphalt 8 while I’m pretending to work. Instead it’s still just a web browser. That’s frustrating, because the Chromebook Pro was supposed to be the shape-shifting future of computing, Google’s answer to everything from the iPad Pro to the Surface Studio. It was supposed to be the first Chromebook that made no compromises, that was both secure and powerful, fast and feature-rich. Android apps and Chrome OS were a match made in heaven, a perfect way for smartphone owners to get into the laptop world. The hardware’s there: Samsung proved you can make the right kind of laptop at an attractive price, and I hope every other PC manufacturer is taking notes. But on the software side, it’s clearly unfinished. Luckily, you get to wait and see if Google fixes the Pro’s many problems. I’ll be back here to let you know how that goes. But for right now, know this: the dream of the just-right Chromebook is alive inside this machine, but it’s still just out of reach.

Sections Deseret NewsFamily Family 7 ways Google Photos can help organize, share pictures By Justin AdamsDeseret News Published: Feb. 10, 2017 5:05 p.m. Updated: 6 hours ago + Leave a comment From recognizing faces and sorting photos by location to creating slideshows and videos, Google Photos can help to both safely store the photos that tell a person's life story and to organize the photos that tell the story of ancestors' lives, said Devin Ashby of FamilySearch during a RootsTech conference class on Thursday afternoon. Google Photos is an app for both mobile and desktop devices and it's a tool available with a Gmail account. Here are several of the ways Ashby shared to use Google Photos to preserve your family history. 1. Cost. Users can store unlimited amounts of 16 megapixel photos and 1080p resolution video at no cost, he said. For those who want to keep larger file sizes, storage is limited. That shouldn't be a problem for most users, considering most smartphones don't take higher quality photos or videos anyway, Ashby said. 2. Clearing up space. As long as there is a Wi-Fi connection, people can sync the photo library on their phone to Google Photos. Once those have been uploaded, they can be deleted from the device. 3. Automatic sorting by location. The app automatically sorts your photos based on location or who is in the photo, Ashby said. For example, if a person goes skiing every weekend at the same resort and she takes lots of pictures there, Google Photos will put all those photos in one folder so they can be found easily. 4. Tagging people. Similarly, the app uses powerful facial recognition software to filter photos by who appears them, Ashby said. So when it's a loved one's birthday and a person wants to post a picture of them on Instagram, Google Photos will put all the photos available of that person in one place, allowing the perfect picture to be found without scrolling through the entire photo library, he said. 5. Sharing photos. Once photos are uploaded, they are very easy to share, Ashby said. To share, add in the email address of the person you want to share it with, and then they will have instant access to them. This makes collaborative albums on family vacations a breeze, Ashby said. Comment on this story 6. Sideshows and videos. Not only does Google Photos allow users to upload, organize and share their videos, it also lets them create easy slideshows and videos, Ashby said. Go through and select what photos and videos to include and then the app will put them all into a slideshow or video, he said. There is free licensed music available to add to videos to give them that extra dramatic flair, he said. 7. Digitizing and scanning prints. A big part of family history is digitizing old family photos, Ashby said. The problem is that this often requires expensive and slow scanners, or taking a photo with a digital camera which often leaves a glare, he said. PhotoScan, another Google app developed to go alongside Google Photos, allows users to digitize a photo in seconds while avoiding the glare you get with regular cameras, he said.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 11 February 2017 | MYT 10:00 AM Android Wear 2.0 launched with two new watches by LG Next gen: Android Wear 2.0 will feature on the new LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style. — Google Google has at last announced that Android Wear 2.0 will now be available, initially in the United States, on the all new LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style.  Originally planned for the autumn of 2016, this operating system update is loaded with new functionalities that will be of benefit to users of the latest generation of compatible smart watches.  Chief among the new features is the capacity to download applications from the new version of Google Play Store directly to the smart watch.  Among the apps that have already been announced are Foursquare, Runkeeper, Runtastic, Uber, Google Fit, Google Maps, Google Messenger, Google Play Music, and Android Pay (for compatible countries). The other major innovation is the integration of Google Assistant, which is only available in English and German for the moment.  In the new interface, Android Wear offers a wider choice of watch faces that can be customized with information chosen by users (time, temperature, number of steps...), an updated notification system, more responsive applications, more settings, etc.  The new version of Android Wear has also ushered in long awaited interactive features such as an on-screen keyboard and writing recognition that will allow users, for example, to use a finger to write a quick text message.  The launch of the new software is to be accompanied by two new Android Wear 2.0 watches, the LG Watch Style (1.2in circular screen) and the LG Watch Sport (1.38in screen), developed in close collaboration with Google. Both of these are now available in the United States and retail at US$249 (RM1,107) and US$349 (RM1,551) respectively.  As always in these cases rollout will follow a pattern established by Android for smartphones, that is to say that Android Wear 2.0 will be progressively deployed by different brands and on specific models from LG (Watch Urbane, G Watch R, Asus (ZenWatch 2 and 3), Huawei (Watch), Lenovo (Moto 360 Gen 2 and Sport), Tag Heuer (Connected) and Fossil (Q Founder, Marshal and Wander).  It should be noted that Samsung is now prioritising its alternative Tizen system. — AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Android Wear 2.0 launched with two new watches by LG E3 expands to include general public entry Tesla pausing factory for Model 3 preparation this month ‘Pokémon Go’ celebrates Valentine’s Day Google eyes office drones for virtual ‘telepresence’ meetings Experiencing painful menses?

While quite unstable, some users who have sideloaded the app are reporting (via Android Police) that Google Assistant is now enabled on their non-Pixel device. With version 6.13, some have reported that Google Assistant is now live on their non-Pixel device. Notably, this availability ranges from the Nexus 6P to the Alcatel Idol 4 and many other phones. On first run, users are greeted with a message informing them of the upgrade: New! You just got the Google Assistant From that point, pressing and holding down the home button reveals the same “Hi, how can I help?” prompt. Complete settings for Assistant are now available in the Google app, as are tutorials listing what Assistant can do. It’s more than likely that this is rolling out in error, as devices are mistakenly being identified as a Pixel in settings. This version also surfaces a ‘Recent’ feature that allows users to rediscover previously searched for topics. The card-like timeline interface fully loads, but the feature does not appear to work. Additionally, Google appears to be A/B testing a new, more compact weather card. Before installing, please note that not everybody who sideloaded has the Google Assistant enabled for them. The app is quite buggy, with frequent crashes and the Feed cards not properly loading until a force stop.

A federal court in Philadelphia has ruled that Google must comply with an FBI demand for certain customer data currently stored on Google servers located overseas. The data belongs to suspects in two separate domestic criminal investigations. The account holders are U.S residents and the crimes in question happened solely within the U.S. Google has so far refused to hand over the requested documents citing a recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a similar dispute involving Microsoft. Like Google, Microsoft had refused to comply with a court order asking it to provide the government with data that happened to be stored in one of the company's servers in Ireland. In that case, the appellate court had ruled in favor of Microsoft and said the company should not be forced to produce data stored overseas, because doing so would amount to an extra-territorial application of U.S. laws. The 11th annual Cisco Visual Networking Index Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast (2016 to 2021) projects that there will be more people on Earth using mobile phones in 2021 than there are with access to running water. The report stated that by 2021, more members of the global population will be using mobile phones than have bank accounts, running water, or landlines. Mobile data traffic shows no signs of slowing down. Furthermore 4G will support 58 percent of total mobile connections by 2021 and will account for 79 percent of total mobile data traffic. Machine-to-machine connections will represent 29 percent of total mobile connections. Mobile video will have the highest growth rate of any mobile application category and will represent 78 percent of all mobile traffic by 2021. Microsoft has kicked off a preview of its Storage Service Encryption for Azure customers, enabling organizations to protect their cloud files with the added security of an encryption at rest feature. "Microsoft handles all the encryption, decryption and key management in a fully transparent fashion," said Lavanya Kasarabada, a Microsoft Azure Storage program manager, in her Feb. 6 announcement. "All data is encrypted using 256-bit AES encryption, also known as AES-256, one of the strongest block ciphers available." During the preview period, Storage Service Encryption can only be enabled on newly-created storage accounts using Azure Resource Manager, Kasarabada explained. Google released its second Android patch update of 2017 on Feb. 6, providing users of the mobile operating system with patches for 58 different vulnerabilities, up significantly from the 13 flaws Google fixed in its February 2016 Android update. In the new February 2017 update, 8 vulnerabilities are rated by Google as critical. Among the critical vulnerabilities is CVE-2017-0405, which is a remote code execution vulnerability in an Android graphics library.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

Name: Subject: Message: Have fun and join the Google Home block party events in LA and NYC Newsby John Callaham8 hours ago 165 10 Google is taking more steps to help promote its Google Home connected speaker. After spending millions of dollars to run an older commercial during Super Bowl LI on Sunday, the company is hosting “block party” events in Los Angeles and New York City to give residents demos of the speaker, and also how it works with its Google Play Music streaming service. See also: What voice commands can I use with Google Home? November 10, 2016 Google says both events are designed to show people how “Google Play Music and Google Home work together seamlessly to provide an amazing in-home music experience”. The LA event is actually taking place close to the beach in Venice, California. If you are in the area, you can go to the Google Home block party at 1515 Abbot Kinney Blvd on Saturday, Feb. 11 and Sunday, Feb. 12. The event will be held both days from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. If you are in the cold and snow-bound New York City, you can still go to its own Google Home block party. It will be held in the Chelsea Market neighborhood at 75 9th Ave on Friday, Feb. 24 and Saturday, Feb. 25 from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. and again on Sunday, Feb. 26 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. You can check out a preview of what this block party will look like in the image above. Google has created three tiny houses to showcase how Google Home and Google Play Music can be incorporated in your home. In addition, it has invited stars of popular YouTube channels such as Wong Fu Productions, MyCupcakeAddiction, and Us the Duo to attend as well. They are supposed to show how they use the speaker and the music service in their own lives. Google appears to be going all out to promote Google Home, and we will have to see if its efforts can make a sales dent in its rivals, particular with Amazon’s Echo device lineup.

Nathan Ingraham, @nateingraham 20h ago in Personal Computing Comments 466 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Samsung's forthcoming Chromebook Pro, which the company introduced in partnership with Google at CES last month, appeared to be the latest contender in my search for the perfect premium Chromebook. For me, that means a high-resolution screen, excellent keyboard and trackpad, and a battery that lasts all day. I'm also looking for a well-designed machine, not the cheap, netbook-inspired computers that were the hallmark of earlier Chromebooks. On the surface, the Chromebook Pro offers all of that, along with a few new hardware and software tricks. It's the first Chromebook specifically designed with the Google Play Store and Android apps in mind. It's also the first Chrome OS device with a stylus, and Google added new features to its Keep note-taking app to make it work with a pen. Samsung and Google claim that the machine learning prediction should remove latency to the point that it feels like writing on the Surface Pro 4 -- one of the best stylus experiences available. Gallery: Samsung Chromebook Pro pre-production model | 9 Photos 9 +5 Of course, more than a quick CES demo is needed to see how the Chromebook Pro stacks up -- so I've been putting the device through the wringer over the last week and a half. However, this is not a formal review. Samsung provided reviewers with pre-production units; the final, finished product (which will ship in black, not the silver you see in these photos) won't ship until the end of April. With a few months to go, I wanted to give Samsung and Google some advice on what they can improve between now and launch time. When the Chromebook Pro eventually hits the market, we'll revisit it in the form of a scored review. The biggest issue with the Chromebook Pro also happens to be its most unique feature. The combination of stylus (which is basically identical to what you'd find in Samsung's Galaxy Note phones) and pressure-sensitive display is currently way too laggy to be useful. During a joint demonstration for reporters late last month, Samsung and Google specifically said how lag kills the experience of writing on a screen -- but right now, I'm always waiting for the screen to catch up with my pen strokes. Yes, I can technically take notes on this screen, but it's not the experience Google promised. And it's definitely not as good as the input experience on an iPad Pro or Surface Pro 4. At this point, I've pretty much given up on using the Chromebook's pen. It's important to note that Google says it hasn't yet turned on the machine learning writing assist in the version of Chrome OS that I'm running. That's part of the problem with using a pre-production machine: Some things just aren't ready yet, making the device difficult to evaluate. As it stands, this potentially unique feature adds nothing to the experience. Another problem is how Chrome OS plays with Android apps. This feature has been in the works for months, but it still doesn't feel ready for prime time; there are issues with both performance and implementation. Performance simply needs to be better for it to be worth running these apps alongside standard Chrome apps. Tools that I use daily (e.g., Google Play Music, Wunderlist, Pocket, Netflix, Google Calendar, Inbox and Google Docs) worked just fine -- but in most cases, the web versions were faster and better optimized for laptops than their Android counterparts. What's more, the games I tried (including Alto's Adventure, Dots & Co, Rayman's Adventure and the Google-recommended Asphalt 8) all felt laggy compared to how they run on Android phones and tablets. Consistently dropping frames when playing games is a big problem that defeats the purpose of playing them in the first place. The good news is that performance seems to have improved in the few weeks I've been using the Chromebook Pro, thanks to a series of software updates. Google will be gathering data on the Play Store and Android app usage in the next few months -- the Samsung Chromebook Plus (a laptop that's identical to the Pro with the exception of a weaker ARM processor) hits stores this Sunday, with the beta Play Store included. Hopefully the company will continue to optimize Android performance over the next few months before the Pro launches. There's also the simple matter of what the experience of using Android apps on a Chromebook will be like for first-time buyers. By default, a Chromebook's app drawer is loaded up with what are essentially web-app links for Google services likes Docs, Drive, Gmail, Keep and Photos, among others. But you can also download those same apps from the Play Store. If you want offline access to Google Play Music or Movies, for example, you'll need the Android apps. But the rest of the time, the web versions seem to work better. They were designed for traditional desktop computers, after all. Users can also end up with multiple versions of the same app and not really know which is which, or which is better to use. For example, I've used the Wunderlist Chrome app for a long time, but I also installed the Android version to see which is better. The website feels more fluid to me, but the Android app pops up notifications for my reminders. That's quite helpful for a reminders app, but using the Chrome version is generally a better experience. Which should I use? Running Android apps on Chrome OS is a lot like using an Android tablet: The whole experience just isn't optimized for a bigger screen. The Hangouts Android app, even when full-screen, is just one giant pane showing either your list of ongoing conversations or the details of whatever chat you're in. The Chrome app, on the other hand, has two panes, making it much easier to jump between threads. Similarly, I thought having Facebook Messenger running in a small vertical window on the side of my screen might be handy. But you can't resize the app, it only runs in portrait mode, and tapping enter doesn't actually send a message. You instead need to click on the "send" button, which slows things down. All told, my experience running Android apps was mixed at best. Generally, most web services are good enough at this point that the experience is superior to running Android on a laptop. The obvious exception is offline mode, but I'm offline infrequently enough that this didn't change my opinion. I still think there's potential here, but a good amount of refinement is needed, along with a tutorial to help new buyers understand when to use Android apps versus web apps. Another thing I hope to see Samsung and Google improve is the Chromebook Pro's battery life. The computer is rated for eight hours of usage, but I typically got little more than six. And the computer takes a long time to charge -- more than two and a half hours to go from three percent to full. That said, 90 minutes got me to about 88 percent, which was more than enough for another half-day of work. Although the battery itself is likely to be the same at launch, perhaps further software optimizations will get the computer to that eight-hour mark. To end on a positive note, I think it's worth discussing some of the things that the Chromebook Pro does right. For starters, the form factor hits all the right note for me. While Samsung's design language hasn't changed much over the years, it nonetheless makes for a pleasing look. The rounded corners make it comfortable both for typing and carrying -- and they also give it a distinctive aesthetic that helps keep the laptop from looking like yet another MacBook Air clone. That quality isn't skin-deep either. The Chromebook Pro feels much more sturdy than HP's similarly priced Chromebook 13. The all-important keyboard and trackpad are similarly reliable. They both feel slightly cramped compared to my MacBook Air, but the keys themselves are responsive and there's nothing wrong with the trackpad aside from being a little small. The 2,400 x 1,600 display is also a highlight. It's bright and sharp, and features the same 3:2 aspect ratio as the now-discontinued Chromebook Pixel. That might mean wider black bars when you're watching a movie, but the majority of the time I really appreciated the extra vertical screen real estate. The laptop's default 1,200 x 800 scaled resolution means most UI elements are pretty large, but scaling things up to 1,350 x 900 gave me more room for my content. The hinge in particular feels both strong and smooth, with no sticking or hitches as it moves from laptop to tablet mode. And while software problems made writing on the screen less than ideal, the hardware side of the equation is actually pretty good. There's a slight bit of resistance when using the stylus that makes it feel more like a writing instrument on paper and less like a stylus sliding across slick glass. Given this computer's pre-production status, I'm not ready to say whether or not it's worth the $550 asking price. That will depend on how much Google improves the software experience over the next few months. Simply turning on the machine learning feature should make using the stylus much smoother, and Google will continue optimizing Android app performance in the coming weeks. But it remains to be seen if this is the Chromebook that will convince people to pay a more premium price. I'm cautiously optimistic because I've been looking for a higher-quality Chromebook for a while. But if you just want an inexpensive laptop for getting things done, there are plenty of cheaper options available now. For the time being, those of you who want a premium Chromebook should wait until April to decide if Samsung deserves your cash.

According to a lengthy court document filed today by the database giant, and obtained by El Reg, Oracle will once again make its case that Google violated copyrights it holds on Java. The House of Hurd n' Catz claims it should get yet another trial because it wasn't able to present evidence in the first handful of cases that it thinks would turn the tables. "Although Oracle is entitled to judgment on the evidence the jury heard, Oracle's actual case against fair use was far stronger," the filing reads. "At every turn, in countless ways, the district court issued rulings that obstructed Oracle's case." The filing is the latest in the years-long battle between Google and Oracle over allegations that Google violated Oracle copyright on Java code with components of its Android operating system. Google had prevailed twice in the case, most recently winning an appeal in the US Northern District. This time, Oracle argues that Google's wins should not stand up in a court of appeals. "In the first trial in this case, the jury found that Google's Android software infringes Oracle's copyrights in the Java Standard Edition ('SE') platform but hung on the question of whether Google's copying was a fair use," Oracle says. "After the trial, the district court held that the portions of Java that Google copied were not entitled to copyright protection and entered judgment for Google." The case, Oracle America vs Google Inc, is being heard by the US Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in the Northern District of California. ® Tips and corrections 13 Comments More from The Register Trump's immigration clampdown has Silicon Valley techies fearing for their house prices Don't worry too much, suggest real-estate bods 90 Comments Why software engineers should ditch Silicon Valley for Austin And it has nothing to do with South by Southwest 49 Comments Supermicro boasts of secret super server Silicon Valley win 30,000+ into a single 'valley data centre - but whose is it? 8 Comments Tech Trump: Silicon Valley steps into the valley of unhappiness It's a long litany of problematic positions 62 Comments Who's in Peter's file?

Home Opinion Fight against piracy: Google’s new cod may have limited impact Fight against piracy: Google’s new cod may have limited impact The fight against piracy has been on for a long time. Governments have been banning sites that host pirated software, films, songs, etc, and also the services that allow users to download these. By: The Financial Express | New Delhi | Published: February 11, 2017 4:38 AM Google, too, had gone on the offensive terming some as repeat-offenders, but the market for piracy has been going strong. (Reuters) The fight against piracy has been on for a long time. Governments have been banning sites that host pirated software, films, songs, etc, and also the services that allow users to download these. Google, too, had gone on the offensive terming some as repeat-offenders, but the market for piracy has been going strong. Now, according to a report by The Independent, Google and other search engines, in association with entertainment firms, are drafting a new code to reduce the reflection of links to pirated content—like Torrent links—on their platform. Say, if a person were to search for a movie download link, then he will be directed to less of such websites. Also, with the government banning many of these, the available services could be considerably lower. Also Watch: Not that Google has not been fighting against piracy, but the new rigour comes at a time when the company is itself offering music and video services via its platform. But winning a fight against pirated content may not be so easy. Even if this code is introduced, companies would start masking their content, needing a deeper response. The ban imposed is just on peer-to-peer file-sharing services like Torrents, where a person uploads such content on a server which can then be downloaded by millions using file-sharing platforms and does not apply to streaming services, which people have been using more, given the advances in net-speed. More important, given how just a month ago, people had discovered that there was a loophole in Youtube, one of the Google run products, which allowed people to upload adult content on it, there is a possibility Google knows very less of what happens on its own platforms. Ultimately, the push against piracy would have to come from entertainment companies giving people faster and high-quality services at lower rates. This is evident from the growth of video services like Netflix and Amazon Prime and audio services like Spotify and Apple Music, across the world. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Ford will be the majority stakeholder in Argo AI. Although Argo AI will become technically Ford’s subsidiary, the automaker said Argo AI has been structured to operate with substantial independence. Ford President and CEO Mark Fields said during the press briefing, “There is a war for talent going on out there.”  He explained that Argo employees will have significant equity in the company, which he believes will make it easier to hire top talent. “Our short term goal for Argo AI is to bring SAE’s Level 4 autonomous cars to the market by 2021,” said Fields. Down the road, Ford is considering licensing the technology to others, he added.    Argo AI, founded in November, 2016, lists Salesky as its CEO and Rander as COO. The company declined to disclose how many people are already working at the startup. Mike Demler, senior analyst at the Linley Group, said, "At this point, Argo is nothing but a few smart guys from Google and Uber." But with their plan to hire 200 people by the end of the year, they will integrate the Ford autonomous-vehicle team into a wholly-owned subsidiary, he explained. When Raj Nair, Ford’s executive vice president for Global Product Development, and chief technical officer, was asked about the specific Argo AI technologies that attracted Ford, he said, “When the industry’s two top talents – two pioneers in the field – are suddenly becoming available, you don’t pass up an opportunity like that.” The companies declined to draw any detailed comparisons between Argo AI and other automotive AI tech companies such as Google. Unique hybrid model Instead, they stressed that the partnership represents a “unique hybrid business model,” under which Ford can take advantage of the speed and agility of the startup, while Argo AI can leverage Ford’s strategy and resources.   More specifically, as Salesky explained, “Argo AI makes a brain of the virtual driver system, while Ford develops nerve systems, skeleton and muscle” within autonomous cars. The tech startup sees the partnership with Ford as invaluable. Salesky stressed that the autonomous car “is a system’s problem. Software and hardware need to be integrated. We need a full vehicle development team behind it.” Ford CTO Nair added that with the hybrid model, “We bring solid funding, and customers, while we also offer the ability to integrate Argo’s AI system.” The autonomous vehicle platform will be owned by Ford. The Linley Group's Demler said, according to the Ford CEO, "Ford will develop the hardware that runs Argo AI’s software." When Demler asked Fields about the specifics of the hardware, "I got a nod from the Argo founder, but no direct answers," he said. But the Argo AI-Ford team "will need to make the software hardware agnostic if they expect to license it," Demler stressed. "The could be a challenge." Some Ford engineers currently working on the Virtual Driver System are expected to move to Argo AI. The companies, however, declined to specify numbers. Argo AI also declined to discuss specific IPs and patents the startup will bring to Ford. Asked about how many hours of testing will be needed to make the Argo AI-based Virtual Driver System safe, Salesky said, “Testing is done in so many different prongs.  The mileage required for testing is only one of the hundreds of different prongs.” Now that it’s becoming a part of Ford, Salesky said that in order to ensure the safety of autonomous cars, “we need to collaborate with other [OEMs] and regulators like NHTSA, and work with certification process in a responsible way.”   L-R: Peter Rander, Argo AI COO; Ken Washington, Ford VP of research and advanced engineering; Mark Fields, Ford CEO; Bryan Salesky, Argo AI CEO; Raj Nair, Ford executive vice president, CTO; and Laura Merling, Ford Smart Mobility LLC VP of autonomous vehicle solutions. (Source: Ford) Tech - Auto partnerships Despite all the talk about partnerships between tech companies and automakers to jointly develop autonomous cars, remarkably, very little has happened thus far. Just before the Consumer Electronics Show in 2016 – more than a year ago, Google and Ford were rumored as potential partners in the self-driving auto race. That announcement never happened, and Ford went without an external AI partner until now.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Play Developers requested to present User Data policy By Rei Padla - February 10, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you’re an app developer, check your email inbox because you might be receiving a special notice from Google about the changes happening to the Play Store. We’re not sure when the big change will be executed but the tech giant is believed to be limiting visibility of the apps. This could mean some apps will be removed if proven they have violated the User Data policy. It’s actually just a lack of privacy policy and something that developers may have forgotten. Well, the email warning is much appreciated but we know millions of apps will be affected. This is great news though for the mobile users because it means a cleaner app store. Google is said to be deleting zombie apps that are placed on the Play Store. With Google demanding a privacy policy, there will be devs who may forget or simply dismiss the challenge. We know there will be developers, the bigger ones, who will take time to draft their policies because they don’t want their apps to be deleted. At least, there is a call now to “clean” the Play Store. There are too many apps listed that are not really useful so might as well remove them. Here is the email Google Play Developers are receiving: Hello Google Play Developer, Our records show that your app, ______, with package name com.____. _______ currently violates our User Data policy regarding Personal and Sensitive Information. Policy issue: Google Play requires developers to provide a valid privacy policy when the app requests or handles sensitive user or device information. Your app requests sensitive permissions (e.g. camera, microphone, accounts, contacts, or phone) or user data, but does not include a valid privacy policy. Action required: Include a link to a valid privacy policy on your app’s Store Listing page and within your app. You can find more information in our help center. Alternatively, you may opt-out of this requirement by removing any requests for sensitive permissions or user data. If you have additional apps in your catalog, please make sure they are compliant with our Prominent Disclosure requirements. Please resolve this issue by March 15, 2017, or administrative action will be taken to limit the visibility of your app, up to and including removal from the Play Store. Thanks for helping us provide a clear and transparent experience for Google Play users. Regards, The Google Play Team This letter obviously requires an action. We’re not expecting all will follow but at least Google did send out a warning. The issue must be resolved until March 15 of this year so you have over a month to submit to Google.

This new version of Chrome will let mobile device users enjoy 3D content from online platforms such as Matterport, with its 300,000 virtual tours (museums, palaces, celebrity homes, etc.) and the Sketchfab community, featuring around a million animations. WebVR support in Chrome will considerably boost the choice of 3D scenes, previously available via the YouTube application. Owners of Google’s Daydream View can slip their smartphone into the headset for instant immersion into all of these virtual worlds. That goes for other VR headsets currently on the market too, including Google’s famous Cardboard VR viewer. Users who don’t yet have this kind of headset can still enjoy the content by navigating around the scene using their finger on smartphone’s touchscreen. The Google Daydream View, available in selected countries, is a relatively rudimentary VR headset. Like the Cardboard viewer, it’s designed for use with a smartphone, which slides into the headset. However, it offers a more robust build than the Cardboard and comes with a remote control with a trackpad, a gyroscope and an accelerometer. Although considerably less sophisticated than the likes of the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, this type of headset seems to have a bright future in the tech market. The Daydream View sells for US$79 (RM350) in the US. Unfortunately, very few smartphones are currently compatible with the Daydream View (Google Pixel phones, the Moto Z range, the ZTE Axon 7, for example), which could explain why Google is making a conscious effort to broaden the reach of virtual reality content, making it accessible on all devices. Without that, VR technology could struggle to gain ground among the public at large. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Algorithms: the managers of our digital lives How algorithms (secretly) run the world Sony's new 4K Ultra HD TVs, Blu-ray player hit stores in March Google brings virtual reality to updated Chrome mobile browser Facebook to provide ad data for independent audit ‘Final Fantasy XV’ blends free and paid add-ons with update announcement (VIDEO) Apple to start building iPhones in India Top 2017 smartphones and new Nokia handsets expected at Mobile World Congress Singing robot and 18th Century Silver Swan star in new London exhibition (VIDEO) Watch out Batman, this bladeless bat-like drone might be faster than you (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Algorithms: the managers of our digital lives Facebook, Google bantu pengguna kesan berita palsu Gergasi internet cabar Trump, speaker UK tidak izin ucapan Facebook, Google launch fake news detecting tool in France Is it time to say ‘goodbye’ to Google Allo?

By Avi Salzman Feb. 10, 2017 5:28 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Expedia posted decent earnings on Thursday, but said some Google practices are presenting a challenge. Photo: Bloomberg News Like other Internet companies, Expedia appears to have a Google problem, and the search engine’s expanding reach could weigh on results in coming quarters. Google, owned by the Alphabet corporation, has been launching its own travel tools in recent years. In 2015, it began allowing users to book hotel rooms using Google’s interface (though the transactions were processed by third parties), and last year it released the Google Trips app that gathers travel information from users’ Gmail accounts. The search giant has also made it harder for other companies to get free exposure from searches in some cases. Google expanded the amount of spots for its paid desktop search options last year. At times it has gotten more aggressive in promoting its own services when people search, coaxing them to explore Google’s travel options first instead of immediately directing them to Priceline or Expedia. That leaves less room for other brands to promote their offerings directly. Google already has a $12 billion travel business, compared to less than $9 billion for Expedia, according to travel news and research site Skift. Much of Google’s travel-related revenue comes from charging online travel sites like Expedia to advertise. But even if Expedia is a valued Google customer, it is also a competitor, and CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has made it clear that Google has been a challenge for its HomeAway vacation rental business. Google has taken “more and more of their screen space and monetizes that screen space,” Khosrowshahi said on a conference call following the company’s fourth quarter earnings release on Thursday. “But players like ourselves don’t have much of a choice because of Google’s market power.” Big Picture: Expedia could see a growing threat from Google’s expanded travel business.

 As promised, Oracle just filed its appeal in its massive case against Google Julie Bort Feb. 10, 2017, 7:23 PM 5,093 facebook linkedin twitter email print Oracle's Larry Ellison and Safra Catz AP If you thought the loss Oracle suffered in May in its ongoing lawsuit against Google over Android was the end, think again. As promised, Oracle is appealing the case, and filed its appeal today. The two tech giants have been battling it out for years in two separate court cases over whether Google must pay Oracle billions of dollars for bits of code copied from Java (a programming language Oracle owns) and used in Android (the language Google controls). At issue were bits of code called application programming interfaces (APIs), the technology that allows different computer programs to talk to each other. While there's been back and forth over the years, with one side winning or losing various stages of the fight, the upshot is, Google has yet to be found liable for paying Oracle for Java, much less the massive, multi-billion dollar fine Oracle dreams of. Chilling effect In May, the two companies were in court arguing over what amount, if anything, Google owes after an earlier trial found that Google did in fact copy some of the Java code. Google argued that the copying fell within the "fair use" provision of copyright law, meaning Google was free to use it. A jury of 10 unanimously agreed with Google. Oracle vowed to appeal and here we are. In the appeal filing, seen by Business Insider, Oracle argues that the jury in May didn't get to hear all of the facts it wanted to share. Those facts included all the ways it believes Android harms Java, including how Android might one day usurp Java's role in its primary domain, as a language used to create apps and Web apps for PCs.  Oracle's lawyers argue in the appeal filing: “Google started trial knowing a fact it kept secret from everyone else: It was days away from announcing that 'the full functionality of Android would soon be working on desktops and laptops, not just on smartphones and tablets.'”   Many in the tech industry have been watching this case closely. Critics argue that a big fine for Oracle could have a chilling effect on some of the ways that software developers freely use and share code today. Google is not commenting on the appeal, although it did send Business Insider its original statement when it won the jury case in May. "[The] verdict that Android makes fair use of Java APIs represents a win for the Android ecosystem, for the Java programming community, and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products."

(YouTube) The Scroll OK, Google: Show Me Inclusion Why Google’s Super Bowl ad, which included a mezuzah, is an important metaphor for America By Marjorie Ingall The Scroll OK, Google: Show Me Inclusion Why Google’s Super Bowl ad, which included a mezuzah, is an important metaphor for America By Marjorie Ingall February 9, 2017 • 2:04 PM Did you miss the Google Home Super Bowl ad with the mezuzah in it because you were hanging out with activist rabbis instead of watching the game? Me, too! The ad didn’t attract a lot of notice. It first appeared online last October, and when it finally aired on TV it got more attention for making viewers’ own Google Home devices go crazy than it did for its content. (Apparently Google Home devices heard “OK, Google” repeated over and over from the TV, got confused, and acted out.) A writer for The Verge observed, “At some point, some enterprising TV writer or ad jerk is gonna plant an ‘OK Google’ into some TV with intent and force everyone to listen to Nickelback.” But, fellow yehudim, consider the ad itself. It opens with an aerial shot of a bus on a winding road. We hear the first wistful notes of a wordless, gentle instrumental version of John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads.” Then there’s a house with a rainbow flag (!) and wait, don’t get scared and change channels, look at the generic blond woman getting out of a taxi! And ooh, a cute dachshund looking out a window and whimpering eagerly for its person! And a sweet wholesome hetero fam with a sleeping toddler entering a suburban home through a tidy garage! Are you heteronormatively chill? Good! Here’s a shot of a mezuzah on a doorpost as a shoulder passes by! Ha! It’s the Jews, just 15 seconds after the gays! Shh, chill some more, look at the pretty white girl with a cello case in the rain entering her house, telling Google Home, “Turn on the hall lights.” Thanks, Google Home! Now there’s a little girl of color excitedly greeting her daddy! Oh, you’re cool, straight white Christian viewer; you’re not discomfited by the African-American dude saying “OK Google, turn up the music” and some dancing! You can do the Nae Nae! Look, there’s a Southeast Asian woman saying “OK Google, what’s a good substitute for cardamom?” Relatable! You don’t have cardamom in your spice rack either! And now it’s another cute wee brown girl giggling as her not-in-the-frame dad says, “OK Google, what sound does a whale make?” Oh, and this sweet elderly white lady asking “How do you say ‘nice to meet you’ in Spanish?” Google Home tells her, so when she opens the door to greet and hug a wholesome young Latino couple, she’s ready! Then there’s a quick montage of a bunch of Google Homes getting asked questions, then a big party of people of many races, and cake that says “Welcome Home,” and “OK Google, dim the downstairs lights!” And all the attractive multicultural people hide, and aw, it’s getting all soft-focus-y as people yell (but, like, gentle-yell) “Welcome home!” Reductive? Sure. But for me, seeing that mezuzah triggered the same feeling as spotting a friend in the crowd during a televised baseball game. I know you! It was a smidgen of what I felt during Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s JAP Battle, despite my agita about the term JAP and my dismay at stereotypes. Seeing my people represented—in such an in-group kind of way, with references many goyim would miss—was thrilling. We’re so seldom invited to the party, and here Google didn’t go for the obvious kippah or Shabbat candles, but the lesser known mezuzah. It’s like they know us! Not everyone I talked to about it felt the same way. One of my colleagues sniffed, “It’s using the perception of being inclusive to sell stuff. It’s pretty meh to laud companies just for using multiculturalism to build their brand. I mean, donate money, Google! Use your massive international clout to create a more tolerant world in a meaningful way! Provoke change!” I see where he’s coming from. But wasn’t it telling that so many big-game ads were tagged “liberal”? Coca-Cola re-ran its multi-language “America the Beautiful” spot. Airbnb showed tight close-ups of a variety of different folks of different ages, with different skin colors, along with the hashtag #WeAccept and text making that explicit: “We believe no matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love, or who you worship, we all belong.” The company’s founder and CEO tweeted that Airbnb pledged to provide short-term housing for the next five years to a hundred thousand people who need it, starting with refugees, aid workers and disaster survivors. The spot that caused the most controversy, Budweiser’s story of its founder’s immigration journey, took a year to produce. In other words, it was being storyboarded long before Trump took office. And the CEO of the lumber company that produced an ad supportive of legal immigration is a Republican Trump supporter. But all these ads convey a sense of the commandment ahavat ha’ger—love the stranger. To put it bluntly, I think there’s a feeling in the air of not wanting to be a dick. We’re yearning for connection, for bridge-building. There were even fewer sexist commercials this year than in past years. (The most provocative ads were a duo of self-aware, feminist, funny spots for T-Mobile, in which comedian Kristen Schaal enjoys a sadomasochistic relationship with Verizon. Any pussy-grabbing this character is involved in is clearly safe, sane, consensual and replete with riding crops.) Commercials are always about us as much as the product they’re selling. They’re about how we want to see ourselves, what we believe, who we love or hate, where we see our place in a wider world. I majored in folklore and mythology in college, so you’ll excuse me a flight of fancy: Commercials are similar to myths, which Joseph Campbell called “public dreams.” Campbell believed that the imagery in myths, like dreams, reveal “the deepest hopes, desires and fears, potentialities and conflicts, of the human will… Every myth, that is to say, whether or not by intention, is psychologically symbolic. Its narratives and images are to be read, therefore, not literally, but as metaphors.” The commercials we love and remember involve a brand tapping into our own longings and ways of viewing the world. I saw a mezuzah and felt welcomed. And that’s a big deal.

 Silicon Valley's immigrant tech workers are scared of buying homes after Trump's travel ban Melia Robinson Feb. 7, 2017, 11:59 AM 11,207 facebook linkedin twitter email print Melia Robinson/Business Insider A pair of married software engineers hooked up with real estate agent Tim Gullicksen about six months ago in pursuit of their dream home. After taking time to peruse the market, the couple found a multimillion-dollar single-family home in San Francisco that they loved. In January, they wrote an offer letter to the seller, complete with an attached photo of the young family, and squared away their finances. In early February, the couple told Gullicksen they would no longer place a bid. They planned to take a three-week vacation in their native country of India, and decided they couldn't risk buying a house if President Donald Trump's administration wouldn't let them back into the US. (While no such restriction exists, they worry the new administration might change its mind.) They declined to speak with Business Insider directly for fear of retribution from the government. San Francisco is one of the most competitive housing markets in the US, with a median listing price that tops $1.1 million. But foreign-born tech workers, who often commute to Silicon Valley, are starting to back out of buying property because they worry about an escalating crackdown on immigration under Trump, according to some real estate agents. Demonstrators hold signs during a rally against the travel ban at San Francisco International Airport. Stephen Lam/Getty More than 100,000 visas have been revoked since an executive order issued on January 27 temporarily banned citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the US. Real estate agents in the Bay Area tell Business Insider they started to hear rumblings among prospective buyers in late January, after Trump signed off on the immigration ban. The topic came up in company meetings, private emails, and closed groups for realtors on Facebook. Nina Hatvany, a luxury realtor with Pacific Union International, sold more houses in terms of sales volume — $216 million — than any other agent in San Francisco last year. Hatvany tells Business Insider she frequently takes on clients who originated outside the US. "I often have conversations, 'Is this a good place to put my money?' Absent earthquakes, it is," Hatvany says. "[The San Francisco Bay Area] has certainly shown tremendous appreciation, and it's a wonderful place to live. ... If people start to worry about whether they're going to be able to get into the country when they come home from vacation, that could change." Dylan Hunter, a real estate agent with Pacific Union International, said he hasn't had a client "pull the red cord" yet, but he knows immigration reform is a concern for some. He's working with a couple based in San Francisco — one is an investment banker, the other works at Google — who are in the market for a $2 million single-family home. Their relatives in India are worried the couple will never be able to visit, and vice versa. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai issued a company-wide memo last month urging staff traveling overseas to return immediately. He said 100 employees are affected by the executive order. One ripple effect of the Trump administration's policies might be a downturn in the Bay Area's housing market. Karen Yang, a real estate agent with Fling Yang & Associates, says that if H-1B visa holders (a type of visa that allows US companies to bring in foreign professionals with specialized skills) disappear from the marketplace, a sudden lack of competition could drive down the price of a single-family home in the city. Most real estate agents we spoke with, however, said their clients should not be directly impacted by the travel ban (at least for now). Jackie Cuneo, a senior loan officer at mortgage lender Summit Funding, tells Business Insider that so long as H-1B visa holders have a Social Security number, a US address, more than one year left on their visa, and a financial footprint established in the US, they're treated like citizens. It's unclear how Trump's travel ban could affect these standards, and if the rules vary for H-1B carriers who originated from one of the seven countries named in the executive order.  It also appears Trump will go after the H-1B visa directly in an attempt to open up more jobs for American workers, according to a leaked draft of a new executive order. In the hypothetical situation that an immigrant worker gets their H-1B visa revoked shortly after buying a house, they would have to pay between 6% and 7% of the home value in closing costs and transfer tax, a one-time fee imposed on the owner when a property changes hands. A real estate agent talks with potential home buyers as they look at a newly constructed condominium in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Trump's immigration ban sent shockwaves throughout the Bay Area, where technology companies rely on an international talent pool. At Facebook, more than 15% of US employees in 2016 worked for the social giant under a temporary work visa. Gullicksen, the real estate agent whose clients backpedaled because they have a vacation coming up, said the "What if?" question is ultimately what cost him the sale. "We were just about to submit an offer that was due ... today, actually," Gullicksen said. "A couple days ago, they said, 'We loved that house but we're really nervous about spending that much money and maybe not staying here."' On February 5th, 97 tech firms, including Google, Apple, and Facebook, filed a legal brief opposing the travel ban, in Silicon Valley's first united front attack on the new administration. The brief argues that the policy "inflicts significant harm on American business." Real estate agents will be keeping a close eye on what happens next.

By: AFP | Updated: February 11, 2017 1:37 pm Ford will take a majority stake in Argo AI, an AI company which started in late 2016 by former Google and Uber employees who had worked on autonomous driving. (Image for representation, Source: Reuters) Ford will invest $1 billion over five years in an artificial intelligence startup with the aim of developing an autonomous vehicle by 2021, the auto giant said. Ford will take a majority stake in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company based in Pittsburgh, started in late 2016 by former Google and Uber employees who had worked on autonomous driving. Watch all our videos from Express Technology The venture will employ leading engineers and “roboticists” to develop a “virtual driver” system, described by Ford officials as the “brain” of an autonomous vehicle. The setup is intended to give Ford a head start on competitors in the race to commercialize autonomous vehicles, said Ford executive vice president Raj Nair. “This is really unique in the industry,” Nair said on a conference call with analysts.It will have the “speed and nimbleness of a startup, but also integrated into a full production development team.” Nair said research towards full autonomy has moved “beyond the research phase,” but there remains the need for a “tremendous leap” between the driver-assist technologies now available and full autonomy. Argo AI employees will have a minority equity stake in the venture. The structure is intended to lure top engineers to the venture, Ford executives said. Ford said the investment would help it to realize a previously announced plan to introduce an autonomous vehicle for ride-hailing or ride-sharing service in 2021. Argo AI plans to hire more than 200 people at sites in Pittsburgh, Michigan and Silicon Valley, according to a press release. Argo AI and other boosters of autonomous driving argue it could make roads safer and open up mobility to the elderly and others.

However, here’s how to get YouTube Red for free. Advertisement First of all, I’m not condoning piracy here. This isn’t a way to hack into the YouTube app and get YouTube Red for free illegally. Instead, it’s just a matter of jailbreaking your iPhone (which is completely legal) and downloading a Cydia tweak that gives you the features that YouTube Red offers. If you don’t have a jailbroken iPhone or don’t want to jailbreak, there’s another option as well, but isn’t quite as streamlined. The jailbreak tweak is called YouTube ++ and it’s actually been around for a while now, long before YouTube Red even existed. It simply enables a few cool features and disables some features that users might find annoying, like ads. Read: How to Download YouTube Videos on Mac The tweak wasn’t specifically made to bypass YouTube Red’s subscription service by any means, but it’s funny how things work out. In any case, here’s how to get YouTube Red for free. What Is YouTube Red? Google has been talking about a subscription service for YouTube for a while now, but it’s finally here for users to take advantage of. Advertisement YouTube Red costs $9.99 per month and comes with a few cool features that might be worth the price for some users. Firstly, it’s completely ad-free so you won’t see any kind of ads while watching YouTube. It also comes with a few exclusive features, like offline viewing of videos that you save, as well as background audio, which allows you to start a video and then exit the app while still having the audio play. This is great for music and other videos where the video portion isn’t entirely needed. YouTube Red also comes with free access to Google Music, where you get unlimited music to listen to for free. There’s also some exclusive content for YouTube Red subscribers, with PewDiePie being one of the providers for some exclusive videos so far. These last two features you won’t be able to get with the YouTube ++ jailbreak tweak, but it’s possible you may only be interested in the other features. How to Get YouTube Red for Free If you’re not jailbroken on your iPhone and are on iOS 9.0, you can still jailbreak your device using the Pangu jailbreak tool. However, if you’re updated to iOS 9.1 or iOS 9.2, you’re unfortunately out of luck. Advertisement You’ll need to install a tweak called YouTube ++, which is found in Cydia. Lucky for you, it contains most of the features that YouTube Red has, so you can essentially get YouTube Red for free, even though you’re not truly subscribing to the service. YouTube ++ will give you the basic features in YouTube Red, including blocked ads, offline playback, and background audio. Plus, there are a handful of other features you’ll get as well, including custom forward/rewind controls, speed controls, choosing a default playback quality, and an in-app web browser. After you install YouTube ++, you can go into the YouTube app and access the Settings. From there you’ll see a Preferences button below YouTube ++ where you can access all of the different settings for the jailbreak tweak. Advertisement For Non-Jailbroken iPhones If your iPhone is not jailbroken and you can’t jailbreak it because you’re on a newer version of iOS, you’re not completely out of luck. While it’s not quite as integrated and seamless as YouTube ++, a great solution is a piece of Mac software called YouTube Converter. It’s made by a really cool development team called Softorino and we’ve talked about it in the past. To download YouTube Converter, go to this website and click Free Download. From there, install the app like you would with any other Mac app. Advertisement The app is smart enough that when you go to YouTube in your web browser and copy the URL, the app will automatically insert the clip into the converter. From there, it’s just a matter of hitting start and transferring it over to your iPhone. The videos then show up in the stock Videos app. Again, it’s not exactly true YouTube Red functionality, but hey, this is a way to watch YouTube videos without ads and without needing an internet connection. Why You Should Pay for YouTube Red So while I showed you easy ways to get YouTube Red for free, it does have its downsides. First off, YouTube ++ doesn’t work on your computer, and it will only work on the iPhone that you have the tweak installed on. Furthermore, it doesn’t give you all of the features of YouTube Red, especially the free access to Google Music. Plus, the YouTube converter app is a very rough workaround for getting YouTube Red for free. If you tend to watch YouTube videos on different devices and not solely on your jailbroken iOS device, then it might be worth it to pay for YouTube Red. This will give you an ad-free experience across all platforms that you’re on. If you watch YouTube videos a lot anyway, then $9.99 per month isn’t a bad price to pay. I have a handful of YouTube channels that I subscribe to and watch daily, so paying three cents per day for YouTube Red is a pretty great deal. Plus, you’ll be supporting your favorite content creators. So don’t think of it as giving money to Google, but rather giving money to the YouTubers that you enjoy watching. 25 Responses 01/01/2016 devan dalby Reply What about androids 02/11/2016 joob Reply well that didnt work 02/12/2016 Jacob Kenya Reply Can you do one for android please??

File photo   PTI Lucknow February 11, 2017 11:07 IST Updated: February 11, 2017 12:24 IST more-in Taking a swipe at Narendra Modi for his “raincoat in bathroom” barb at Manmohan Singh, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said the Prime Minister was more interested in “peeping into bathrooms of people“. The Congress Vice President also said that the Prime Minister will get a “jolt” once the results of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections are out. “Modi likes to read janampatri (horoscope), search Google and peep into the bathrooms of people...but he is a failure as a Prime Minister,” he said at a joint press conference with Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav where the SP-Congress alliance released a 10-point Common Minimum Programme (CMP). “He (Modi) can do this (peeping into bathrooms) in his free time,” Mr. Gandhi said. His comments come against the backdrop of the Prime Minister’s remarks in Parliament that one should learn the art of “bathing with a raincoat on” from Manmohan Singh as there was not a single taint on him despite so many scams having taken place during his regime. Mr. Modi had said in an election rally in Haridwar yesterday that BJP had a detailed dossier on the Congress leaders. “Mein Congress ke logon se kehta hoon: jabaan sambhaal kar rakho, warna mere paas aapki poori janampatri padi hui hai (hold your tongue, I have your entire horoscope). Reacting to this comment, Mr. Gandhi on Saturday dared him saying, “You are the Prime Minister for over past two years...You can take out the janmapatri of Congress and go ahead with it.” To another comment of Modi that Rahul is the “most joked about person” on Google, the Congress Vice President hit back, saying, ”...he likes to search Google and he can do so in his past time...but he has failed in his functions as PM...he will get a jolt from the results of these elections.” “(Actually) Modi’s policy is that of distraction...when he cannot give answers to issues like employment, security, demonetisation...he indulges in distraction and the whole country knows about it,” Mr. Gandhi said. He said Mr. Modi had promised to provide two lakh jobs every year and last year only one lakh youths were provided jobs and this year with the unemployment going high, things are back to square one. “Modi talks about security and terorism...the result of surgical strike has been that some 90 security personnel had to sacrifice their lives first time in seven years,” he said. Speaking at the press conference, the UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said emotions and anger were not right as these were elections for growth and prosperity of the state. “Anyone’s ‘janmpatri’ is just a click away in this age of Internet,” Mr. Akhilesh said, asking the “PM and BJP not to mislead people and come forward and tell them as to what they have given to the state which has elected all prominent NDA leaders”.

A lot of that growth is along Highway 49 North towards Brookland. “The growth has been incredible,” Jonesboro Mayor Harold Perrin said. “We have been growing the population somewhere between 4%, I’d say, and 5% in a year and I don’t see that to slow down because the things that are coming here in a spinoff to make more growth.” Perrin attributes a large part of the city’s expansion to NEA Baptist Memorial Hospital opening on Highway 49 North because a lot of that area was zoned for commercial use shortly after it opened. He believes more subdivisions will be built in that area soon also. “The same thing with [Highway] 226, when we opened up 226,” Perrin said. “I think in the Valley View area that you’re going to see a lot of commercial development in there and I think where the mall was going to go, on the 116 acres, I think that will be developed in the next few years.” Perrin thinks some of the major drivers of growth are Arkansas State University and other places that offer several jobs. “I think the increase, if you’ll look at Frito Lay, they’ve expanded, Hytrol’s expanded, the new conveyer company out on Highway 18, Post cereal, if you look at all those increases and then the medical school, then obviously that brings in a lot of people,” he said. Mayor Perrin said he thinks Jonesboro will continue to be the regional hub for medical needs, education, retail, and entertainment in Northeast Arkansas. “You get to the point like we are now, the only think you’re going to have is probably just continued growth,” he said.  Copyright 2017 KAIT.

After obtaining a loan refinance sponsorship from Fayette County, 84 Lumber Co. will ask Washington County to sponsor another loan restructuring. The company, crippled by the decline in the housing industry, must refinance its debt to survive. (Joe Appel | Tribune-Review) Olson Story 9/14/10 Barry Reeger | Trib Total Media Nemacolin Woodlands Resort President and Owner Maggie Hardy Magerko speaks about the $75 Million renovation to the resort over the past 15 months during a celebration on March 29, 2015, in Farmington, Fayette County. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Hate it or love it, 84 Lumber's pricey Super Bowl immigration commercial garnered big-time attention. The Washington County-based company's push to reach a national audience came on television's biggest — and most expensive — night of the year. And in addition to a 90-second slot just before halftime, the estimated $15 million expenditure bought widespread buzz from news outlets, on social media and around water coolers nationwide the day after the New England Patriots' 34-28 win over the Atlanta Falcons. Social media has helped make Super Bowl advertising a more viable option for smaller companies, with online exposure adding value, said Robert Gilbert, an associate professor of marketing at University of Pittsburgh's Katz Graduate School of Business. Controversial ads can get a boost by generating online interest and exposure, he said. "Can't you imagine people all over the country are saying, 'Who the heck is 84 Lumber?'" Gilbert said. "Then they go online and Google the company and learn about them." The ad depicted a Spanish-speaking woman and her young daughter's journey to reach the southern U.S. border. It directed people to see the full ad — which the commercial's Pittsburgh-based producing agency Brunner said was too controversial for Fox — at journey84.com. The nearly six-minute online version showed the mother and daughter reaching what appears to be President Donald Trump's proposed border wall. Then the pair finds 84 Lumber workers have constructed large wooden doors in the wall. The two, holding an American flag the girl has fashioned from scraps she picked up on the journey, walk through the doors into sunlight. The commercial ends with white text that reads, "The will to succeed is always welcome here," transposed over a shot of a lumber-filled pickup truck bed. It was one of several politically charged ads aired during the game, and one of the most successful, according to national media outlets. The New York Times listed the spot as among the evening's most searched ads on Google. Facebook users viewed the video 1.3 million times, according to Forbes . More than 300,000 people tried to visit 84 Lumber's website in the first minute after the TV commercial, considerably slowing the page, which could handle only 150,000 requests per minute, a spokeswoman said Sunday. Within an hour, the number climbed to 6 million. Marketwatch.com said the ad won "the title of most controversial Super Bowl commercial." The New York Post's Kyle Smith, in a piece titled, "What was 84 Lumber thinking with its Super Bowl ad?" called the spot "an unmistakable invitation to lawbreaking from a building-supplies company that, because of the industry it represents, is strongly associated with illegal immigrants." Maggie Hardy Magerko, 84 Lumber's president and owner, told Ad Week "the ad shouldn't be considered provocative at all. In fact, she says she voted for Donald Trump in the election, and the image of the door in the wall comes directly from Trump himself, who said he wanted a 'big beautiful door' in his wall, for legal immigration." 84 Lumber has more than 250 stores in 30 states and employs 4,600 people, according to its website. National political figures weighed in, too. Tom Perez, former President Barack Obama's labor secretary and a candidate to chair the national Democratic party, retweeted the ad and called it a "powerful message." "America will always be a nation that opens its doors," the tweet said. "That's who we are." A powerful message from #84Lumber . America will always be a nation that opens its doors. That's who we are. https://t.co/poLqZI8Yj7 — Tom Perez (@TomPerez) February 6, 2017 Local reaction ranged from supportive to disapproving. "84 Lumber will get none of my business," commentor Cherie Burkhart Parham Foster posted on a TribLIVE.com story about the ad. "Let them move their operations out of the country and offer jobs and 'hope' there and keep the illegal aliens out of this country." Several vowed to boycott the upscale Nemacolin Woodlands Spa and Resort in Farmington, Fayette County, which is owned by Hardy Magerko, and suggested the ad was intentionally controversial to garner national attention. But others applauded the commercial's message. "Thank you for having the courage to stand up to the bigotry, selfishness and conceit that dominate our national culture right now," commentor Peter Simonson said about the company in a post on the TribLIVE story. "I will make sure to buy from you in the future." finally got to watch the end of the #84lumber ... As a kid who moved here from Mexico at 8 years old this means everything.

Its judges score ads based on a host of strategic advertising criteria. "This spot took a long time to get to the message — and even then, it wasn't clear what the message actually was," Professor Derek Rucker, codeveloper of the strategic ad grading framework, said in a press release. But Gilbert cautioned it is hard to rate an ad's effectiveness without waiting to see how a company plays off the investment. "To really evaluate this ad, I think we need to understand what was 84 Lumber's objective," he said. "If it was to sell more 2-by-4s, then I'm not sure the ad met that objective. If it was to generate awareness and maybe some level of positive perception about the brand and to follow up with a lot of other ads that will capitalize on what this ad did, then it would seem to be pretty effective," Brunner spokesman Steve Radick said the ad was "absolutely successful" by getting people to talk about the 84 Lumber brand and the housing market, and by conveying a larger message about equal opportunity, hard work, grit and determination. "I don't think you can get a more American message than that," he said. Donald Gilliland and Kevin Zwick contributed. Michael Walton is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said the investment is in line with previous announcements on planned capital expenditures. Argo AI, which focuses on artificial intelligence and robotics, will help build what Ford calls its “virtual driver system” at the heart of the fully autonomous car Ford said last year it would develop by 2021. Until now, Ford’s investments in future transportation technology have been relatively modest, compared with those of General Motors Co and others. One of Ford’s largest such investments in the past year was $75 million to buy a minority stake in Velodyne, a manufacturer of laser-based lidar sensing systems for self-driving cars. Rival GM made a billion-dollar bet a year ago with its acquisition of Silicon Valley self-driving startup Cruise Automation. GM also invested $500 million to buy a 9-percent stake in San Francisco-based ride services firm Lyft, a competitor to Uber. “With Argo AI’s agility and Ford’s scale we’re combining the benefits of a technology start up with the experience and discipline we have at Ford,” Fields said at a press conference. Once the technology is fully developed for Ford, it could be licensed to other companies, executives said. While Ford will retain a majority of the start-up’s equity, the potential for an equity stake as Argo AI hires 200 more employees will be an advantage in recruiting talent, executives said. “They have the opportunity to run it pretty independently with a board, but because it is a separate company or subsidiary, it has the opportunity to go out and recruit with competitive compensation packages and equity,” Fields said.

The company could license its technology to other companies and sectors looking for autonomous capability in the future. Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here By Dana Hull Ford Motor is investing $1 billion in a months-old startup founded by two pioneers in the nascent autonomous vehicle sector. The Pittsburgh-based artificial intelligence company Argo AI will develop the brains -- specifically, a virtual driver system -- for the fully autonomous vehicles Ford has promised to bring to market in 2021. Founders Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander are former leaders of the self-driving car teams at Uber Technologies Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google. "This is a unique partnership," Mark Fields, Ford's chief executive officer, said in an interview. "A lot of tech companies are looking for customers and a lot of OEMs are looking for technology partners. We are getting expertise, and Argo AI is getting a customer in Ford." The investment planned for over the next five years reflects how hot the race for autonomous vehicles is getting within an industry facing other seismic shifts including electrification and ride-sharing. Self-driving vehicle startups are emerging at a frenetic pace after General Motors Co. and Uber acquired upstarts -- each with just a few dozen employees -- for hundreds of millions of dollars apiece in separate acquisitions last year. Ford's plans closely mirror Toyota Motor Corp.'s $1 billion investment over five years toward creating its own robotics and artificial intelligence research division. Toyota Research Institute was established more than a year ago and is being led by Gill Pratt, the former top robotics engineer for a US military agency. Unheard of "I never heard of Argo AI until 10 minutes ago," Eric Paul Dennis, a transportation analyst for the Center for Automotive Research, said by phone shortly after Ford’s announcement. "The way they've structured it -- with the startup maintaining independence -- sounds reasonable." Salesky led hardware development on the self-driving car project at Google. He and Rander, a former Uber engineer, have no other backers. Argo AI will function as a subsidiary of Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford for accounting purposes. The company will largely operate and hire independently and offer equity to engineers, said Raj Nair, Ford's executive vice president of global product development and its chief technical officer. Salesky will manage the Argo AI team. He’ll report to a five-member board of directors -- two from Ford, two from Argo AI and one independent director. Ford will have an unspecified majority stake in the company. Expansion plans Argo AI expects to have roughly 200 employees by the end of this year between its headquarters in Pittsburgh and offices in Southeast Michigan and the San Francisco Bay Area. Ford's crosstown rival GM in March of last year announced plans to buy Cruise Automation and later disclosed paying about $581 million at closing. The total cost of the deal would be more over time, Detroit-based GM said in July. The following month, Uber acquired Otto, a self-driving truck startup that had been founded seven months earlier, in a deal worth as much as $680 million. The initial focus for Argo AI will be to support Ford’s autonomous vehicle development and production. The company could license its technology to other companies and sectors looking for autonomous capability in the future. "When Pete and I decided to found the company, there were a lot of ways to try to fund it," Salesky said in an interview. "We are excited about the long-term commitment of Ford and the straight timeline to market. We want to make 2021 a reality." Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Smart Home by Andrew Gebhart February 10, 2017 2:21 PM PST @GebAndrew Enlarge Image Screenshot by Brian Bennett/CNET You no longer need a $130 Google Home to take full advantage of the search giant's connected tech. Teased a couple of weeks ago via a blog post, the Google Assistant on the company's own Pixel phones will now be able to control your smart home with a voice command. Simply go to the settings of the Google Assistant and pull up "Home Control" and you'll have access to the same connected tech as the Google Home. Since it was first introduced on the Google Pixel and the Google Home last year, Google's new conversational digital assistant -- aptly called Google Assistant -- has always had different capabilities on different devices. The Home can't pull up directions, for instance, but the Pixel can. Now, the Pixel's gaining some of the Home's tricks. Controlling your smart home with your phone might not sound like anything new, but Home Control gives you one place to manage your compatible devices and group them into rooms. Once you sync your devices to your Google Assistant, you can use your voice to tell your smart home what to do. Now, that command will work whether you have a Google Home or a Google Pixel.

 Microsoft donated $250,000 to Trump's inauguration before the immigration ban Shona Ghosh Feb. 8, 2017, 4:38 AM 2,168 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. ANDREW HARRER / BLOOMBERG VIA GETTY Microsoft donated $250,000 (£200,000) in cash and a similar amount in services to President Trump's inauguration, according to a report by Politico. Google and Amazon also donated an undisclosed amount and technical services, despite all three now publicly decrying Trump's immigration ban. Microsoft made its contribution on December 28, according to federal ethics filings found by Politico. Google provided a YouTube livestream of the event and an unspecified donation. Amazon also donated. Facebook did not hand over any money, but did provide Instagram photo booths and a "mini Oval Office". (According to earlier reports, Facebook built mini Oval Offices for both parties' national conventions.) Uber and Twitter told Politico they did not donate to the inauguration. Apple has yet to comment, but explicitly bowed out of participating in the Republican National Convention, pointing to Trump's controversial remarks about women and minorities. More tech firms may emerge if they donated after December 31, the cutoff date for the inauguration to file its most recent set of fundraising reports. The disclosures highlight Silicon Valley's precarious relationship with President Trump. Some of its most high-profile executives, including Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook, met with Trump shortly after his inauguration. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sits on Trump's business advisory council, though he has spent the last two weeks fending off criticism on Twitter. But Trump's executive order temporarily banning refugees and immigrants from 7 Muslim-majority countries sparked protests among the Silicon Valley rank and file. Microsoft CEO Satya Natella said there was no room for "bigotry", and the company described the move as "backwards". Google cofounder Sergey Brin said he was "outraged" by the order at a rally, while a group of Facebook employees said they would boycott flying. More than 100 tech companies, including those listed above, also filed an amicus brief last week opposing President Trump's travel ban.

People are lazy readers, whereas in videos, you can dish out valuable info in an engaging and easily-digestible manner. How do you kick it off and make your content stand out from the YouTube crowd? Check out the four most important tips on how to jumpstart and foster your channel’s visibility as a YouTube blogger. 1. Understand the Mechanics Even a preschooler knows how to start a YouTube channel – that is, you can sign up with Google and then register a channel in several clicks. However, making it work for real isn’t a cakewalk. Apart from having awesome content, you’ve got to grasp which factors YouTube’s video ranking primarily takes into consideration. The most important factors for the ranking are: The title tag info and description keywords are SEO cornerstones of your video’s visibility among the gazillions of others. It’s still plain old text that matters in YouTube search – further on, we’ll dwell upon the right ways to make it work. Watch time is a super-important factor – it shows whether people just stumbled upon your video and left after several seconds or watched the greater part or the whole of it. YouTube introduced this algorithm to crack down on those who used to buy fake views to bolster the total volume of views for higher rankings. The number of subscribers, likes and dislikes, comments and shares are another litmus test that shows whether users actually care about your content. Such self-evident things as the channel name, proper category, profile image and channel art matter as well. Make your channel name as memorable, unique and up-to-the-point as possible – you don’t want it to be generic lest you go unnoticed forever. When selecting channel art, remember to position the name and logo so that they’d be visible across all devices. 2. Master Title and Description SEO SEO experts suggest that you don’t skimp on video descriptions – because so far, YouTube knows what your videos are about only thanks to the surrounding text. More text means more keywords, both target ones and long tail ones. Do some research using, for instance, Google Trends, and pick out the most relevant keywords for your niche. Also, keep in mind that Google search favors some keywords more than others: the former are video-specific, so they will give your content a chance to feature among first-page video results. Moreover, your account’s Advanced Settings section allows you to enter channel keywords – make sure you don’t miss it. Avoid misleading tags and keywords like the plague – if viewers find that your content actually has nothing to do with their query, you’ll earn nothing but a bad name. 3. Leverage Annotations and Captions A call-to-action included in both descriptions and video annotations also plays an important part in your video’s SEO ranking. Make sure you place it unobtrusively yet effectively, and get ready to welcome new subscribers with more awesome content! As for transcribing your videos, it’s far from mere busywork – Google and YouTube do index transcripts! Besides, adding captions will show your audience that you care for them – in case they have to view your blog in mute mode, they can still read the content; this gives you an edge over competitors who didn’t go that extra mile. 4. Share Across Different Communities To naturally increase your content’s visibility, enable automatic sharing of new content via your Facebook and Twitter profiles. In addition, join various discussions to which your video can be a valuable contribution. People frown at links in comments, but they usually favor videos – as long as they are relevant, of course. Hopefully, you’ve got an insight into what you should consider in building your YouTube strategy. Best of luck implementing it! Get An Awesome Life I'm in!

 Silicon Valley's immigrant tech workers are scared of buying homes after Trump's travel ban Melia Robinson Feb. 7, 2017, 11:59 AM 11,207 facebook linkedin twitter email print Melia Robinson/Business Insider A pair of married software engineers hooked up with real estate agent Tim Gullicksen about six months ago in pursuit of their dream home. After taking time to peruse the market, the couple found a multimillion-dollar single-family home in San Francisco that they loved. In January, they wrote an offer letter to the seller, complete with an attached photo of the young family, and squared away their finances. In early February, the couple told Gullicksen they would no longer place a bid. They planned to take a three-week vacation in their native country of India, and decided they couldn't risk buying a house if President Donald Trump's administration wouldn't let them back into the US. (While no such restriction exists, they worry the new administration might change its mind.) They declined to speak with Business Insider directly for fear of retribution from the government. San Francisco is one of the most competitive housing markets in the US, with a median listing price that tops $1.1 million. But foreign-born tech workers, who often commute to Silicon Valley, are starting to back out of buying property because they worry about an escalating crackdown on immigration under Trump, according to some real estate agents. Demonstrators hold signs during a rally against the travel ban at San Francisco International Airport. Stephen Lam/Getty More than 100,000 visas have been revoked since an executive order issued on January 27 temporarily banned citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the US. Real estate agents in the Bay Area tell Business Insider they started to hear rumblings among prospective buyers in late January, after Trump signed off on the immigration ban. The topic came up in company meetings, private emails, and closed groups for realtors on Facebook. Nina Hatvany, a luxury realtor with Pacific Union International, sold more houses in terms of sales volume — $216 million — than any other agent in San Francisco last year. Hatvany tells Business Insider she frequently takes on clients who originated outside the US. "I often have conversations, 'Is this a good place to put my money?' Absent earthquakes, it is," Hatvany says. "[The San Francisco Bay Area] has certainly shown tremendous appreciation, and it's a wonderful place to live. ... If people start to worry about whether they're going to be able to get into the country when they come home from vacation, that could change." Dylan Hunter, a real estate agent with Pacific Union International, said he hasn't had a client "pull the red cord" yet, but he knows immigration reform is a concern for some. He's working with a couple based in San Francisco — one is an investment banker, the other works at Google — who are in the market for a $2 million single-family home. Their relatives in India are worried the couple will never be able to visit, and vice versa. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai issued a company-wide memo last month urging staff traveling overseas to return immediately. He said 100 employees are affected by the executive order. One ripple effect of the Trump administration's policies might be a downturn in the Bay Area's housing market. Karen Yang, a real estate agent with Fling Yang & Associates, says that if H-1B visa holders (a type of visa that allows US companies to bring in foreign professionals with specialized skills) disappear from the marketplace, a sudden lack of competition could drive down the price of a single-family home in the city. Most real estate agents we spoke with, however, said their clients should not be directly impacted by the travel ban (at least for now). Jackie Cuneo, a senior loan officer at mortgage lender Summit Funding, tells Business Insider that so long as H-1B visa holders have a Social Security number, a US address, more than one year left on their visa, and a financial footprint established in the US, they're treated like citizens. It's unclear how Trump's travel ban could affect these standards, and if the rules vary for H-1B carriers who originated from one of the seven countries named in the executive order.  It also appears Trump will go after the H-1B visa directly in an attempt to open up more jobs for American workers, according to a leaked draft of a new executive order. In the hypothetical situation that an immigrant worker gets their H-1B visa revoked shortly after buying a house, they would have to pay between 6% and 7% of the home value in closing costs and transfer tax, a one-time fee imposed on the owner when a property changes hands. A real estate agent talks with potential home buyers as they look at a newly constructed condominium in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Trump's immigration ban sent shockwaves throughout the Bay Area, where technology companies rely on an international talent pool. At Facebook, more than 15% of US employees in 2016 worked for the social giant under a temporary work visa. Gullicksen, the real estate agent whose clients backpedaled because they have a vacation coming up, said the "What if?" question is ultimately what cost him the sale. "We were just about to submit an offer that was due ... today, actually," Gullicksen said. "A couple days ago, they said, 'We loved that house but we're really nervous about spending that much money and maybe not staying here."' On February 5th, 97 tech firms, including Google, Apple, and Facebook, filed a legal brief opposing the travel ban, in Silicon Valley's first united front attack on the new administration. The brief argues that the policy "inflicts significant harm on American business." Real estate agents will be keeping a close eye on what happens next.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Android Things Developer Preview 2 rolls out, adds machine learning to IoT platform By John Hoff - February 10, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Android Things is the evolution of Brillo, which we’ve talked about before. Google needs an internet-of-things (IoT) platform, and Android Things seems to be the software platform they’re banking on for this niche of the market. While waiting for the first release, developers get to test out the second Developer Preview that just rolled out. Android Things Developer Preview 2 has some new features to flaunt coming from the initial version. The new DP now has USB audio support for the Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi 3 devices. There’s also the addition of TensorFlow, which is really the highlight feature of this version. This feature allows for machine learning and computer vision to be applied to an IoT platform. In Google’s example, a device can access a camera and TensorFlow will allow it to perform object recognition and image classification which activates the machine learning part of the platform. This opens up a lot of possibilities for the platform. The developer preview can be downloaded from the official download pages. There are devices where you can test the preview now, like the Raspberry Pi. If you need to test it out, go for it and tell us about it.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: opopododo Samsung just trademarked ‘Hello’ Mike Wehner @MikeWehner February 9th, 2017 at 1:13 PM Share Tweet Virtual assistants are all the rage these days, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to make it through an entire day without uttering “Hey Siri,” “Ok Google,” or “Alexa…,” so it’s no surprise that Samsung has its own voice-controlled helper called Bixby on the way. Bixby has been leaked several times, including by Samsung itself, so we know it’s coming, but a new trademark filed by the company sounds an awful lot like a virtual assistant itself — or, at the very least, a feature that could be used in tandem with Bixby. It’s called “Hello.” Don't Miss: A $1,000 iPhone 8 would be Apple’s most courageous move yet The trademark application, which Samsung filed with the European Union Intellectual Property Office, describes Samsung Hello thusly: “Computer software, namely, software that enables users of computers and mobile devices to access, aggregate, organize and interact with content, information and images and topics of general interest to such users; Application software that provides personalized features and information based on user’s preferences in the fields of weather, music, entertainment, games, travel, science, health, contact, and social news; Computer software for scheduling and managing appointments, reminders, events and calendar entries on an electronic calendar; Computer software for organizing and accessing phone numbers, addresses, and other personal contact information; Application software that provides personalized features and information based on user’s preferences in the fields of weather, music, entertainment, games, travel, science, health, contact, and social news via voice command and voice recognition.” Okay, so it’s a personal news and app aggregator that caters its content to the habits and preferences of the user, while using voice commands and voice recognition to produce information related to weather, social media, entertainment, games, and other stuff. It can look up calendar info and reminders, and schedule alerts. It also has access to your personal information like phone numbers and address lists. It’s a bit hard to know what to make of this, since the description of Hello is pretty much exactly what most modern virtual assistants provide. It’s possible that Hello is Samsung’s official name for Bixby — Bixby was earlier reported to be the name for the male version of the assistant, with Kestra being the female counterpart — or that Hello is just a feature within Bixby’s larger umbrella. We’ll likely have to wait until Samsung is ready to officially unveil its next crop of Galaxy devices before we know for certain.

In an effort to expedite that process, it acquired a Pittsburgh start-up featuring industry standouts Bryan Salesky — who worked on a self-driving car project at Google — and Peter Rander — who did similar work with Uber. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint SAN FRANCISCO – Ford Motor is spending $1 billion to take over a budding robotics start-up to acquire more expertise needed to reach its ambitious goal of having a fully driverless vehicle on the road by 2021. The big bet announced Friday comes just a few months after the Pittsburgh start-up, Argo AI, was created by two alumni of Carnegie Mellon University's robotics program, Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander. The alliance between Argo and Ford is the latest to combine the spunk and dexterity of a technologically savvy start-up with the financial muscle and manufacturing know-how of a major automaker in the race to develop autonomous vehicles. Last year, General Motors paid $581 million to buy Cruise Automation, a 40-person software company that is testing vehicles in San Francisco. The Argo deal marks the next step in Ford's journey toward building a vehicle without a steering wheel or brake pedal — a vision CEO Mark Fields laid out last summer. The big-ticket deal for the newly minted company clearly was aimed at getting Salesky and Rander. Salesky formerly worked on self-driving cars at a high-profile project within Google — now known as Waymo — and Rander did the same kind of engineering at ride-hailing service Uber before the two men teamed to launch Argo late last year. "When talent like that comes up, you don't ignore that ability," said Raj Nair, who doubles as Ford's chief technical officer and product development head. The two will develop the core technology of Ford's autonomous vehicle — the "virtual driver" system, which Nair described as the car's "brains, eyes, ears and senses." The decision to turn to Argo for help is a tacit acknowledgment that Ford needed more talent to deliver on Fields' 2021 promise, said one expert familiar with Salesky and Rande. "This is likely a realization that Ford is behind relative to companies like GM, Audi, Volvo, Waymo and Uber, and is trying to catch up," said Raj Rajkumar, a Carnegie Mellon computer engineering professor who leads the school's autonomous vehicle research. Salesky said Argo expects to have 200 workers by the end of the year. Argo employees will be given stock in the subsidiary as part of their compensation packages so they will be enriched if Argo's technology becomes a hot commodity. The equity should set Argo apart from other companies in recruiting scarce tech workers. "There's a war for talent out there," Fields said. By joining with Ford, Argo gets strong capital backing and expertise on other components needed to run autonomous cars, as well as product development and manufacturing knowledge, Salesky said. In return for its funding, Argo will design its driverless system exclusively for Ford and then have a chance to license the technology to other automakers in the future. Ford isn't just racing General Motors and other automakers to gain robotics experience. Uber bought autonomous trucking start-up Otto for an estimated $680 million last summer primarily to get Otto's engineers on its team working on driverless vehicles. Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski, another former Google engineer, is now overseeing Uber's testing of driverless cars in Pittsburgh and Arizona.

YouTube logo Google's video powerhouse YouTube has finally started rolling out an in-app, mobile live-streaming feature, according to the company's blog. YouTube creators with more than 10,000 subscribers will now be able to launch livestreams directly from the YouTube app; although, the company says it intends to roll out the feature across a broader user base soon. While YouTube's decision to finally dive into the live-streaming market is news enough, marketers may be even more interested in the platform's simultaneous launch of YouTube Super Chat. Super Chat is a commenting tool that allows viewers to pay to pin their comments to live streams. These saved comments can last up to five hours, depending on the amount paid, and are moderated by the streamer. Revenue from Super Chats is split between YouTube and the streamer, similar to how marketers use AdSense today. The feature aims to garner engagement between content creators and viewers while also giving creators a way to monetize streams. Super Chat will be available to users viewing live streams via the YouTube mobile app. Paid comments aren't exactly new to the live streaming world, but such a feature on such a massive video platform is unprecedented. Brands like Lego, PlayStation, and Red Bull already have millions of subscribers, many of whom could come into a live stream through a push notification (YouTube notifies users of new content from their subscribed channels) and pay to have their comments read by the brand and audience, alike. Brands could potentially do the same with their video influencer clients.

 REVEALED: This is what secretive billion-dollar startup Magic Leap has been working on Kif Leswing Feb. 10, 2017, 7:50 PM 34,961 facebook linkedin twitter email print Magic Leap, the $4.5 billion startup backed by Google building technology that "augments" human vision with digital imagery, is scrambling to finish a working prototype before an important board meeting next week. Here is the first public photo of a working prototype of Magic Leap's portable augmented reality device, which was given to Business Insider by a source. Business Insider We attempted to authenticate this information with Magic Leap but the company declined to comment by time of publication.  This early prototype was described to Business Insider as "PEQ0." PEQ is a term that Magic Leap uses to describe its current prototype. The photo is what the device looked like as of early January, and the source said there have been improvements to the prototype since then. The board will see a carefully planned demo of the "PEQ" by CEO Rony Abovitz next week, using equipment that looks more finished, with belt packs instead of a backpack, the person said. Abovitz explained a bit about the development process for the prototype in an email sent to employees. The email was in response to a December report published by The Information that called into question whether Magic Leap's technology could be sufficiently miniaturized and commercialized to fulfill the company's promises. Abovitz wrote in the December memo (bolded portion his own):  "I used a PEQ0b (our 3rd mini-production run) about a week ago. We still have more cycles to go (PEQ1-PEQ5), but it was awesome. In 2014 (just over 2 years ago) we were still in a little warehouse-strip mall thingy and just rolling into the DCOTA, and just turning on the first WDx series (WD1, WD2, WD3, etc.). We now have a working factory and PEQ systems in hand. We only have one response that matters. Ignore all of this. Focus on what we are doing, and we ship a great product. That will speak loudly and reverberate for many years."  As Business Insider previously reported, the board meeting next week is seen as a milestone in the product's development, and a chance to prove that Magic Leap can shrink its technology to fit inside the smaller form factor that will be released to the public. But the prototype is a long way from being a market-ready product or from being truly portable — the person's left hand in the photo is holding a large battery pack, for example. Magic Leap has raised $1.39 billion dollars in venture capital, valuing the company at $4.5 billion, from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Google, JPMorgan, Fidelity and Alibaba.

Planet, Inc already has 60 shoebox-sized 'Doves' observing our planet, each capable of medium resolution of 3-5 meters. Istanbul is pictured, on September 29, 2016, captured by Terra Bella's craft 300,000 IMAGES EVERY DAY With 60 satellites in orbit, approximately 1.6TB, or around 300,000 images, are produced every day.  Within 2016 alone, we expect to have collected over 9B km2 of imagery – or 60 times the amount of all of the Earth’s landmass.   Planet will launch its new satellites on Valentine's Day from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, India, and if things go to plan, it will operate a total of 143 satellites—the most of any company in the world The fleet will be deployed on February 14, heading for an altitude of 500 km (310 miles). And, they will be combined with the 12 satellites of Flock 2p to create a 100-satellite 'line scanner' that will work with the firm's RapidEye satellites to capture daily images of the entire Earth. The craft are expected to be fully operational by this coming summer, according to The Atlantic. The firm has already made a name for itself with stunning images of the Earth captured by its fleet of Dove satellites, which are built in-house.

The firm also recently bought Google's in-house satellite business Terra Bella, adding their SkySat constellation of 7 satellites, capable of sub-meter resolution, to the fleet. This latter high-resolution craft can detect pixels that are 90 centimetres to a side, The Atlantic reports. The multi-year contract will also allow Google to use Earth-imaging data from Planet.  'You can use the medium-resolution constellation to scan the planet every day, and then – say you see a plane crash or a flood in a town – you can use the high-resolution satellites to snap those changes,' Will Marshall, co-founder and CEO of planet, told The Atlantic. 'If we see a change in the middle of Siberia, in some field, we won't point the high-resolution satellite at that. 'But if we detect some change in downtown Kiev, it might be good to have a high-resolution image.' The latest batch of Doves being deployed into orbit from the International Space Station, in pictures captured by JAXA astronaut, Takuya Onishi, from onboard the ISS. 'We believe that if we can image everywhere on earth on a weekly or daily basis, we’ll be able to see change as it happens, and change the way people make decisions,' Planet's Karthik Govindhasamy said. 'Imaging the entire planet at high resolution requires a huge constellation of satellites all capturing data at the same time.  'To get this many satellites into orbit, Planet has taken a radically different approach from traditional earth observation satellite companies: we needed to dramatically reduce the cost of each satellite, iterate satellite design quickly, and deliver the most capable satellite per kilogram ever.  'In short, we needed to practice something we call ‘agile aerospace’. '  HOW THE DOVES WILL FLY The solar powered, shoebox-sized Dove satellites are each equipped with radio antennas that allow them to communicate with ground station on Earth multiple times a day, according to Planet. They also have an array of optics and sensors, including a main camera that captures images at 3-5 meter resolution Planet's new satellite constellation will have two components - the small, cheaply made Dove satellites, and the larger Terra Bella satellites. This will allow them to capture medium resolution images daily, along with higher resolution views to track particular moments or changes. The fleet of 88 new Dove satellites will be deployed on February 14, heading for an altitude of 500 km (310 miles). And, they will be combined with the 12 satellites of Flock 2p to create a 100-satellite 'line scanner' that will work with the firm's RapidEye satellites to capture daily images of the entire Earth. Planet has also obtained Terra Bella, adding their SkySat constellation of 7 satellites, capable of sub-meter resolution, to the fleet. The SkySat craft can capture high-resolution color and near-infrared. It achieves 90 centimeter resolution, and has a two-dimensional sensor array equipped with a proprietary image filter The new fleet will be combined with the 12 satellites of Flock 2p to create a 100-satellite 'line scanner' that will work with the firm's RapidEye satellites to capture daily images of the entire Earth The solar powered, shoebox-sized Dove satellites are each equipped with radio antennas that allow them to communicate with ground station on Earth multiple times a day, according to Planet. They also have an array of optics and sensors, including a main camera that captures images at 3-5 meter resolution. These craft photograph the surface continuously, and complete an orbit roughly every 90 minutes. And, their ‘star camera’ allows for the correct positioning of the image on Earth. The SkySat craft can capture high-resolution color and near-infrared. It achieves 90 centimeter resolution, and has a two-dimensional sensor array equipped with a proprietary image filter. With this, the craft can capture multiple frames per second, which are later stitched together on the ground.  Currently, Planet's 60 orbiting satellites produce roughly 300,000 images every day. In 2016 alone, the fleet collected a dataset of imagery roughly the equivalent of 60 times the amount of Earth's landmass, according to the firm. And, the addition of the new satellites will bring their capabilities even further. The satellite industry has long been working toward the goal of photographing every area on the planet every day – and, with this latest move, Planet will be the first to achieve the goal.  Planet has now revealed it will be acquiring Google's in-house satellite business Terra Bella, adding their SkySat constellation of 7 satellites, capable of sub-meter resolution, to the fleet.

SUBSCRIBE Google image search lead Randy Keller jumps to Pinterest Image search and discovery are at the center of the user experience. Greg Sterling on February 10, 2017 at 7:41 pm More In its early days Pinterest was described as a “social scrapbooking” or photo sharing site. CEO Ben Silbermann has called it a “catalog of ideas.” But the company has generally shunned the “social network” label. Whatever else it is, Pinterest is increasingly becoming an image search engine. Accordingly, the company announced the hiring of Randy Keller, who until last month was a senior engineer working on Google image search. Keller was at Google for roughly a decade and was part of the Image Search Quality team. His Linkedin profile says he lead a team “of 40 engineers  . . . and was responsible for image search ranking, related images, guided search efforts and new emerging features like ‘Where to Buy’ and images appearing on web search.” Pinterest provided a quote from Keller about why he’s joining the company: Pinterest is the most exciting opportunity in visual discovery today, and I look forward to contributing my expertise in image search quality and ranking to the team responsible for helping millions of people discovery billions of ideas every day. Pinterest’s unprecedented data set presents new opportunities to build the next generation of search that’s personalized to each person on Pinterest. Pinterest has been doing interesting and sophisticated things with visual search and discovery for the past several years. This week Pinterest launched smartphone-camera based search tool Lens: Just point Lens at a pair of shoes, then tap to see related styles or even ideas for what else to wear them with. Or try it on a table to find similar designs, and even other furniture from the same era. You can also use Lens with food. Just point it at broccoli or a pomegranate to see what recipes come up. Patterns and colors can also lead you in fun, interesting or even just plain weird new directions. Many companies over the past decade have unsuccessfully sought to introduce similar visual search and shopping tools. Amazon has a similar tool in its mobile app; however it has de-emphasized the capability. Pinterest may be the first company able to mainstream camera-based product search. Two years ago the company announced that 80 percent of its traffic came from mobile devices. About The Author Greg Sterling Greg Sterling is a Contributing Editor at Search Engine Land.

The Pittsburgh-based artificial intelligence company Argo AI will develop the brains--specifically, a virtual driver system--for the fully autonomous vehicles Ford has promised to bring to market in 2021. Founders Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander are former leaders of the self-driving car teams at Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Uber Technologies Inc. “This is a unique partnership,” Mark Fields, Ford’s chief executive officer, said in an interview. “A lot of tech companies are looking for customers, and a lot of OEMs are looking for technology partners. We are getting expertise, and Argo AI is getting a customer in Ford.” Ford’s investment, planned for over the next five years, reflects how hot the race for autonomous vehicles is within an industry facing other seismic shifts, including electrification and ride-sharing. Self-driving vehicle startups are emerging at a frenetic pace after General Motors Co. and Uber valued upstarts--each with just a few dozen employees--as worth hundreds of millions of dollars in separate acquisitions last year. Salesky, who worked on the self-driving car project at Google, and Rander, who held a similar role at Uber, have no other backers. Argo AI will function as a subsidiary of Ford, though the startup will be independent and offer equity to engineers, said Raj Nair, Ford’s executive vice president of global product development and its chief technical officer.

Its initial focus will be to support Ford’s autonomous vehicle development and production. The company could license its technology to other companies and sectors looking for autonomous capability in the future. “When Pete and I decided to found the company, there were a lot of ways to try to fund it,” Salesky said in an interview. “We are excited about the long-term commitment of Ford and the straight timeline to market.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here By Ritesh Jain Oh, these crazy rules! Believe it or not, in his effort to boost low-cost real estate, the Finance Minister has just ended up putting a Rs 2 crore home in the 'affordable housing' category, and how! The question is, how many people can really afford it. Food for thought, this weekend. But hey! I have some more. Any idea why Pakistan stock market is doing so well despite all the problems infesting the nation and the economy? Make a wild guess, and then read on. Good way to hook you? Do read and have a great weekend ahead! A Rs 2 cr house affordable housing? The Union Budget on February 1 was supposed to be a gamechanger for the struggling housing sector. But the fineprint throws up a different picture. Going by the definition of 'affordable housing', a Rs 2 crore home in Mumbai and a Rs 1.5 crore home in Bangalore will now fit this category. It's a cruel irony for the 20 million families looking for a roof over their heads, 95 per cent of whom cannot afford to buy a house beyond Rs 10 lakh. Going by the promise of 'Housing for all by 2022' made in the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna in 2015, 3 million units should have been completed each year. The ground reality is completion of just 19,255 units in the first year. The challenge before the Finance Minister is to move a tribe of developers focused on premium housing projects to build homes for the poor. The real beneficiary, as of now, seems to be the developers, who can cash in on the subsidies and incentives that come with the catering to this segment. Introduction of carpet area, overriding the prevailing definition of built-up area was a big change in the Budget. Thus, a carpet area of 30 square metres in the four big metros and of 60 square metres in smaller cities make an affordable house. A 30-square-metre carpet-area home in Mumbai or Delhi, with loading and exemptions, translates into a 500-square- foot one bedroom-hall-kitchen, while a 60-square- metre affordable unit in Bangalore can be pushed up to a 1,000-square- foot two-bedroom house. At Rs 40,000 a square foot in Mumbai's Parel area, the affordable unit could be sold at Rs 2 crore; or at Rs 15,000 per square foot, a budget home in Bangalore could fetch Rs 1.5 crore to the builder. Other proposals that benefit the builders are tax relief on unsold stock and tax break for one year after receiving the completion certificate. Has the government defeated the very purpose of the measure by defining affordable by size rather than a cap on cost? Are these signs of desperation where the government has chewed more than it can eat? Significantly, the home buyer has got very little benefit in this Budget. The incentives are clearly loaded on the supply side and designed to construct more and cheaper homes. Whether this will come about is yet to be seen. Read More Pak economy a pleasant surprise When you put 'Pakistan' in Google news search, the leading entries referred are either to terrorism issues or to the possible extension of President Donald Trump's travel ban. Yet, Karachi Stock Exchange has put up a good performance, rising 46 per cent over last year. The economy is growing steadily in the 4-5 per cent range with the country's debt-to-GDP although high at 60 per cent, not different from that in India. In fact, India and Pakistan shared a lot of similar characteristics with a burgeoning middle class, common history, culture and even same per capita GDP till 2008, when Pakistan's growth stalled abruptly and India took off. Pakistan's recent improvement matters, because with approximately 200 million people, it is the sixth most populous country in the world. It is also a nuclear power. The education system is poor, exports are not making progress and rely too heavily on textiles, investment is insufficient, and much of the country has a series of interlocking problems with weather, water and drought. So what is the reason behind this market buoyancy. I think it has to do with huge Chinese investment under one belt one road (OBOR). Pakistan has a GDP of $270 billion and when China pledged $46 billion in soft loans and investments in a so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, markets were bound to take note. Read More Alexa-an exasperated parents' guide I am not tech-savvy and first time I heard about Alexa was in the series Mr Robot (I like those conspiracy-type things), where a lonely FBI agent after a hard day's work goes home and calls out Alexa, the voice-activated assistant built into the Echo speaker needing a Wi-Fi access to give you an answer for anything which is not abstract... and you have something to talk to in case you are feeling lonely. So, when a seven-year-old boy thought it would be funny if he asked a burning question to Alexa, "Alexa, what is poop?" After a pause, the speaker gamely replied: "Defecation is the final act of digestion, by which organisms eliminate solid, semisolid, and/or liquid waste material from the digestive tract via the anus." (The definition comes from Wikipedia.). Read More NRIs: New locomotive of Indian realty The global population of the NRI community is around 30 million, equal to the population of Canada. They are financially an advanced community, investing in various sectors in India and abroad and constitute a significant source of foreign capital inflow coming to India. NRI investment in the residential market has aggressively moved up the curve since 2014. In 2016 the total investment by the community in the Indian primary residential markets in top eight major cities amounted to $9.6 billion. And this number is expected to be $11.5 billion in 2017 as per square yard, amounting to 20 per cent of the total market share, that is about $60 billion. In the Indian community, real estate holds a very emotional and prestigious place. Over 20 per cent of the investment comes from UAE followed by the US and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The gross transaction value (GTV) of the deals has varied from $0.56 to 1.06 million with the maximum transaction value and volume happening in January and February. Demonetisation along with other significant initiative like RERA is helping build confidence in the Indian government. It will help usher in an era of unparalleled transparency and attract investments giving buoyancy to the ongoing NRI investment trends. In my view constant depreciation of Indian currency and rising real estate prices in past have played a big part in their investment decision taking and it remains to be seen whether this trend continues in absence of currency weakness and flat real estate prices.

Steve Dent, @stevetdent 19h ago in Wearables Comments 564 Shares Share Tweet Share Save One of the new features on Android Wear 2.0 is Smart Reply, which suggests responses to messages that you can quickly tap if you're busy doing something else. In its research blog, Google explained that the feature uses on-device machine intelligence, so it works even if you don't have an internet cloud connection. While the researchers initially thought doing that would be impossible, the "Expander" AI team saw it as a unique opportunity. "[We] returned to the drawing board to design a completely new, lightweight, machine learning architecture -- not only to enable Smart Reply on Android Wear, but also to power a wealth of other on-device mobile applications," the team wrote. It tried using current neural net tech and so-called graph learning, but the models didn't fit on a smartwatch and attempts to limit the number of replies "did not produce useful results," they wrote. In an attempt to make it more compact, the researchers built a simpler system that groups messages requiring a similar responses, like "Hey, how's it going?" and "How's it going buddy," rapidly and with a low memory hit. From there, it uses "semi-supervised graph learning" that checks your replies to messages, word and phrase similarity and other factors to predict the best possible replies. The entire model, including the training, resides and performs "completely on device," the team notes. "The model can also be adapted to cater to the user's writing style and individual preferences to provide a personal experience." The researchers were surprised at how well it works on Android Wear devices, which aren't renowned as computing powerhouses, and plans to use the AI algorithms behind it to "enable completely new applications in the months to come." As with Google's very similar Gmail-based smart replies, however, be sure to only use it when needed -- even with AI smarts, the person on the other end can tell it's not you.

An entry in the ‘Write in Georgian Contest’. Photo from official website of ‘Write in Georgian’. The following is a partner post from EurasiaNet.org by Monica Ellena. Republished with permission. Dato Dolidze’s fingers move slowly on the old handset as he writes a text message to his son. “My phone only has the Latin alphabet, so every time I text I need to translate the Georgian letters into the Latin. It’s a pain,” says the 50-something orange vendor at a Tbilisi vegetable market. While newer smartphones enable the use of the Georgian alphabet, many in Georgia – where the average wage is $333 a month – are, like Dolidze, stuck with cheaper, older phones. Georgia’s unique alphabet is one of the unintended casualties of such digital compromises. The curvy Georgian alphabet has seduced scholars and calligraphers for centuries, most recently the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. Last December, UNESCO included the Georgian alphabet in the organization’s register of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity. Georgian in fact features three scripts – the mkhedruli, the one commonly used today, and the ancient asomtavruli and nushkhuri, used mainly in religious scripts, and in most ancient documents. The three scripts, UNESCO wrote in its citation, “coexist thanks to their different functions, reflecting an aspect of Georgia’s diverse cultural identity.” The Georgian alphabet is hardly in imminent danger. But it is a linguistic underdog, used only for Georgian and related languages in Georgia like Mingrelian and Svan, spoken by about 3.7 million people, or 0.06 percent of the world population. And with minor languages around the world dying at the rate of one every 14 days, some in Georgia are trying to make sure their language or alphabet is preserved for the long haul. “Minor languages are particularly vulnerable today thus need protection,” says Nino Doborjginidze, who heads the Institute of Linguistic Studies at Tbilisi’s Ilia Chavchavadze State University. “A lack of technology development for such languages, including Georgian, in turn, impedes international dissemination of valuable Georgian-language data surviving in different media, oral, manuscript and printed.” Of the 7,100 languages currently in use worldwide, only 500 are used online while only 348 are supported by Google, the world’s leading search engine, according to a UNESCO report published in 2015. And even many of those languages that do make it on the Internet have limitations: Georgian, for example, is represented by only a single font on Microsoft Word. As a result of Georgia’s limited online reach, Latin script is often used instead. Retail companies as well as service providers, for example, tend to use the Latin alphabet in their promotional texts. “25% p’asdaklebas akhal ch’amosvlis” instead of “25% ფასდაკლებას ახალ ჩამოსვლის” (25% off on new arrivals). Private initiatives have emerged to bolster Georgia’s web presence. In 2015, industrial designer Zviad Tsikolia teamed up with Georgia’s largest lender, TBC Bank, and launched the contest #WriteinGeorgian, calling on volunteers’ creativity to create new styles for the alphabetic characters. Georgians responded enthusiastically, with 160 new fonts submitted in five weeks. “Our language and our alphabet is our heritage; it is a treasure that needs to be not only protected but also kept alive and updated,” explains Tsikolia, 45, a staunch advocate of using the Georgian script in day-to-day digital communication. “The world is becoming increasingly digital, and our characters must be able to evolve and adapt to a reality that is no longer just on paper.” By March, all the fonts will be available on the contest’s website for open-source download, Tsikolia said. “The future is glocal, global citizens who value national traditions,” notes Tsikolia. “Switching to the Georgian keyboard takes two seconds, but many people cannot be bothered even to do that,” Tsikolia says. Neighboring Armenia faces similar challenges, as it also has a unique language with an alphabet used solely for Armenian. “Transliteration is common, especially among the vast diaspora, but not only,” explains Gegham Vardanyan, editor-in-chief of the media discussion platform media.am. “It is not only the Latin script, Armenians in Russia will communicate in Armenian using the Cyrillic script. The result is just bizarre, often you just cannot understand it.” As in Georgia, enthusiasts have taken the initiative. Zohrab Yeganyan, press officer at Armenia’s human rights ombudsman, grew tired of seeing Armenian ill-treated on the web and vented on his Facebook page. “Let’s make February 7 the day to write Armenian on the Internet,” he wrote in a 2012 post. The response was overwhelming, both in Armenia and among the diaspora. “There were people who only spoke Armenian and decided to learn how to write in Armenian, starting with posts on social networks,” Yeganyan told EurasiaNet from Yerevan. Yeganyan said that while the Armenian government has been relatively inactive in supporting the alphabet, there are signs that the private sphere is increasingly embracing it. “Recently one mobile company started sending texts to its customers in the Armenian script, switching from the Latin alphabet,” he said. The popular push has supported the national scripts to become fashionable again, Yeganyan argues, as people have grown to realize that their particular alphabets are uniquely suited to represent the sounds of their language. “Transliteration is no longer trendy,” says Yeganyan. Nowadays, he says, “it is often used to ridicule something or someone.” Share this: twitter facebook reddit googleplus Email Print version  Written byEurasiaNet.org Recent Central Asia & Caucasus Stories 2 hours agoGeorgia Protecting Georgia's Ancient Alphabet in a Digital Age 17 hours agoArmenia Travel Blogger Faces Eight Years in Azerbaijan Prison Over Nagorno-Karabakh Visits and Posts 4 days agoKyrgyzstan In Turkey's Neighbour Georgia, a Gülen School Loses its License More » Written byEurasiaNet.org Categories Regions Central Asia & Caucasus Georgia Topics Arts & Culture Technology Share this story: Tweet      Top World Stories Middle East & North Africa Iranians Make ‘Love’ Between Iran and America Go Viral with #LoveBeyondFlags Caribbean Trinidad & Tobago's Carnival 2017 Playlist: Part 1 Eastern & Central Europe The Unofficial Mascot for Russia's Government Censor Is an Erotic Anime Character Argentina Argentina Confronts the Scourge of Women’s Nipples Contributors View all contributors » Menu About Us What is Global Voices?

Also Read : UP Elections: Akhilesh, Rahul release Common Minimum Programme “The Prime Minister is fond of Google searching, peeping into others’ bathrooms. Let him do that in his free time but his main job is that of a Prime Minister in which he has been a cent per cent failure,” Gandhi said while addressing a joint press conference here with Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. Gandhi’s jibe come a day after Modi, while campaigning in the poll bound state, mocked the Congress leader for being the “most joked about politician”. The Prime Minister had earlier attracted the wrath of the Congress over his “bathing wearing a raincoat” barb at his predecessor Manmohan Singh. “The country’s biggest problem is lack of jobs. Modi promised two crore jobs but has not fulfilled even one per cent of his promise. Modi talks a lot about security, terrorism and surgical strikes.” “But the result is we have suffered most number of casualties in the last seven years. Over 90 of our security personnel have been killed,” said Gandhi while referring to the Indian Army’s September 29 surgical strikes on terror launch pads in Pakistan occupied territory. “The Prime Minister is apprehensive of Uttar Pradesh polls result. The result will give him a big shock, will put a question mark on his credibility. That is why he is saying such things,” he added.

X The future of sex for Irish women The internet and advances in technology are enabling Irish women to explore their sexuality, but what does this mean for sexual equality, and what does the future hold? about an hour ago Roe McDermott The internet offers opportunities to meet people to date, to find love or to have one-night-stands, but the platforms don’t teach us anything about romance, love or sex. Fan fiction depicting romances between the likes of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson are a popular form of sexual expression online. Previous Image Next Image         Here is a brief sampling of things that have happened to me while on dates with people I met on dating sites and hook-up apps: One date abandoned me by a canal at 1am because I was on crutches with torn ligaments and thus “walking too slowly”. Another decided he didn’t like the play we were watching and so he left the theatre and me without a word, and did not return. One didn’t make a move, but then set up a fake Instagram account to ask me why nothing had happened. One showed me photos of his ex-wife in a swimsuit, told me he had paid for her breast augmentation and then complained he didn’t get to “benefit” from them. Another drove us into the mountains to a place I didn’t know, then casually mentioned he had a gun in the car. And then there were the silences. The awkward, painful, countless silences of those who did not know what to do with themselves without the winking emoji. This is not the fault of OkCupid or Tinder. It’s ours. All of ours. (Well, those men in particular, but generally ours.) Though technology has advanced and the internet offers us a smorgasbord of mediums through which to meet people to date, to find love or to have one-night-stands, the platforms don’t teach us anything about romance, love or sex. Indeed, society itself didn’t tell us what to do with ourselves or each other after the most major development in sexual technology, contraception, completely altered how we relate to one another. Before contraception was widely available, the act of sex was perceived as a reliable indicator of (if not a direct path to) your place in the social order. Sex was more likely to lead to pregnancy, which meant – if not intimacy and love – at least commitment. The epitome of commitment was marriage, which denoted adulthood, respectability, social success and overall, normalcy. But the course of normalcy never did run smooth, and when sex did not result in commitment or marriage, it was accompanied by judgment and shame – borne mostly by the woman. ADVERTISEMENT But the wide accessibility of contraception today plus increasingly accepting attitudes towards sex, as well as the accessibility of sexually-oriented media and technology, are allowing us to explore sexuality in an entirely new way. However, this technology still exists within a society where sexism, rape culture and sexual shaming still exist, and woman must navigate the dichotomy between technological progress and social realties. Apps such as Tinder have made having casual sex easier and more efficient than ever – though, women’s experiences of so-called “hook-up apps” and approach to casual sex pose a radically different set of concerns than men’s. This gender divide was perfectly summarised in HBO’s 2011 documentary series When Strangers Click: Stories From The Internet. “Surveys show that in the online dating world, women are afraid of meeting a serial killer,” the show cites. “Men are afraid of meeting someone fat.” And as Emily Witt observes in her book Future Sex, “the technology itself promised nothing. It brought us people, but it did not tell us what to do with them.” What’s fascinating about this oft-misaligned relationship between our desire to connect with others online and our reliance on dating apps to do the work for us, is the ways technology can allow us to explore and experience our sexuality when harnessed effectively. And Irish women are leading the way when it comes to creating and utilising alternative online spaces to find some sexual fulfilment and empowerment. Having experienced all the terrible dates above, and understanding the wariness that’s necessary for a woman looking for casual sex, I wasn’t surprised to learn that many women are garnering some of their sexual fulfilment not from real people, but fictional romance or fan fiction. In fan fiction, women take pop culture characters and existing stories and then invent erotic scenes. They engage with the material and also rewrite it to fulfil their fantasies and express their desires. This is not a new phenomenon and these online spaces have enabled women to express their sexuality and fantasies for almost as long as the internet has been accessible to the public. Fanfiction.net, for example, was founded in 1998, and since then other sites have become almost Amazonian in nature; largely populated by women and standing in defiance of male-run publishing worlds and overwhelmingly heteronormative stories. Most fan fiction is written by straight women, yet a huge percentage of queers populate the romantic or sexual pairings, as amateur authors rewrite seemingly heterosexual characters as lovers. This indicates that there’s a demand for gay, lesbian and bisexual narratives which is not being fulfilled by mainstream media, and that online spaces allow women to explore their sexually-fluid desires and fantasies in a way that they do not in their daily lives. Author Sarah Maria Griffin believes that these spaces are empowering. “The women who write fan fiction are charging the canon: they’re building the narratives they want to see, when they don’t see them,” she says. “Because of the severe lack of diverse romantic representation on screen, fan fiction is a permissive tool that allows consumers of these texts to build the representation they want to see in the world, to fulfil something and share it with like-minded readers. “There’s more words of Harry Potter Loves Draco Malfoy fan fiction written than in all of Rowling’s original series – more Sherlock Holmes and John Watson than Conan Doyle ever wrote. There’s such rebellion there: it’s like saying, ‘Here’s the love I want to see in the world, and I’ve conjured it up where the establishment won’t.’” The community aspect of sexual expression is incredibly important online, as people who are into particular fantasies or kinks find each other. This allows for the possibility of having their unique desires fulfilled, but for many the value of being able to connect with like-minded people online is simply having their desires acknowledged, shared and normalised. ADVERTISEMENT Irish people, who have traditionally experienced so much shame around sexuality, can find acceptance and validation at the click of a button. As Witt writes, “Google blurred the distinction between normal and abnormal. The answers its algorithms harvested assured each person of the presence of the like-minded: no one need be alone with aberrant desires, and no desires were aberrant.” And online, no identity is aberrant either. Trans woman Aoife Martin knows all too well how a lack of information and public role models can affect a person’s sense of confidence and self-worth, and how the internet can help fill that void. Working in IT, she has observed and experienced how the internet and technology can educate and empower individuals about sexuality and gender. “I can remember the pre-internet days when there was no information readily available,” says Martin. “Everything I knew about being trans came from reading shock headlines in various red top newspapers. Then the internet came along and it was both a blessing and a curse. Sites like GeoCities (remember that?) allowed people to build their own pages and upload photographs. It was here and on similar sites that I started to gather information about make-up tips, what clothes to wear for my build, how to tuck, how to walk, etc and the scourge of trans people everywhere, how to pass [as a man or woman].” Martin also cites Twitter as being a huge source of inspiration and comfort to her, allowing her to connect with friends and allies who support her. However, she has discovered the dangers and limitations of the internet, too. Many women experience vicious trolling and abuse online, but trans women are at the receiving end of transphobia – bigotry that also makes dating online far more difficult. “There are negative sides to social media, like unwanted attention from trolls,” says Martin, “so you need to keep a level head and step away from the keyboard if necessary. I’ve never used any dating apps or sites. Dating for trans women is fraught with difficulty and danger. I’m a trans lesbian and finding women who are interested in dating a trans woman is, I’m guessing, no easy thing. . . The internet is a wonderful tool, but like all tools it should be used carefully.” Then there are tools that are just meant to be enjoyed (ahem). Times have moved on since British physician Dr Joseph Mortimer Granville invented the electromechanical vibrator, which was used by doctors to “cure” women of “hysteria” by bringing them to orgasm in their local GP’s office. Now, we can do it ourselves with little gadgets that fit into the bedside drawer – and we don’t even have to brave walking into a sex shop if we don’t want to. Shawna Scott, founder of Ireland’s award-winning online sex toy store SexSiopa.ie, says the internet has allowed Irish women to explore their sexuality in a myriad of ways – and sexual technology has had to evolve with the increasing demand for satisfaction. “More than anything,” says Scott, “the internet, through blogs and forums, has allowed women to talk to each other and share ideas about sex and sexuality. We’ve been able to learn about our bodies and about feminism from peers around the world. Because we’ve been sharing that knowledge at a much faster rate than ever before, the sex toy industry in particular has had to make a major shift from being a male-dominated industry that primarily used cheap, dodgy materials, to one where many of the best brands are either founded by women or have women on their design teams.” ADVERTISEMENT However, having women as founders and active participants in sexual media online does not always result in acclaim, awards or even acceptance. In Witt’s book Future Sex, the author explores polyamory, orgasm meditation and webcam sex shows – yet the one sexual medium that truly troubles her is the most popular and accessible: online porn. Witt, who is well-versed in feminist theory and aware of anti-pornography arguments, admits feeling very conflicted about pornography, fearing that enjoying it contributes to the objectification of women. Even when she feels physically aroused by pornography, Witt intellectually prevents herself from enjoying the fantasy, writing that she does “not want to be turned on by sex that was not the kind of sex I wanted to have”. Witt’s inner conflict is emblematic of a burden that women are shouldering when it comes to exploring and experiencing their sexuality in modern times; the need to sexually enjoy the “right” thing. Though many people across all genders experience this worry when it comes to enjoying particular kinks or fetishes, women are disproportionately worried about the morality of their consumption of pornography. Feminist communities are divided on whether one can be a “good feminist” if you enjoy porn, though increasingly many feminist scholars assert that defining pornography as purely oppressive ignores the agency women have as performers and as consumers. Celine Shimizu, a professor of cinema and sexuality studies in San Francisco State University, acted as an editor of The Feminist Porn Book, a book of research by feminist porn scholars as well as feminists within the industry. Shimizu rejects the idea that all pornography is inherently damaging, or that women who consume pornography can be easily labelled as bad feminists. “Pornography is inherently complicated and does not easily fit into good or bad values or conduct,” says Shimizu. “So it is important to talk specifically about why women are watching porn, what they are getting out of it. Many times, it is a matter of sexual curiosity. What feminist porn scholarship challenges in terms of existing frameworks is to define sexuality as not simply oppressive to women but as a creative force women also use and explore.” Porn performer Lorelei Lee uses stronger language to object to how women are policing their own, and each other’s, sexual expression in the name of “good feminism”. A graduate of San Francisco State University and currently applying to law school, Lee points out that arguments surrounding whether porn can be feminist not only predominately target women – but women who are already stigmatised within society. “To be honest, the idea that there is a feminist justification for criminalising the actions of consenting adults and/or for failing to support a labour movement of the most marginalised workers just astonishes and disgusts me,” says Lee. “That this idea is so frequently touted by wealthy white actresses who’ve made their livings performing with their bodies in a profession that only a century ago was vilified in exactly the way sex work is today is just such obvious shortsightedness and respectability politics. ” It’s clear that the internet and technology has had a huge impact on women’s experience of sexuality, and that this relationship will continue to evolve with our understanding of gender, sexuality and feminism. But looking to the future, perhaps the most influential and egalitarian development of sexual technology will involve one of its first and most basic iterations: contraception. Since contraception became fully legalised and widely available in Ireland in 1992, there have been huge advancements in the forms of contraception designed to be used by women, including the pill, IUDs, vaginal rings and contraceptive injections. ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, there has been little or no change or addition to contraceptive options for men (despite reports earlier this week of the success in trials of a male contraceptive, Vasalgel). Women thus not only pay financially for most birth control, but they also pay with their bodies. It is women who endure not only the insertion of most forms of long-term birth control, but who also deal with side effects that alter their moods, hormones, menstrual cycles and weight. Women also must deal with the consequences should these forms of contraception fail; just as women must shoulder the burden when it comes to dating within a rape culture, the political discourse and debates surrounding pornography, and the misogyny that can affect all women who explore and enjoy their sexuality. Advancements in technology may offer us opportunities to explore our sexuality, but it’s our attitudes and commitment to gender equality that will dictate how helpful and empowering they prove to be. Until we become more aware of how sexism and inequality affect our experience of sex, most of the disappointments and dissatisfaction that we have from sexual technology will simply be diagnosed as user error.       Topics: Aoife Martin Celine Shimizu Conan Doyle Emily Witt Harry Potter John Watson Joseph Mortimer Granville Lorelei Lee Sarah Maria Griffin Shawna Scott Sherlock Holmes San Francisco State University Geocities Google Instagram Shimizu Ireland Read More Lessons in love: dating advice from people who’ve made it work Recipe for romance: The perfect Valentine’s meal for two Say 'I do' to a wedding dress from Topshop Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Fashion Say 'I do' to a wedding dress from Topshop Food & Drink Recipe for romance: The perfect Valentine’s meal for two Motors Volkswagen’s new Golf gets in-car technology upgrade Film 2:25 Bad sex in the movies: from Top Gun to Fifty Shades Sponsored Why a flagging libido doesn’t have to be part of your menopause experience Why buying into the Jaguar lifestyle has never been more affordable WebPort Global speeds up exports for Irish SMEs Suites for my sweet: 10 Irish getaways for Valentine’s ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

(File | AP) LUCKNOW: Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday ridiculed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for "peeping into others' bathrooms" and said he was a complete failure at the job. "The Prime Minister is fond of Google searching, peeping into others' bathrooms. Let him do that in his free time but his main job is that of a Prime Minister in which he has been a cent per cent failure," Gandhi said while addressing a joint press conference here with Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.  Gandhi's jibe come a day after Modi, while campaigning in the poll bound state, mocked the Congress leader for being the "most joked about politician".  The Prime Minister had earlier attracted the wrath of the Congress over his "bathing wearing a raincoat" barb at his predecessor Manmohan Singh.  "The country's biggest problem is lack of jobs. Modi promised two crore jobs but has not fulfilled even one per cent of his promise. Modi talks a lot about security, terrorism and surgical strikes." "But the result is we have suffered most number of casualties in the last seven years. Over 90 of our security personnel have been killed," said Gandhi while referring to the Indian Army's September 29 surgical strikes on terror launch pads in Pakistan occupied territory.  "The Prime Minister is apprehensive of Uttar Pradesh polls result. The result will give him a big shock, will put a question mark on his credibility. That is why he is saying such things," he added.  Related Article Akhilesh, Rahul release Common Minimum Programme jointly in Lucknow TAGS Samajwadi Party congress Rahul Gandhi Lucknow Akhilesh Yadav UP polls Common Minimum Programme O P E N Coupon Flipkart Shopclues eBay Latest UP Assembly polls: 45 per cent votes polled till 2 pm Fire breaks out at Tata cancer hospital in Mumbai 17 dead in stampede at Angolan football stadium Four killed as wall collapses in Uttar Pradesh Election official asks Trump for voter fraud evidence 13 dead in flooding in central Indonesia 150 ill after consuming sweets at a religious fair in Pune 13 killed in Bangladesh road accident Gallery In pics: Uttar Pradesh begins voting for next CM Glimpses from the preparations for the biggest aerospace expo in India arrow Videos Battle for Uttar Pradesh begins!

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here LUCKNOW: Taking a swipe at Narendra Modi for his "raincoat in bathroom" barb at Manmohan Singh, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi today said the Prime Minister was more interested in "peeping into bathrooms of people". The Congress Vice President also said that the Prime Minister will get a "jolt" once the results of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections are out. "Modi likes to read janampatri (horoscope), search Google and peep into the bathrooms of people...but he is a failure as a Prime Minister," he said at a joint press conference with Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav where the SP-Congress alliance released a 10-point Common Minimum Programme (CMP). "He (Modi) can do this (peeping into bathrooms) in his free time," Rahul said. His comments come against the backdrop of the Prime Minister's remarks in Parliament that one should learn the art of "bathing with a raincoat on" from Manmohan Singh as there was not a single taint on him despite so many scams having taken place during his regime. Modi had said in an election rally in Haridwar yesterday that BJP had a detailed dossier on the Congress leaders. "Mein Congress ke logon se kehta hoon: jabaan sambhaal kar rakho, warna mere paas aapki poori janampatri padi hui hai (hold your tongue, I have your entire horoscope). Reacting to this comment, Rahul today dared him saying, "You are the Prime Minister for over past two years...You can take out the janmapatri of Congress and go ahead with it." To another comment of Modi that Rahul is the "most joked about person" on Google, the Congress Vice President hit back, saying, "...he likes to search Google and he can do so in his past time...but he has failed in his functions as PM...he will get a jolt from the results of these elections." "(Actually) Modi's policy is that of distraction...when he cannot give answers to issues like employment, security, demonetisation...he indulges in distraction and the whole country knows about it," Rahul said. He said Modi had promised to provide two lakh jobs every year and last year only one lakh youths were provided jobs and this year with the unemployment going high, things are back to square one. "Modi talks about security and terorism...the result of surgical strike has been that some 90 security personnel had to sacrifice their lives first time in seven years," he said. Speaking at the press conference, the UP Chief Minister said emotions and anger were not right as these were elections for growth and prosperity of the state. "Anyone's 'janmpatri' is just a click away in this age of Internet," Akhilesh said, asking the "PM and BJP not to mislead people and come forward and tell them as to what they have given to the state which has elected all prominent NDA leaders". To a question on prominent Muslim clerics like Maulana Ahmed Bukhari and Kalbe Jawwad extending support to BSP, Akhilesh said personal issues should not be manifested at the political level. "One maulana earlier used to seek votes for BJP and is now backing BSP. Is he working towards an alliance between the two parties? As far as the second maulana is concerned you can ask him personally he will give his blessings to the two of us," he said. To a question on whether this alliance will remain intact in the future too, Rahul said, "This is also an alliance of joint vision. We have not come together just for forming a government in UP but also to transform the state." Reality is that the voters understand that the alliance is going to sweep these elections and change Uttar Pradesh, he said. To a question on "lack of coordination" in the alliance, especially on certain seats where both parties are in contest, Rahul said, "On 99 per cent of 403 seats there is no problem and issues are being resolved on the remaining seats...we are fighting elections together...it is wrong to say there is no coordination in alliance." "We want that the government is a set up of youths with a vision...while other parties do not talk about foundation... these 10 points in the joint programme are foundations of development," Rahul stressed. "We also want that the state get a government of all and everyone feels that it is their government...we will help farmers and give jobs to youths," he said. Akhilesh said he was happy with initial voting trend in the first phase of polling. "First votes went to SP-Congress alliance and so the alliance will be ahead," he said. In a dig at BSP chief Mayawati, Akhilesh referred to statues of elephants and stone memorials built in her tenure and said, "Pattharwali sarkar bhi ab development ki baat kar rahi hai...yeh alliance ka impact hai."

PHOTO: AFP NEW YORK: Ford will invest $1 billion over five years in an artificial intelligence startup with the aim of developing an autonomous vehicle by 2021, the auto giant said Friday. Ford will take a majority stake in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company based in Pittsburgh, started in late 2016 by former Google and Uber employees who had worked on autonomous driving. The venture will employ leading engineers and “roboticists” to develop a “virtual driver” system, described by Ford officials as the “brain” of an autonomous vehicle. Autonomoose, other self-driving cars hit Canada streets The setup is intended to give Ford a head start on competitors in the race to commercialize autonomous vehicles, said Ford executive vice president Raj Nair. “This is really unique in the industry,” Nair said on a conference call with analysts. It will have the “speed and nimbleness of a startup, but also integrated into a full production development team.” Nair said research towards full autonomy has moved “beyond the research phase,” but there remains the need for a “tremendous leap” between the driver-assist technologies now available and full autonomy. Argo AI employees will have a minority equity stake in the venture. The structure is intended to lure top engineers to the venture, Ford executives said. NAVYA Self-driving shuttle goes to work in Las Vegas Ford said the investment would help it to realize a previously announced plan to introduce an autonomous vehicle for ride-hailing or ride-sharing service in 2021. Argo AI plans to hire more than 200 people at sites in Pittsburgh, Michigan and Silicon Valley, according to a press release. Argo AI and other boosters of autonomous driving argue it could make roads safer and open up mobility to the elderly and others. “We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move,” Argo AI chief Bryan Salesky said.

The judge said Microsoft has at least made a plausible argument that federal law muzzles its right to speak about government investigations, while not ruling on the merits of the case. "The public debate has intensified as people increasingly store their information in the cloud and on devices with significant storage capacity,” U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle said in Thursday’s ruling. “Government surveillance aided by service providers creates unique considerations because of the vast amount of data service providers have about their customers." Robart rejected the tech giant’s argument that the so-called sneak-and-peek searches amount to an unlawful search and seizure of property. Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch had argued that federal law allows the Justice Department to obtain electronic communications without disclosure of a specific warrant if it would endanger an individual or an investigation. Robart, a 2004 appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, has already riled President Donald Trump this month by halting a temporary ban on visitors, immigrants and refugees from seven mostly Muslim countries. Trump labeled Robart a “so-called judge” and called his ruling in that case “ridiculous.” Escalating Feud Microsoft sued the government in April, escalating a feud with the U.S. over customer privacy and the company’s ability to disclose what it’s asked to turn over to investigators. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft drew support in the case from tech leaders including Apple Inc., Google and Amazon.com Inc., which argued the very future of mobile and cloud computing is at stake if customers can’t trust that their data will remain private. They said the federal law allowing the searches goes “far beyond any necessary limits” and infringes users’ fundamental rights. “We’re pleased this ruling enables our case to move forward toward a reasonable solution that works for law enforcement and ensures secrecy is used only when necessary,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s chief legal officer, said in a statement. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the ruling while the department reviews it.

Fourth Amendment In the portion of Thursday’s ruling that sided with the government, the judge said he could not reconcile the company’s attempt to assert the Fourth Amendment protection against invasive searches on behalf of its customers with earlier court decisions. Other courts have found that such rights can only be asserted by individuals, and not vicariously by third parties, he said. Still, Robart recognized that the law used by the government to block Microsoft from informing users about searches “means customers whose accounts have been accessed by the government may never know of the search.” Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Secrecy orders on government warrants for access to private e-mail accounts generally prohibit Microsoft from telling customers about the requests for lengthy or even unlimited periods, the company said when it sued. At the time, federal courts had issued almost 2,600 secrecy orders to Microsoft alone, and more than two-thirds had no fixed end date. In those cases, the company can never tell customers about government searches, even after an investigation is completed. The industry’s push against government intrusion into their customers’ private information began in the wake of Edward Snowden’s 2013 disclosures about covert-data collection that put internet companies on the defensive. Microsoft concedes that there may be times when the government is justified in seeking a gag order to prevent customers under investigation from tampering with evidence or harming another person. Still, the company contends the statute authorizing the gag orders is too broad and sets too low of a standard for secrecy. The case is Microsoft Corp. v. U.S. Department of Justice, 16-cv-00538, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle). Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Auckland woman Golnaz Bassam Tabar says she was 'butchered' in beauty treatment 12:38 PM Saturday Feb 11, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Accidents Auckland Central Auckland Council Auckland Region Beauty Health New Zealand Ponsonby Golnaz Bassam Tabar, who alleges she suffered burns to her face after receiving a beauty treatment. Photo / Chris Loufte A woman is planning legal action against a central Auckland beauty salon whose treatment she says burned her, leaving her face "butchered" and her looking "like a burns victim". Golnaz Bassam Tabar is one of several unhappy customers to leave a recent scathing review on iCandy's Facebook page, with others complaining of burns and bleeding fingers. Tabar paid $25 for a face wax on Friday afternoon at the Ponsonby Rd salon. The iCandy store in Ponsonby. Photo / Supplied Hours later, she claims tiny spots appeared under her right eye but at first the Auckland publicist wasn't too concerned. That changed when she saw her face in the bathroom mirror while on night shift. "I thought 'woah that's not what it's supposed to look like'," she told the Herald. "It's butchered, its so bad I'm horrified. It looks like I've been in a freak accident." Four areas of Tabar's face now sport large brown welts and she says they've continued to get worse over the past day. "There's no way you should look like this when you go to professionals," she said. "I think I'm going to take legal action against them." Continued below.

"At first I wasn't so angry but now I'm furious. I'm looking at it ... it's a butcher job," Tabar said. "It's so sore. It's completely raw. I can't be out in the sun. It's just red, I look like a burns victim." Golnaz Bassam Tabar shows her injuries. Photo / Supplied A spokeswoman for the salon showed the Herald an online bank transaction, saying she had deposited a refund into Tabar's bank account. "Just let me run my business and look after my children," she said. "Go on Google, accidents happen everywhere." The woman, who did not give her name, said she waxed up to 15 clients a day and "they are all good". She said she had no further comment. Store management posted on Facebook this afternoon that they had offered Tabar a refund. Tabar had agreed the offer and said she would take down her posts about her treatment once the money had been paid. Tabar with the burns on her face. Photo / Chris Loufte The company also stated they would stop offering the facial wax service. Tabar would be visiting a doctor next week and was upset at having to pay for medical appointments and after care following what was supposed to be a cheap procedure. "I didn't think a place in Ponsonby would do such a bad job," she said. "The only reason I thought I could go somewhere so cheap was because of the location." iCandy's Facebook page is riddled with negative reviews and another woman, who asked the Herald to only refer to her by her first name, said she'd been burned during a face wax as well. Helen got the procedure done six weeks ago and says she had to cover her face for a week after to hide the burn on her cheekbone. "It was awful, absolutely awful," she said. "It was just underneath my eye and it blistered, it was there for over a week. I couldn't go to work the next day because it looked disgusting." Helen managed to get a refund but only after threatening to lay a complaint against the company. She claimed the owner had not apologised and was difficult to deal with, a sentiment echoed by customer Taina Kearns, whose sisters fingers were left bleeding after a manicure last November. Kearns said the pair demanded a refund and wouldn't leave the shop until they were given one, causing iCandy's owner to threaten to call the police. Tabar before the alleged injury. Photo / Supplied Investigation of company on Monday Auckland Council was not immediately able to check whether they had received complaints about the company but said they would be investigating the premises on Monday "to see if the salon is in breach of the health and hygiene bylaw". A council spokeswoman said concerns about burns and other injuries should be referred to WorkSafe NZ. WorkSafe NZ said they were unable to check whether any complaints had been made outside of normal business hours. President of the New Zealand Beauty Therapist's Association, Kim Ryan said she would have expected that someone who suffered burns as serious as Tabar's would have felt it the minute the wax was applied to her face. Ryan said there are no Government regulations controlling the beauty industry in New Zealand making incidents as such "more common than they should be". "Especially by people who aren't qualified beauty therapists. Ninety per cent of waxing problems are caused by people who aren't beauty therapists," said Ryan who alluded to the likes of hairdressers or nail salons that offer the service. The association handles complaints made about its voluntarily registered members as well as unregistered companies. "We will contact them and suggest they get further training or offer to train them. If our members don't take notice we can expel them from the association," Ryan said. According to Ryan, many companies do not go through a consultation process with their clients before treatments like a wax and therefore fail to discern vital information about their skin and any skin medication that could affect the procedure. - NZ Herald Read more by Tess Nichol Email Tess Nichol Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Inside the ethical brothel: Selling sex out of the shadows More than a decade since controversial law reform, a brothel owner says her modern establishment… Hawke's Bay Today Frustrated cricket fans left in dark during Napier ODI Cricket fans were left bored, frustrated and angry as what was supposed to be an exciting… Bay of Plenty Times Two house fires break out in North Island Two serious house fires have broken out in the North Island.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas February 11, 2017 04:45 GMT Close Four top tips for avoiding fake news IBTimes UK Apple chief executive is calling on governments and technology firms to step up in the battle against fake news and misinformation online, dubbing it "one of today's chief problems." In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Cook urged governments to launch a public information campaign to curb the spread of false news stories, hoaxes and misinformation that are "killing people's minds, in a way." "It has to be ingrained in the schools, it has to be ingrained in the public," Cook told the British publication. "There has to be a massive campaign. We have to think through every demographic. We need a modern version of a public service announcement campaign. It can be done quickly if there is a will. "We are going through this period of time right here where unfortunately some of the people that are winning are the people that spend their time trying to get the most clicks, not tell the most truth." Social media companies, news aggregators and other technology firms including Facebook and Google have drawn criticism over fake news and not doing enough to curb its dissemination, particularly during the recent US presidential election campaign season. Some critics believe the rampant spread of fake news and conspiracy theories online may have helped Donald Trump win the presidency. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg initially dismissed the claims as a "pretty crazy idea," but vowed to address the problem. The social media giant has rolled out a series of measures to weed out fake news from the platform such as making it easier for users to flag suspect articles and working with third-party fact checkers. According to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center, nearly a quarter of Americans polled admitted they have shared a fake news story, either knowingly or later finding it was false. About two in three US adults said faux news stories has sowed a great deal of confusion over basic facts of current events and issues. While 45% of US adults polled said government, politicians and elected officials bear significant responsibility for preventing fake stories from garnering attention, 43% said the responsibility falls on the public and another 42% said it falls on social networking sites and search engines. "All of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news," Cook said. "We must try to squeeze this without stepping on freedom of speech and of the press, but we must also help the reader. Too many of us are just in the complaint category right now and haven't figure out what to do." Tim Cook is calling on governments and tech firms to help tackle the spread of fake news and misinformation.Bernd Thissen/AFP/Getty Images Cook said that the crackdown on fake news stories would also mean that "truthful, reliable, non-sensational, deep news outlets will win." "The [rise of fake news] is a short-term thing, I don't believe that people want that at the end of the day," he noted. He added that educating kids in school about the fake news phenomenon and the dangers associated with it could also help address the issue as well. Cook said, "It's almost as if a new course is required for the modern kid, for the digital kid," Cook said. "In some ways kids will be the easiest to educate. At least before a certain age, they are very much in listen and understand [mode], and they they push their parents to act. We saw this with environmental issues: kids learning at school and coming home and saying why do you have this plastic bottle? Why are you throwing it away?"

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Ford Motor is spending $1 billion to take over a robotics startup to acquire more of the expertise needed to reach its ambitious goal of having a fully driverless vehicle on the road by 2021. The big bet announced Friday comes just a few months after the Pittsburgh startup, Argo AI, was created by two alumni of Carnegie Mellon University's robotics program, Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander. Salesky formerly worked on self-driving cars at a high-profile project within Google — now known as Waymo — and Rander did the same kind of engineering at ride-hailing service Uber before the two men teamed up to launch Argo late last year. Argo had been considering whether to raise money from venture capitalists, the conventional fundraising channel for startups, before opting to become an independent subsidiary of Ford instead. Ford is spreading its $1 billion investment over a five-year period. The alliance between Argo and Ford aims to combine the spunk and dexterity of a technologically savvy startup with the financial muscle and manufacturing know-how of a major automaker. The unusual deal marks the next step in Ford's journey toward building a vehicle without a steering wheel or brake pad by 2021 — a vision that CEO Mark Fields laid out last summer. The decision to turn to Argo for help is a tacit acknowledgement that Ford wouldn't be able to pull it off on its own. "This is likely a realization that Ford is behind relative to companies like GM, Audi, Volvo, Waymo and Uber, and is trying to catch up," said Raj Rajkumar, a Carnegie Mellon computer engineering professor who leads the school's autonomous vehicle research. Ford is counting on Salesky and Rander to hire about 200 employees during the next year while working on the core technology of its autonomous vehicle — the "virtual driver" system. That will serve as car's "brains, eyes, ears and senses," said Raj Nair, Ford's chief technical officer who also leads the company's product development. Competitors such as NVIDIA have developed artificial intelligence that learns about different situations as it's tested on roads, something that is almost essential for an autonomous car to function in heavy traffic on city streets. In return for its funding, Argo will design its driverless system exclusively for Ford and then have a chance to license the technology to other automakers in the future. If Argo's system turns out to be far ahead of anything else on the market, the subsidiary could eventually be worth substantially more than it is now. Argo employees, who will work from offices in Pittsburgh, Michigan and the Silicon Valley, will be given stock in the subsidiary as part of their compensation packages so they will be enriched if their Argo's technology becomes a hot commodity. Ford isn't the first company to spend huge sums to obtain more experience and skills in robotics. Uber bought autonomous trucking startup Otto for an estimated $680 million last summer primarily to get Otto's engineers on its team working on driverless vehicles. Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski, another former Google engineer, is now overseeing Uber's testing of driverless cars in Pittsburgh and Arizona. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Regarding the name: connected "communities" is apt because we're taking an initiative NOT ONLY to connect and form a network of spaces that support open source activities But also, to connect the communities that these spaces foster.

Others, like the emotional one I’ve been on from the rise and subsequent fall of modular smartphone design, are not. For a while, I truly thought that modular smartphones would eventually be the future of smartphones. The seed was planted from the Phonebloks Kickstarter in 2013 and grew once I learned that Google took on its own modular project in the form of Project Ara, inspired by Phonebloks. Once it was announced that Project Ara was canceled, my enthusiasm for the concept scaled back, especially after seeing other smartphones with modular concepts fall short in big areas. Fairphone, for example, was the first commercially available modular smartphone. Like many companies who have their sights set on modularity, Fairphone’s main concern appears to be making their phone as eco-friendly as possible by allowing users to easily swap out parts instead of replacing the entire phone, cutting back on e-Waste over time. The concept is admirable, but Fairphone isn’t without its issues. Despite its mid-range specs, the phone is pretty expensive at just over $560. The biggest issue for me is believing that updated modules will be made for years to come, which isn’t to fault Fairphone specifically – it’s just that modularity’s endeavors have proven fruitless thus far. Even big companies like LG have had problems getting the concept to take off. The LG G5 was unveiled last year during MWC, a time when I was still starry-eyed about modularity. I still consider it a brave move by LG, but clearly not a move they were willing to dedicate to. Despite making it seem as if the phone would eventually support a robust line of modules, ultimately the two modules introduced alongside the G5 were the only two to make it, making the G5's modular concept underwhelming, to say the least. And then there’s the Moto Z. Admittedly, I didn’t have much hope for the Moto Z for a while. It wasn’t until recently that I started to take it seriously, but only because Lenovo continues to champion the cause. The company continues to take initiative regarding the development of Moto Mods from third parties, and the support they’re receiving look encouraging. According to the latest Moto Blog, there are some pretty cool new mods in the pipeline for the Moto Z, like the Edge mod that brings flashy RGB notification lighting as well as either a 2,000 mAh battery or wireless charging capabilities. The Edge is just one of several finalists in Lenovo/Motorola's “Transform the Smartphone Challenge”, which Motorola states received more than 700 submissions since the challenge began. If nothing else, we at least know there’s a serious interest in Moto Mod development, which gives me faith that Moto Z won’t just be another fluke from 2016.   I try to remain grounded these days about modularity. I may have been a little overzealous about certain concepts at the beginning, but when you consider just how far smartphone technology has come in so little time, not much seems like it's beyond the realm of possibilities. Perhaps someday we might still see a concept as complex as Phonebloks or Project Ara, but until then I’ll be keeping an eye on what changes come to the Moto Z in 2017. If Lenovo stays true to their word and Moto Mods are usable from one Moto Z generation to the next, then I think the Moto Z just might remain a beacon of hope and a significant stepping stone for modularity.

You can find the rest by clicking here. "Out of the frying pan and into the fire" should be the unofficial mantra of Ghost Town Game's recent hit, Overcooked; a local-multiplayer cooking game that's charming and chaotic in equal measure.  Deceptively simple, Overcooked lures played in by asking them to work as a team to serve up a range of delectable dishes in a restaurant overflowing with hungry customers. How hard could it possibly be? There's four of you, after all.  Well, unless you're a team player, the answer is "improbably, painstakingly difficult." That's because Overcooked designers Phil Duncan and Oli De-Vine wanted to create a game that placed co-operation at its core, forcing players to work together and communicate to succeed in the cut-throat world of catering. It's a design philosophy hat earned the Ghost Town team two nominations at this year's Independent Game Festival, with Overcooked receiving nods for the Excellence in Design Award and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize.  So, to learn more about how the studio created such a pure co-op experience, Gamasutra caught up with Duncan to dig deep into Overcooked's design and game dev processes.  What's your background in making games? Oli (De-Vine) and I both worked together at Frontier Developments before starting Ghost Town Games (Oli was a coder and I was a designer there) We worked there for about eight years and we'd been making prototypes together for the last three to four years. We'd both been involved in various aspects of games development before then, but it was at Frontier that we started to get a feel for the type of games we wanted to create. How did you come up with the concept? We knew we wanted to make a co-operative game from the start, we used to meet up at lunch time with a group of friends and play multiplayer games together and we always felt the type of co-operative experience we wanted was in really short supply. Cooking just seemed like the perfect analogy for the experience we wanted. Having worked in various kitchen I knew first hand that it involved lots of teamwork, there was a lot of vocal communication and that when time was against you it would invariably end in lots and lots of shouting. What development tools were used to build your game? We built the game in Unity, it was an engine we were both familiar with and had used for projects in the past. It matched the project really well too as it allowed us to really quickly implement new ideas and features to see how well they worked with players. On top of that we also used, Maya, Photoshop, Google docs and Just Eat. How much time did you spend working on the game? Overall we worked on the game full time for about 18 months, starting in March 2015 right up until the release in August 2016 What drove you to make a co-operative, local multiplayer title? Were there any other games in particular that inspired you?  I've always been a fan of co-operative games and co-operative experiences in general. I really like sharing a challenge with my friends, that feeling that your combined experience and your ability to work well as a team means you can accomplish more than you could if you were on your own. I think we wanted to capture that with the game, rather than just make a game where one player could carry the rest of the team, with Overcooked all players are equally responsible for the success of the team. I'm sure there are lots of different games which inspired us along the way, games like Space Team, an Xbox Indie game called Storage Inc, Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, there's even bits of Mario Kart and The Last of Us that were brought up as reference at various points during development.    From a design point of view, what steps did you take to ensure Overcooked's competitive and co-operative aspects struck the perfect balance? How did you know when you'd hit on the right formula? It was a real balancing act, we were constantly adjusting the ratio of freedom and restriction that we gave the players. At one point you could put as many ingredients as you wanted into a pan or into a burger, there were just so many different ways that the players could make a mistake on an order that we ended up having to add restrictions to stop players feeling frustrated. At the same time if you restricted the players too much they wouldn't feel as attached to the experience so we needed to be sure we didn't go too far. We spent a lot of time making adjustments to this basic flow, putting the game in front of players, judging their reaction and then making more adjustments. I think we knew we'd hit a sweet spot when our friends still wanted to play the game without us having to bribe them with pizza. How did that desire to create a co-operative experience impact your approach to level design? Were you refining gameplay and working on levels simultaneously, or did one come before the other? At least initially we spent a lot of time working on both simultaneously. Occasionally we would add a mechanic, or introduce a change that would require a level to be completely redesigned or in some cases scrapped entirely. When designing levels we would generally work backwards: consider what experience we wanted to give the player and then shape the level to try and give them that. One of the most difficult aspects was balancing the scoring for our levels. We have different scores boundaries for 1,2,3 and 4 players for all our 30+ levels. Which meant if you made a simple change to the game (change the movement speed or the chopping speed) suddenly all the scores in the game would need to be adjusted... that happened quite a few times in the last few weeks of development. Have you played any of the other IGF finalists? Any games you've particularly enjoyed? The list of finalists this year reads as a who's who of games I really want to play but haven't had the time. We haven't really stopped working on the game since the release last August, but we've had a bit more time this year to catch up on various titles we'd missed. Games like Inside and Hyper Light Drifter were really impressive, but honestly there's just so many games on the list that I know I'll love and I can't wait to play. What do you think are the biggest hurdles (and opportunities) for indie devs today? It's a constantly changing landscape so it's hard to say exactly what the biggest hurdles are on any given day. It's true there are a lot more independent games being produced these days but as a result of that there are more sub genres of games emerging and more players being introduced to games than ever before. In terms of opportunities, the good news is that a lot of individuals and organizations are out there to help independent developers who are struggling with particular aspects of the game development process, be that, funding, marketing, PR etc. Related Jobs Versus Evil — San Diego, California, United States [02.10.17] QA Standup Leader Sperasoft — KrakÃ³w, Poland [02.10.17] Quest // Mission Designer Telltale Games — San Rafael, California, United States [02.09.17] Mobile Producer Relic Entertainment — Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada [02.09.17] Executive Producer [View All Jobs] Top Stories Valve to replace Steam Greenlight with a fee-based game submission system Layoffs hit Activision-owned Infinity Ward, Beenox, and others Devs react to Valve's planned fee-based Steam submission system Blog: Design and monetization analysis of Fire Emblem Heroes [Next News Story]    [View All] 290885 newswire /view/news/290885/Road_to_the_IGF_Ghost_Town_Games_Overcooked.php Loading Comments TECHNOLOGY GROUP Black Hat Content Marketing Institute Content Marketing World Dark Reading Enterprise Connect Fusion GDC Gamasutra HDI ICMI InformationWeek Interop ITX Network Computing No Jitter VRDC COMMUNITIES SERVED Content Marketing Enterprise IT Enterprise Communications Game Development Information Security IT Services & Support WORKING WITH US Advertising Contacts Event Calendar Tech Marketing Solutions Contact Us Licensing Terms of Service Privacy Statement Copyright © 2017 UBM, All rights reserved

Quotes in the article Ford Motor Co F ▲ 12.51 +0.13 +1.05% General Motors Co GM ▲ 35.17 +0.09 +0.26% The investment in Pittsburg-based Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber, will make Ford the company's largest shareholder. Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said the investment is in line with previous announcements on planned capital expenditures. Argo AI, which focuses on artificial intelligence and robotics, will help build what Ford calls its "virtual driver system" at the heart of the fully autonomous car Ford said last year it would develop by 2021. "With Argo AI’s agility and Ford's scale we're combining the benefits of a technology start up with the experience and discipline we have at Ford," Fields said at a press conference. Once the technology is fully developed for Ford, it could be licensed to other companies, executives said. While Ford will retain a majority of the start-up's equity, the potential for an equity stake as Argo AI hires 200 more employees will be an advantage in recruiting talent, executives said. "They have the opportunity to run it pretty independently with a board, but because it is a separate company or subsidiary, it has the opportunity to go out and recruit with competitive compensation packages and equity," Fields said.© REUTERS/Daniel Becerril Ford logo is pictured at a car dealership in Monterrey Until now, Ford's investments in future transportation technology have been relatively modest, compared with those of General Motors Co and others. One of Ford’s largest such investments in the past year was $75 million to buy a minority stake in Velodyne, a manufacturer of laser-based lidar sensing systems for self-driving cars. Rival GM made a billion-dollar bet a year ago with its acquisition of Silicon Valley self-driving startup Cruise Automation. GM also invested $500 million to buy a 9-percent stake in San Francisco-based ride services firm Lyft, a competitor to Uber.

Puskar, File) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Ford Motor is spending $1 billion to take over a robotics startup to acquire more of the expertise needed to reach its ambitious goal of having a fully driverless vehicle on the road by 2021. The big bet announced Friday comes just a few months after the Pittsburgh startup, Argo AI, was created by two alumni of Carnegie Mellon University's robotics program, Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander. Salesky formerly worked on self-driving cars at a high-profile project within Google — now known as Waymo — and Rander did the same kind of engineering at ride-hailing service Uber before the two men teamed up to launch Argo late last year. Argo had been considering whether to raise money from venture capitalists, the conventional fundraising channel for startups, before opting to become an independent subsidiary of Ford instead. Ford is spreading its $1 billion investment over a five-year period. The alliance between Argo and Ford aims to combine the spunk and dexterity of a technologically savvy startup with the financial muscle and manufacturing know-how of a major automaker. The unusual deal marks the next step in Ford's journey toward building a vehicle without a steering wheel or brake pad by 2021 — a vision that CEO Mark Fields laid out last summer. The decision to turn to Argo for help is a tacit acknowledgement that Ford wouldn't be able to pull it off on its own. "This is likely a realization that Ford is behind relative to companies like GM, Audi, Volvo, Waymo and Uber, and is trying to catch up," said Raj Rajkumar, a Carnegie Mellon computer engineering professor who leads the school's autonomous vehicle research. Ford is counting on Salesky and Rander to hire about 200 employees during the next year while working on the core technology of its autonomous vehicle — the "virtual driver" system. That will serve as car's "brains, eyes, ears and senses," said Raj Nair, Ford's chief technical officer who also leads the company's product development.

Competitors such as NVIDIA have developed artificial intelligence that learns about different situations as it's tested on roads, something that is almost essential for an autonomous car to function in heavy traffic on city streets. In return for its funding, Argo will design its driverless system exclusively for Ford and then have a chance to license the technology to other automakers in the future. If Argo's system turns out to be far ahead of anything else on the market, the subsidiary could eventually be worth substantially more than it is now. Argo employees, who will work from offices in Pittsburgh, Michigan and the Silicon Valley, will be given stock in the subsidiary as part of their compensation packages so they will be enriched if their Argo's technology becomes a hot commodity. Ford isn't the first company to spend huge sums to obtain more experience and skills in robotics. Uber bought autonomous trucking startup Otto for an estimated $680 million last summer primarily to get Otto's engineers on its team working on driverless vehicles. Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski, another former Google engineer, is now overseeing Uber's testing of driverless cars in Pittsburgh and Arizona. ___ AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this story.

WIRE Ford Invests $1 Billion in Robotics Startup Argo to Help Bring a Driverless Car to Market by 2021 The Pittsburgh startup, founded by two alumni of Carnegie Mellon University's robotics program, is only a few months old. Michael Liedtke, Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Ford Motor is spending $1 billion to take over a robotics startup to acquire more of the expertise needed to reach its ambitious goal of having a fully driverless vehicle on the road by 2021. The big bet announced Friday comes just a few months after the Pittsburgh startup, Argo AI, was created by two alumni of Carnegie Mellon University's robotics program, Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander. Salesky formerly worked on self-driving cars at a high-profile project within Google -- now known as Waymo -- and Rander did the same kind of engineering at ride-hailing service Uber before the two men teamed up to launch Argo late last year. Argo had been considering whether to raise money from venture capitalists, the conventional fundraising channel for startups, before opting to become an independent subsidiary of Ford instead. Ford is spreading its $1 billion investment over a five-year period. The alliance between Argo and Ford aims to combine the spunk and dexterity of a technologically savvy startup with the financial muscle and manufacturing know-how of a major automaker. The unusual deal marks the next step in Ford's journey toward building a vehicle without a steering wheel or brake pad by 2021 -- a vision that CEO Mark Fields laid out last summer. The decision to turn to Argo for help is a tacit acknowledgement that Ford wouldn't be able to pull it off on its own. "This is likely a realization that Ford is behind relative to companies like GM, Audi, Volvo, Waymo and Uber, and is trying to catch up," said Raj Rajkumar, a Carnegie Mellon computer engineering professor who leads the school's autonomous vehicle research. Ford is counting on Salesky and Rander to hire about 200 employees during the next year while working on the core technology of its autonomous vehicle -- the "virtual driver" system. That will serve as car's "brains, eyes, ears and senses," said Raj Nair, Ford's chief technical officer who also leads the company's product development. Competitors such as NVIDIA have developed artificial intelligence that learns about different situations as it's tested on roads, something that is almost essential for an autonomous car to function in heavy traffic on city streets. In return for its funding, Argo will design its driverless system exclusively for Ford and then have a chance to license the technology to other automakers in the future. If Argo's system turns out to be far ahead of anything else on the market, the subsidiary could eventually be worth substantially more than it is now. Argo employees, who will work from offices in Pittsburgh, Michigan and the Silicon Valley, will be given stock in the subsidiary as part of their compensation packages so they will be enriched if their Argo's technology becomes a hot commodity. Ford isn't the first company to spend huge sums to obtain more experience and skills in robotics. Uber bought autonomous trucking startup Otto for an estimated $680 million last summer primarily to get Otto's engineers on its team working on driverless vehicles. Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski, another former Google engineer, is now overseeing Uber's testing of driverless cars in Pittsburgh and Arizona. ___ AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this story.

The investment in Pittsburg-based Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber, will make Ford the company's largest shareholder. Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said the investment is in line with previous announcements on planned capital expenditures. Argo AI, which focuses on artificial intelligence and robotics, will help build what Ford calls its "virtual driver system" at the heart of the fully autonomous car Ford said last year it would develop by 2021. "With Argo AI’s agility and Ford's scale we're combining the benefits of a technology start up with the experience and discipline we have at Ford," Fields said at a press conference. Once the technology is fully developed for Ford, it could be licensed to other companies, executives said. While Ford will retain a majority of the start-up's equity, the potential for an equity stake as Argo AI hires 200 more employees will be an advantage in recruiting talent, executives said. "They have the opportunity to run it pretty independently with a board, but because it is a separate company or subsidiary, it has the opportunity to go out and recruit with competitive compensation packages and equity," Fields said. Until now, Ford's investments in future transportation technology have been relatively modest, compared with those of General Motors Co and others. One of Ford’s largest such investments in the past year was $75 million to buy a minority stake in Velodyne, a manufacturer of laser-based lidar sensing systems for self-driving cars. Rival GM made a billion-dollar bet a year ago with its acquisition of Silicon Valley self-driving startup Cruise Automation. GM also invested $500 million to buy a 9-percent stake in San Francisco-based ride services firm Lyft, a competitor to Uber.

Thomas Magee for Engadget save Save share Inauguration-protest arrests lead to Facebook data prosecution Move fast and break democracy. Violet Blue, @violetblue 12h ago in Security 950 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Illustration by D. Thomas Magee for Engadget If you attend a protest in Washington, D.C., nowadays, better plan on leaving your cellphone at home. That is, unless you want police to confiscate it, mine it for incriminating information and then gather even more data from their BFF -- Facebook. At least one person arrested during protests on Inauguration Day got an email from Facebook's Law Enforcement Response Team alerting them that investigators wanted access to their data. Another received a Facebook data subpoena. The email was basically a countdown to when Facebook inevitably handed that data over to D.C. police. That is, unless the respondent figured out how to file an objection within a 10-day window. When over 230 people were arrested in D.C. during protests against Donald Trump last month, many of those rounded up were not part of the protests. Cops swept up medics, legal observers, and six journalists from Voactiv, RT America and others. All of their phones were confiscated and retained. Everyone arrested now faces felony charges and up to 10 years in prison. In the Bay Area, where we love a good protest, it's very rare that arrested protesters get prosecuted. So it's odd to think that protesters would have their social media scrutinized after an arrest. Though, like in most cities across America, it's extremely common for investigators to search the social media of suspects in other crimes if they believe that the suspect posted something related (like photos of a beating). SFPD even has an officer devoted to following social media -- most heavily, Snapchat and Instagram, as those are apparently where you find the best crime stuff. Oakland Police and supporting agencies like California Highway Patrol have been very transparent about monitoring Twitter to determine protest movement and plans. And we've been pretty vocal about pushing back. It only makes sense that we'd resist any form of surveillance, seeing that we're ground zero around here for ethically challenged startups that invade our privacy. Fighting the surveillance state has become part of our DNA. But a wide-ranging Facebook subpoena for felony protest prosecution isn't something we've seen the likes of. The subpoena issued to Facebook (this one by the U.S. Attorney's Office on January 27, 2017 and signed off on by a D.C. Metropolitan Police Detective) obtained by press this week is chilling. It targeted another inauguration arrestee, and requests subscriber information from Facebook that includes all names, all addresses (home, business, emails), phone records, session details (IP, ports, etc), device identification info, payment information, and more. CityLab explained, "The redacted blocks on the second page shield columns of phone numbers, which are connected to other arrestees for whom the district attorney and police are seeking information." The list of phone numbers may indicate that police have gained access to someone's phone and are building a case with what they found. A screenshot provided to CityLab indicates police began mining information from the confiscated devices right after the arrests. On one hand, that could've been automated pinging by Gmail to Google's servers. Or, it could've been something darker. When phones are taken as evidence, they're supposed to be secured in a signal-blocking Faraday bag to prevent remote wipes. Fred Jennings, a cybercrime defense attorney at the firm Tor Ekeland in New York, told press: "If it had been secured properly and placed in the bag to safeguard it, there'd be no way for it to ping the server." For some of us, this sets off a different set of alarms. It's scary enough that police are arresting journalists and mining our phones for all the terrifyingly detailed data Facebook seems all too happy to give up. But authorities with questionable intent are also collecting our contacts, and pose a very real risk for our protected sources. Some of this could be solved by ditching our devices in favor of carrying on-the-scene burner phones. But this presents a new host of complications and problems, even for the well-intentioned protester or march participant. For one, it's a hassle for most people. It also defeats the purpose of using your Twitter or Facebook account. More than ever, it's vital that our voices are heard through media we share from our phones. Things like immigration-ban protests and the state-level denial of chaos at the airports can't be dismissed when the realities are documented through our established Facebook and Twitter accounts. Keeping a record of what authorities do to us, and being able to send a signal flare for help to our networks, makes them being used against us a much bigger problem than just saying "leave your phone at home" or "don't talk about the protest online." It's not a stretch to lay blame at Facebook's feet for taking data we don't necessarily want to give it, and for its well-established collaboration with police against its users. It's a bigger stretch to suggest that the agreement between Facebook and its users is any kind of informed consent. It's interesting that this news comes up the same week that 333,000 people signed a petition demanding Facebook improve its corporate citizenship, with 1,500 of the signees being company shareholders. That document led to a proposal to remove Mark Zuckerberg from the board. This, it said, was necessary at a time when Facebook "faces increasing criticism regarding its perceived role in the promotion of misleading news; censorship, hate speech and alleged inconsistencies in the application of Facebook's community-standards guidelines and content policies; targeting of ad views based on race; collaboration with law enforcement and other government agencies; and calls for public accountability regarding the human-rights impacts of Facebook's practices." It's that collaboration with law enforcement and human-rights accountability we'll be hearing more about as the D.C. arrest cases unfold. It's not a new story, just an old one with a twist: Facebook got called out just before the US presidential election for colluding with authorities against its users' human rights, specifically US police departments. A coalition of 70 human-rights groups, including the ACLU, wrote a public letter to Facebook condemning the company's zeal in doing police bidding around the world. Facebook, of course, just wants us to live our lives so it can keep collecting data we don't even know we're creating. Recording and storing our location, connections, contacts, experiences, our secrets and our history. It's transforming our memories into a malevolent, atavistic shadow that someday may be used against us in a court of law.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Levin Report Elizabeth Warren Politely Asks Goldman Sachs to Confess Its Crimes Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Levin Report Elizabeth Warren Politely Asks Goldman Sachs to Confess Its Crimes Is Lloyd Blankfein the architect of a nefarious plan to manipulate the president? The Massachusetts senator is just asking questions. by Bess LevinFebruary 10, 2017 5:26 pm Email Facebook Twitter She’s on to you, buddy boy. Left, by Alex Wong, right, by Drew Angerer, both from Getty Images. Among the many people whom Donald Trump has hired from Goldman Sachs, his highest-profile score was bank president Gary Cohn, who accepted the role of National Economic Council director in December. After laying low at first, Cohn reportedly began flexing his muscles within the White House, working to sideline Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro and other protectionist provocateurs. (To what extent Cohn’s more establishment-friendly view of macroeconomics wins out over the revanchists remains to be seen.) Last week, he began making the rounds to promote his new boss’s big push to weaken Wall Street regulations, including an executive order designed to gut Dodd-Frank and another that would dismantle a fiduciary rule protecting investors from being fleeced by their brokers. On the matter of the fiduciary rule, Cohn argued that consumers are adults and therefore should be allowed the make their own choices, even if one of those choices will result in terrible financial ruin. On weakening Dodd-Frank, he said that certain aspects of the law impede economic growth while failing to truly make the financial system safer. On the optical issue of either move potentially saving banks—like the one he worked at two months ago—billions of dollars, Cohn demurred: “[This] has nothing to do with Goldman Sachs.” Consumer-protection fanatic Elizabeth Warren, for one, is not convinced. Is Goldman Sachs influencing policy at the White House, via Gary Cohn, she wondered? The answer is probably yes, kind of, in the sense that Cohn’s view of how the financial system should be regulated likely hasn’t changed in the eight weeks since he worked at Goldman Sachs and is probably broadly aligned with how the bank thinks the financial system should be regulated, considering that he was the second-most influential person there. What it probably doesn’t mean is that Goldman C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein is literally calling Cohn on his cell daily to get status updates on their secret plan to screw the little guy. But, God love her, that didn’t stop the senator from Massachusetts from trying to get Blankfein to admit as much. Per Business Insider: Democratic Senators Tammy Baldwin and Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein on Friday asking for information regarding Goldman Sachs' influence over the Trump administration. Specifically, Warren and Baldwin are concerned about how much input former and current Goldman Sachs employees have had over recent executive orders to roll back regulations on Wall Street, including the Dodd-Frank law that regulated banks after the financial crisis. “We are concerned that Mr. Cohn—who received an extraordinary $284 million handout from Goldman Sachs as he left his 25-year career with the firm—will be unable to develop economic policies that will help middle-class families, and will instead favor Wall Street over Main Street,” the letter read. “We hope you can provide us with information that will assuage our concerns.” Warren and Baldwin also requested that “all communication between employees of Goldman Sachs and Mr. Cohn related to the executive orders” and “all communication between Goldman Sachs and other high level Administration staffers.” Goldman Sachs told Business Insider, in response to the letter, “We've had no involvement in the drafting of any executive orders.“ Obviously. What else are they going to say or do? Give Warren permission to view the shared Google document between Blankfein and the White House? However Trump came by his opinions on Dodd-Frank, they aren’t new—and certainly predate Cohn’s involvement with his administration. On the campaign trail, Trump called the 2010 law “a disaster,” and his transition team vowed on November 10 to “dismantle” it. For all Trump’s populist rhetoric, he was probably always going to enact policies that put his “friends” first, and middle-class families second or third. He didn’t need Gary Cohn to tell him to do that. But we can’t fault Warren and her girl Baldwin for trying. After ranting and raving against Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz for their largely inconsequential relationships to Goldman, President Trump turned around and effectively opened a second D.C. branch of the bank within the White House. Voters should be reminded of that. If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, click here to subscribe. Trump tax plan looks out for its corporate bros On Thursday, Donald Trump announced that his forthcoming tax plan will be both “big league” and “phenomenal,” and then proceeded to provide exactly zero details of what the plan will actually entail. As of Friday, we still don’t really have any specifics, but we do know that Gary Cohn (yes, him again) will be spearheading the thing. Cohn has reportedly met with members of Congress and is “working on two key goals: cutting corporate income taxes and individual income taxes.” When it comes to the latter, Cohn said previously, “We’re not spending a lot of time with the high earners,” so make of that what you will. As for the former, apparently all options are on the table, “including the plan favored by [Paul] Ryan that would cut the corporate-tax rate to 20 percent and tax U.S. companies on their domestic income and imports, while exempting their exports and offshore income.” Trump said during his campaign that he wants to cut the corporate-tax rate to 15 percent. So maybe it’ll be somewhere in the middle, or maybe it’ll be 7.5 percent! Stranger things have come out of this White House. Trump blinks on Beijing During the whole of his campaign and until, well, Thursday, Donald Trump said terrible things about China, needlessly antagonizing Beijing by taking a call with the leader of Taiwan, in violation of decades of diplomatic protocol. Then, this week, Trump abruptly backtracked. The president sent a very un-Trump like letter to China, thanking President Xi Jinping for his congratulations on winning the election and belatedly “wished the Chinese people a happy Year of the Rooster,” according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer. (This happened after reports that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump had been asked to “smooth“ things over, meaning the letter was the presidential equivalent of a child who’s been pulled aside by his parent and told in no uncertain terms to march back over there and apologize.) Then things took an even crazier turn: Trump had a conversation with a world leader in which he didn’t fly off the handle or make any threats (at least none that we know about). Per Bloomberg: Donald Trump reaffirmed the U.S.’s support for the “One-China” policy in his first phone call as president with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, easing a key source of diplomatic tension between the world’s two largest economies. “The two leaders discussed numerous topics and President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our “One-China” policy,” the White House said in a statement Thursday. “They also extended invitations to meet in their respective countries. President Trump and President Xi look forward to further talks with very successful outcomes.” Has reason and logic descended on the White House? Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. It may be more a matter of a person only having a certain amount of bandwidth in them to act out daily. This was, after all, the same day that Trump tweeted, in response to a federal appeals court refusing to reinstate his travel ban, “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!” There’s only so much action one man can handle. Flattery pays off for Japan Also on the campaign trail, Trump accused Japan of stealing American jobs and not paying enough for U.S. security. But in the West Wing today, it was all smiles. Per Reuters: President Donald Trump on Friday praised the alliance between the United States and Japan as a cornerstone of regional peace and stability, edging away from campaign pledges to force Tokyo to pay more for the U.S. security umbrella. “We are committed to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control and to further strengthening our very crucial alliance,” Trump said [at a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe]. “The bond between our two nations and the friendship between our two peoples runs very, very deep. This administration is committed to bringing those ties even closer,” he added. While it’s difficult to explain any of Trump’s actions and even more difficult to explain his about-faces, Abe may have been able to extract some kind words from the 45th president by signing up for a weekend of golf and what we can only assume will be comments like “Tell me more about the origins of this gold-and-marble pool house.” Per the Journal: As heads of state around the world struggle to figure out how to handle the unpredictable new American president, Japan’s leader is honing a strategy of building personal ties first, fretting policy gaps second. So when Japanese officials talk about Mr. Abe’s two-day summit with Mr. Trump, they emphasize the weekend trip to his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Fla. more than the Friday meeting at the White House. “The highlight and crux of this trip is the match between the two leaders over golf,” said one person familiar with Mr. Abe’s planning.

John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Feb 10, 2017 at 4:39PM Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) announced on Friday that it is acquiring a majority stake in artificial-intelligence start-up Argo AI for $1 billion, to be paid over five years. What is Argo AI? Argo AI is a new company, founded late last year by CEO Bryan Salesky and COO Peter Rander. Both are big names in self-driving circles: Salesky was the head of hardware at Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo unit (formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project); Rander was a top engineer in Uber Technologies' autonomous-vehicle division. Both were previously at the robotics institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where they worked on artificial-intelligence (AI) technology. The plan for Argo AI is to use the founders' expertise in AI to develop autonomous-vehicle software. The company is headquartered in Pittsburgh. It's small now, but it expects to have more than 200 employees by the end of 2017. Argo COO Peter Rander (left), Ford CEO Mark Fields, Argo CEO Brian Salesky, and Ford CTO Raj Nair. Image source: Ford Motor Company. What Ford said about the deal Ford said that Argo AI "is bringing together some of the most experienced roboticists and engineers working in autonomy from inside and outside of Ford." An existing Ford team that has been working on what Ford calls its "virtual driver system," the brain of an autonomous vehicle, will become part of Argo AI. While Ford will continue to develop its self-driving hardware in-house, it appears that Argo AI will be responsible for much of the software development. That software could be licensed to other companies, CEO Mark Fields said, and it's possible that Argo AI will go public at some point. "The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," Fields said. "As Ford expands to be an auto and a mobility company, we believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future." Ford will hold a majority stake in the new company. Fields wouldn't say exactly what Ford's ownership percentage will be, but he did say that it was gauged to leave plenty of room to provide equity compensation to new employees. Ford's global product chief and CTO, Raj Nair, and group vice president of global strategy, John Casesa, will hold two of the five seats on Argo AI's board. Salesky and Rander will hold two more, and the fifth will go to an independent director to be named later. Investors, take note: Fields said that Argo AI's spending and results will be consolidated into Ford's automotive financial results, primarily in the North America region. What this deal is really about Here's how I'm thinking about this deal: Ford just hired two rock stars in AI and autonomous vehicles, put them in charge of its self-driving software team, and structured the whole thing to give the team members -- and very importantly, future hires, in a field in which the competition for talent is fierce -- the upside of a start-up with lower risk, because Ford's investment has essentially capitalized the company and Ford will be its first customer. It's an intriguing idea; it could turn out to be a brilliant one. During a conference call for analysts and media, Salesky emphasized that the structure of what he called the "collaboration" between Argo AI and Ford would help recruiting: New hires (and Ford's existing virtual-driver team) will go to work for a start-up with significant potential upside, not (directly, at least) for giant Ford. And while it's a start-up, Ford's involvement means that new hires can be assured that Argo AI has both solid funding and a major customer. The combination of relatively low risk with high potential upside should make for a potent recruiting tool in a field where the competition for talent has been extremely fierce. The upshot: An intriguing move to boost Ford's technology push For Ford, this is a way to bring some deep AI expertise into its self-driving development project, structured in a way that will help boost its recruiting efforts going forward. Nair said that he doesn't expect the deal to "accelerate" Ford's effort -- he stuck by the previously announced 2021 deadline for Ford's first mass-produced self-driving vehicle. But there's a clear advantage to putting the team under the leadership of Salesky and Rander, in a company that offers the upside of a start-up with less risk than most. We'll have to wait to learn more about the structure of the deal to evaluate it fully, but right now it looks like Ford has taken an intriguing step ahead.

Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption HTC Vive has been outselling the Oculus Rift I first tried the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset in the corner of a drab conference room in Las Vegas. I was convinced within seconds - despite feeling a little dizzy - that the device, held together by duct tape and hope, was destined for big things. A year or so later, I met the same company, Oculus VR, in a (slightly) fancier room at the E3 gaming event in Los Angeles. "Hold this," I said, abruptly thrusting an audio cable into the hands of a young man who I thought was helping out - but was in fact the company's chief executive, Palmer Luckey. Again, I was blown away by the technology. The next time I'd meet Luckey he'd be many, many millions of dollars richer, and Oculus would be a Facebook-owned company. But despite that very real marker of success, our topic of conversation each time we met remained the same: How are you going to convince people it's worth it? And isn't it going to be way too expensive? "It isn't," he said the last time I asked him - but he's wrong. At around $600 (plus a powerful PC) to get started, it is too expensive. But money isn't the problem. The price of the technology will come down, and I'm still convinced virtual reality be a success - but will it be Facebook's success? The company's strategy in this blossoming market is under question. Best Buy retreat This week we learned that demo stations set up in Best Buy - the huge US technology retail chain - are being rolled back due to poor foot traffic. Facebook has described the move as a "seasonal" change, but suffice it to say, if they were shifting units they'd still be there. Instead, 200 of the 500 stations across the US are being shut down. It's a potentially troubling moment for the company. Those who back virtual reality - myself included - always subscribed to the view that the key to selling them would be to get people to try it out. Once you've been in VR, we all assumed, you'd be hooked, and your wallet would follow soon after. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Google's Daydream VR system could be a threat to Facebook's budget VR success But that doesn't seem to have been the case. For whatever reason, too few people were bothering to even try the demo, let alone buy the product. There are a few theories for this, but the most likely, in my mind, was suggested by NPR's Molly Wood. The problem, she observed recently, might be the "pink-eye factor”. She said: "It could be as simple as - and I have said this a million times - not wanting to go into a store and put something on your face that has been on a bunch of other people's faces." But that wouldn't explain why the Oculus Rift is apparently performing poorly against its closest rival. At the high-end of the virtual reality market, Oculus is up against HTC's Vive, an extremely capable device which has the involvement of Valve, the revered games publisher. Good enough Unofficial data (which I'm using as the companies themselves haven't shared sales figures with us) suggest that the Vive, despite being more expensive, is trouncing Oculus. Games research firm SuperData estimated that 420,000 Vive headsets were sold in 2016, compared to 250,000 sales for the Oculus Rift. The lower end of the market is far more positive for Facebook. The Samsung Gear VR runs the Oculus VR experience, and that is by far and away the most popular device for VR on the market today, according to SuperData. But the hardware is all Samsung's and, for the most part, the headset itself (a simple plastic frame with lenses) has been given away with many smartphones. The hope that the Gear VR might act as a kind of gateway drug into pricier VR experiences has yet to come to fruition. Or maybe it has, just not for Oculus: the middle ground in VR is Sony's PlayStation VR, $399 and works with the PlayStation 4. It's more powerful than the Gear VR, but less powerful than the high-end headsets. But here's where Facebook should be worried - it seems to be good enough for most gamers. And it's "good enough" that makes Facebook's strategy all the more precarious. Who is the Oculus Rift for, exactly? Super serious gamers are gravitating to the HTC Vive. Moderately serious gamers are happy with PlayStation VR. And at the budget end, the Gear VR, while popular now, faces a clear and present threat from Daydream, Google's new VR ecosystem which is far more open. While Gear VR insists you have a Samsung smartphone, Daydream is designed to eventually work with any sufficiently powerful Android device (and it wouldn't be too tricky to make it work with Apple's iOS, either). This compatibility comes at a price, mind - the Daydream View headset is far less comfortable, in my experience, than the Gear VR. But it's comfortable enough, and the little handheld controller provides a far more intuitive way of navigating the VR world than tapping blindly at the side of your head, a la Gear VR. Here comes Hugo So what are the next steps if Facebook is to get on top of this? I'd ask Palmer Luckey, but he's hard to reach at the moment - hidden away from public view after controversy surrounding his support of Donald Trump which involved funding a hateful trolling group. He still works at the company, but Facebook and Oculus have repeatedly refused to tell me what his job actually is. (Palmer, if you're reading... my Twitter direct messages are open!) The only public appearance he has made since that debacle has been to turn up in court where Facebook (unsuccessfully) defended against claims Oculus illegally used intellectual property belonging to games publisher Zenimax in the early days. A $500m bill for damages awaits, unless Facebook can win on appeal. Image copyright Facebook Image caption Mark Zuckerberg has brought on ex-Google executive Hugo Barra In a recent earnings call, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is still incredibly enthusiastic about VR and what it means for his network's future, called for patience from his investors. "It's not going to be really profitable for a while," he said. He's never claimed otherwise, it has to be said. VR appears on Facebook's 10-year strategy, a slow burner with potentially big rewards. But falling behind now would be a serious blow, which is why Zuckerberg has brought in Hugo Barra, a man most recently at Chinese firm Xiaomi, but before that, a major name at Google. He'll be in charge of Facebook's efforts in virtual reality from here on in. In Barra, Oculus gains both a visionary and a safe pair of hands. He having worked on Android, today's most popular smartphone platform. At Xiaomi, his role was to help the company expand globally - and while the company didn't, as some had expected, break into the US under Barra's watch, it did cement a reputation as making good quality devices. He hasn't started his new role at Facebook just yet - he'll be at the company in a month or so, apparently excited to be back in California after a few years away. When he starts his first day - I feel those two questions I've been asking Palmer Luckey still stand: Isn't it still too expensive? And more importantly - how are you going to convince people it's worth it?

Although there's no timeline on when the SpaceX IPO will take place, the company's cutting-edge spacecraft and $12 billion valuation ensure it will rank among the biggest IPOs of the decade. You see, the company's goals expand beyond just launching cool rockets. Elon Musk, SpaceX's prolific CEO, plans to start developing a human colony on Mars by 2022. This seemingly impossible task is why Musk is determined to accomplish it. "We have goals that are absurdly ambitious by any reasonable standard, but we're going to make them happen," Musk says on the SpaceX website. Must Read: Former Google Exec Quits Dream Job to Launch Marijuana Empire Despite this long-term mission, launching rockets is still the company's bread and butter right now. A supply launch using one of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets costs third-party clients like NASA roughly $62 million. For the company's much larger Falcon Heavy, it costs around $90 million. And the company just announced a new launch initiative that could drastically increase the price of SpaceX shares once the firm goes public. With a sky-high share price, SpaceX stock will make an unprecedented splash when it debuts on the stock market. Here's why this big SpaceX news could influence the SpaceX IPO… This News Just Boosted the Pre-IPO Value of SpaceX Shares On Monday, Feb. 6, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said the company plans to increase the launch frequency of its Falcon 9 rockets to every two to three weeks. This will be the company's fastest rate of launches since Falcon 9 launches began in 2010. Since the start of 2015, SpaceX has only launched between seven and nine Falcon 9 rockets each year. The ambitious schedule will start once the firm's new Florida launch pad at Kennedy Space Center is operational. According to Shotwell, the company will also modify the Falcon 9's engines to boost performance and improve safety. The news comes after SpaceX's huge rocket explosion in September 2016 at the firm's original Cape Canaveral launch site. The blast was reportedly felt for miles and completely destroyed the rocket and $200 million satellite it was transporting. Interested in SpaceX Shares? Here's How to Invest in the Biggest Tech IPO of 2017 But SpaceX's newest effort to ramp up supply launches will undoubtedly attract more funding in 2017. The company has already accrued $1.1 billion over seven funding rounds. Its stunning 3,233% growth from $30 million in Series D funding to $1 billion in Series E crushed the growth of higher-valued companies over the same rounds. Flipkart, for example, only saw funding increase by 140% from $150 million to $360 million over the same rounds. This chart below shows the highest-valued private companies in the world, with SpaceX holding the 11th-place spot… The $12 billion SpaceX valuation – as well as the firm's impressive funding growth – ensure the SpaceX IPO will be a huge market event. That leaves the most important question in the wake of the recent SpaceX news… Will Shares of SpaceX Stock Hit the Market in 2017? The company hasn't filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an IPO yet. And unfortunately, SpaceX probably won't go public in 2017 for two important reasons… First and foremost, SpaceX's primary business is experimenting with rockets. This has obviously led to launch failures. The one last September was its fifth failure since 2006. Because the company currently deals with this kind of trial and error, SpaceX stock wouldn't be the most welcome investment on Wall Street right now. Short-term incidents like these could scare investors into selling their SpaceX stock, which would harm the company's goals beyond rocket launches. The second reason is that Elon Musk simply doesn't want to take the company public anytime soon. At Tesla Inc.'s (Nasdaq: TSLA) annual shareholder meeting in June 2015, he said keeping SpaceX private is crucial to fulfilling the long-term goal of Mars colonization. When asked about the SpaceX IPO, he said it will happen "once flights to Mars begin." The Bottom Line: Investors have been wanting to own SpaceX shares for years now. Despite the five launch failures over the last decade, SpaceX has still managed to stoke plenty of interest from people looking for an ambitious company with a revolutionary mission. SpaceX's announcement this week that it will ramp up rocket launches continues to prove it will be a thrilling stock to buy. But don't plan on the SpaceX IPO happening in 2017. The experimental nature of its business and Musk's focus on colonizing Mars ensure it will remain private for the foreseeable future. Editor's Note: One of the fastest-growing tech investment segments is… cannabis? Yes, you read that right. A high-tech approach to cultivating this ancient plant – that's already legal to use in more than half of 50 states – is generating a multibillion-dollar investment opportunity for early investors.

(Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer) Opening night red carpet gala When: 8 p.m. March 2 Where: Boulder Theater, 2032 14th St. Cost: $50, free for passholders Pre-party: 5:30-7:30 p.m.at Hotel Boulderado and Rembrandt Yard Screening: "Their Finest" (2016, United Kingdom, 116 minutes), a rousing romantic comedy following a female screenwriter during World War II, starring Gemma Arterton, Sam Clatlin and Bill Nighy. Closing night When: 7:30 p.m. March 5 Where: Boulder Theater, 2032 14th St. Cost: $30, free for passholders Screening: "Chasing Coral" (2017, Boulder 93 minutes), fresh from winning an audience award at Sundance, BIFF's closing night film follows a team of divers, photographers and scientists on an ocean adventure to discover why coral reefs are vanishing around the world. Directed by Boulder's Jeff Orlowski; produced by Longmont's Larissa Rhodes More information at biff1.com A truck delivering the Boulder International Film Festival's programs may have severed the power to the festival's office on Friday, but co-founder and director Kathy Beeck's excitement in sharing the 2017 lineup and details for the March festival far outweighed her tinge of concern. New this year, BIFF will expand its boundaries beyond the real world with its Virtual Reality Pavilion. "It is going to be pretty cool," Beeck said. "We'll have eight virtual reality films screening at Galvanize, and we'll have a whole variety of different headsets — from very high tech to cardboard ones." Boulder technical school and co-working space Galvanize, 1023 Walnut St., will be one venue the festival will utilize for its programming. Over the long weekend, films will be screened at various spots in Boulder and Longmont. The Virtual Reality Pavilion will be free and open to the public March 3 and 4, and will have Google's Nicholas Whitaker on hand to moderate a few of the talks, Beeck said. "Swing by, put on a headset and learn about the future of storytelling," Beeck said. BIFF will screen 58 films, three of which are Sundance Film Festival award-winning films and four are nominated for Academy Awards. And 23 of these films were directed by females, Beeck said. The popular shorts programs, which Beeck said are always the first to sell out, expanded to include four different programs this year. "We are so excited about this year's program," said BIFF executive director Robin Beeck, Kathy's sister, in a news release. "This is a stellar lineup with award-winning films from the world's greatest directors and from fresh, new filmmakers just hitting the scene. We're thrilled to be able to present a feast of the best films today." Robin and Kathy Beeck, the two sisters who run and founded the Boulder International Film Festival. (Courtesy photo) Kathy Beeck said there will be eight Colorado films screened — and she realized during the interview that all eight of those local filmmakers are from Boulder. "That just tells us something about how much is happening in film in Boulder," Kathy Beeck said. "We are so proud of the major filmmakers in this town." Among Boulder highlights is the closing night film "Chasing Coral," a documentary produced by a local company that just won the Audience Award for best U.S. documentary at Sundance. Boulder filmmaker Jeff Orlowski and Longmont producer Larissa Rhodes, the team behind "Chasing Coral," also produced "Chasing Ice," the 2012 Emmy award-winning documentary on climate change. "Chasing Coral" explores the danger the world's coral reefs face amid global warming. A local team of filmmakers (with many University of Colorado graduates, Rhodes said in an interview last month) from Boulder's Exposure Labs created the documentary. Kathy Beeck said festival-goers can also see "Chasing Coral, the Virtual Reality Experience" premiere at Galvanize. Other highlights: • "Maurizio Cattelan: Be Right Back," (4:30 p.m. March 3) produced by Boulderite Maura Axelrod, about contemporary pop artist Maurizio Cattelan, which Kathy Beeck said is "a fabulous movie, really well done." • "Rumble: The Indians Who Rocked the World" (7 p.m. March 3), is a film about the role of Native Americans and indigenous influence in popular music history. "It goes back into history in the film, and it's so stunning to realize that Jimi Hendrix and Robbie Robertson (The Band) have Native American heritage," Beeck said. "Tony Bennett is in the film talking about his early influences." • Cinechef 2017 (5-7 p.m. March 3) at Rembrandt Yard Art Gallery and Event Center, 1301 Spruce St., is in its third year as a part of BIFF and will feature eight of the best chefs in town, Kathy Beeck said. "It's a foodie event that highlights the spectacular food scene in Boulder while we highlight Boulder filmmakers," she said. "I'm loving this event." The festival runs March 2 through 5 and tickets are on sale at biff1.com.

Elyse Betters10 February 2017Phones Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple's Siri has bright waves. Microsoft's Cortana has a circle. Amazon's Alexa has an A. Google Assistant has colourful bars. But what will Samsung's Bixby have? Thanks to several reports, we know that Samsung is planning to make a new AI assistant a major part of its next flagship Galaxy S8 phone and maybe even smart home strategy. There has been plenty of speculation about its features, which you can read about from here, and that it will be called Bixby. Details on the assistant are scarce. Nevertheless, a new report claims to reveal how Bixby's logo might look.  European Trade Mark Neowin spotted a Samsung trademark application filed with the European Trade Mark and Design Network. It's for a “B” logo that may end up being the logo used for the Bixby AI. The filing explained that the logo is for “interactive computer software enabling exchange of information”, meaning an assistant. However, Neowin noted the logo appears similar to "8", which might mirror the Galaxy S8's branding. Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus: What's the story so far? The Galaxy S8 is expected to be released in March. If so, prepare to see Bixby unveiled around then too.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 11 February 2017 P&G Malaysia backs MRC viewability standards by daljit dhesi Nadiah: ‘For media buys, viewability is one of several important factors that we consider.’ P&G Malaysia is working closely with its partners to adopt the US-based Media Rating Council (MRC) viewability standards for digital media as well as reviewing agency contracts following the recent call by its parent Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) for greater transparency rules in digital advertising. Although the move has drawn mixed reactions from marketers and agencies, the company’s communications and government relations leader (Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei) Nadiah Syed Nahar tells StarBizWeek that it will follow through and adopt the MRC standard. P&G Malaysia is a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble Company of the US, which is the biggest advertiser in the world. She says P&G’s ruling are relevant and applicable globally, including in Malaysia. Many of P&G’s digital partners (Google, Facebook, etc) are global, she says, adding that the company will work with its partners and agencies on these issues. “Right now, at minimum, our focus is on the adoption of MRC viewability standard to enable comparative measurement and learning. For media buys, viewability is one of several important factors that we consider. We work with our partners on the specifics as to how we buy media from them. We are also currently reviewing agency contracts. “I can’t divulge at this stage except the fact that we are aligned with P&G’s chief brand officer Marc Pritchard’s direction and intent of reviewing agency contracts. We have begun that work and it will continue on the timing that it takes,” she says. MediaCom is P&G’s media agency in Malaysia. Last month, Pritchard stressed that there was a need for a thorough review of all media-agency contracts plus requirements that everyone use industry-standard viewability metrics, fraud protection and third-party verification. The new rules scheduled to be out this year include requiring funds to be used for media payments only, ie, payments or fees should be matched with the services rendered. All rebates, at the same time, should be disclosed and returned as well as transactions being subjected to audit. Another is the endorsement by P&G of the controversial MRC viewability standards for digital media. It defines a viewable impression as requiring a minimum of 50% of pixels in view for one consecutive second for display and two consecutive seconds for video. Industry players agree there should be a common viewability standard in the advertising industry in the country as currently there are no fixed standards or measurements.  Tags / Keywords: Earnings , Economy , Advertising & Media , P G Related Stories MAS brings unity to new heights Malaysia an important part of China’s Asean expansion Serba Dinamik debuts on Bursa with 2 sen premium TA Global subsidiary completes Trump hotel acquisition F&N sees margins to remain pressured, acts to maintain revenue and profit growth You May Be Interested Spritzer starts UK exports Top Federal Reserve official resigns as bank deregulation looms Kuehner tasked with refreshing Celcom brand Ford to invest $1 bln in autonomous vehicle tech firm Argo AI Lundal picks Amazon as a model for Maxis Experiencing painful menses?

She will represent Louth at this highly competitive event in Google HQ on Sunday 5th March. She has developed a healthy food product based on noodles made from the flour of the Asian Konjac vegetable. The noodle based meals are low in sugar, fat free, practically carb free and very low in calories and are stocked in outlets throughout Ireland and will be moving into the UK market very soon. Roisin will be joined in the final by two young entrepreneurs from Meath: Alvin Hunt from Hexafly in the Best Idea Category and Barry Goulding BSG Design in the Best Established Business Category. Minister Damien English was guest of honour at the Regional Final last week. He explained "Young entrepreneurs are Ireland's job creators and innovators." He continued by encouraging young entrepreneurs to reach out to their Local Enterprise Office who are "on hand to help all businesses start-up, grow and expand." Thomas McEvoy, the Head of Enterprise in Louth, congratulated Roisin, saying: "Our search to find and support Ireland's best young entrepreneurs has turned up some incredible business talent. It's important to find, recognise and support them in their work because our local entrepreneurs are the business leaders of the future. We are so proud to see Louth represented in the IBYE National Final and we are backing Roisin all the way." Aimed at 18 to 35-year-olds, the IBYE initiative is run by the 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) nationwide, and supported by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland.

(Photo: Ford Motor Company) 60 CONNECTTWEET 45 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO — Ford is betting $1 billion on the world's self-driving car future through a majority investment in a small start-up company called Argo AI as it tries to win the high-stakes talent war in the emerging self-driving car industry. Ford said the deal combines a group of Ford employees along with Ford’s virtual driver system  — the brains of autonomous vehicles — with the talent and expertise of Argo AI's founders and their robotics experience. The company was cofounded a few months ago by Google car project veteran Bryan Salesky and Uber engineer Peter Rander, who met while working at Carnegie Mellon University's vaunted robotics and engineering school. Ford CEO Mark Fields and Argo AI executives declined to say exactly how much money Ford is paying to become a majority stakeholder in Argo AI, or even exactly how many employees currently work for the start-up. But they did make it clear that a good bit of the $1-billion figure will be deployed over a period of five years as the company works to attract and retain the brightest minds in the fast-paced self-driving vehicle industry, which has been marked by talent wars for the best engineers and software developers. ​In 2015, Uber poached about 40 engineers from Carnegie Mellon in a move that left one of the world’s top robotics research institutions in a crisis. Last month, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Sterling Anderson, the former director of its Autopilot program, for leaving the company to join Chris Urmson, a former director of Google's Self-Driving Car Project, to form a start-up called Aurora. "This is a move by Ford to be able to attract and retain talent," said Mike Ramsey, an analyst for Gartner, a research firm. "They are setting up a structure that allows them to pay big money…for some of these guys who are really hard to get." Argo AI, which is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pa., will have offices in Michigan and California and expects to have 200 employees by the end of this year. The company has been structured so it can operate independently of Ford. The structure gives Argo AI the ability to provide both Ford employees who will join the start-up and new Argo AI employees with significant equity ownership stakes in the company. "That is very important  …we are one team, we have to reflect that in the way we compensate everyone," said Raj Nair, Ford's executive vice president of product development. "Ford Motor Co.'s equity is based on the much larger automotive and manufacturing business." Ford's investment also is part of a continuing investment strategy anchored to transforming the car and truck seller into a mobility company with a hand in ride-hailing, ride-sharing and even bicycle rentals.

"This move gets us the agility and speed of a start-up combined with Ford's global scale." Salesky, a self-driving car hardware specialist who left Google's renamed Waymo car program last fall, said that he decided to start his own company with Rander because of "the incredible advancements in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision, but we just needed a partner to get these cars into the hands of millions of people." Salesky, who said he spoke with a number of partners, said he liked Ford's approach to self-driving cars better than other potential partners. "We were very impressed. When we talked to others, it was very clear that Ford was one of the few manufacturers that really understands the full ecosystem that needs to come together for self-driving cars," Salesky said. Ford has made other efforts to ramp up its self-driving car program. Last spring, Ford invested $182 million in Pivotal, a Silicon Valley-based software development company. Ford also said in August it would invest $75 million in Velodyne, a developer of light detection and ranging sensors essential for self-driving cars, and separately said it would double its staff in Palo Alto, Calif., to 260 by the end of this year. DETROIT FREE PRESS Ford to double Silicon Valley presence; invests $75M The Dearborn automaker said it plans to increase its team of researchers, engineers and scientists from 130 to 260 by the end of 2017. Ford's early stage investment in Argo AI reflects a growing desire on the part of automakers and tech companies to combine forces in order to tackle the still daunting task of making autonomous driving an everyday reality. Last year, General Motors paid $581 million to acquire Cruise Automation, a San Francisco-based start-up that develops software for autonomous vehicles.

Waymo CEO John Krafcik, a veteran of Hyundai North America, has also indicated that his company plans to sell its technology to other automakers. Chinese giant Baidu had hoped to give its self-driving program a boost through a partnership with BMW, before that venture fell through last fall due to differences on project trajectory. And a growing number of small start-ups, such as Silicon Valley's Drive.ai, also are looking to grab a slice of this pie. Most experts working in this increasingly crowded field are targeting 2021 for delivering autonomous cars to consumers, likely as part of a commercial ride-sharing fleet. Argo AI will focus on what amounts to the self-driving car's computer brain, which relies on computer algorithms to process data coming from an array of sensors — radar, lasers, cameras — that help the car navigate through its environment. "That virtual driver system, that brain, needs a platform to power, and that's where our expertise in building cars comes in," Nair said.

The study found that 77 percent of people regularly took selfies, but 82 percent said they would rather view 'normal' photos on social media. Scroll down for video  A new phenomenon questions the selfie-movement. Called 'selfie-paradox', researchers have found that many people regularly take selfies,like Kylie Jenner (pictured), but most people don't appear to like them SELFIES IN NUMBERS  Selfies are enormously popular on social media.  Google statistics have estimated that about 93 million selfies were taken per day in 2014, counting only those taken on Android devices.  Selfie accessories such as selfie sticks are now commonplace, as are selfie cameras on phones, and the word 'selfie' was even added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2013.  Selfie-paradox is a term coined by Sarah Diefenbach, a professor at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, who conducted an online survey to assess people's motives and judgments when taking and viewing selfies. The study included a total of 238 people in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, which found that 77 percent of participants regularly took selfies. 'One reason for this might be their fit with widespread self-presentation strategies such as self-promotion and self-disclosure' says Diefenbach. 'The selfie as a self-advertisement, plying the audience with one's positive characteristics or the selfie as an act of self-disclosure, sharing a private moment with the rest of the world and hopefully earning sympathy, appear to be key motivators,' she explains.

Share this article Share 55 shares Some view selfies as a creative outlet and a way to connect with other people and others seeing them as narcissistic, self-promotional and inauthentic. However, others argue that the nature of the selfie, a photo deliberately taken of oneself by oneself, means that selfies can never be an authentic glimpse into someone's life, but rather appear contrived and make the selfie-taker look self-absorbed. THREE TYPES OF SELFIES A researcher at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich has revealed that there are three types of selfies: self-promotion, self-disclosure and understatement. Self-promotion is a self-advertisement, plying the audience with one's positive characteristics. Researchers say they found three types of selfie - self-promotion, self-disclosure and  understatement. While self-disclosure is sharing a private moment with the rest of the world and hopefully earning sympathy. And the final type of selfie, understatement, is where someone portrays themselves and their achievements and abilities as unimportant. The study found that participants who scored highly on 'self-promotion' or 'self-disclosure' were more likely to be positive about taking selfies compared with participants who scored highly on 'understatement'.  A third form of self-presentation is categorized as understatement, where someone portrays themselves and their achievements and abilities as unimportant.  Participants who scored highly on 'self-promotion' or 'self-disclosure' were more likely to be positive about taking selfies compared with participants who scored highly on 'understatement'. The study also found that even though 77 percent of the participants reported taking selfies regularly, 62 percent to 67 percent noted that these images of negative consequences - such as impacts on self-esteem.  This negative perception of selfies was also illustrated by 82 percent of participants indicating that they would rather see other types of photos instead of selfies on social media. The study that 77% of people regularly took selfies, but 82 percent said they would rather view 'normal' photos on social media. Also, 62% to 67% noted that these images of negative consequences - such as impacts on self-esteem. Pictured is Lindsey Lohan taking a selfie WOMEN ARE SELFIE QUEENS   A recent study has revealed snap-happy young women are the most prolific of the selfie-snappers, spending a staggering five hours a week getting those shots just right.  The survey of 2,000 women found that those aged between 16 and 25 are the worst offenders, spending an average of 16 minutes on each selfie-session, three times a day. Over half said they take selfies 'all the time', with the average snap-rate coming in at three selfies a day. And with applying make-up, getting the right lighting and perfecting the angle, the time spent on each photo-taking session added up to 48 minutes a day - that's a baffling five hours and 36 minutes every week.  The research showed a significant trend among the younger generation to suffer from 'selfie-esteem' - linking their own body confidence with the amount of 'likes' they receive on a selfie via social media. In fact, a snap-happy 22 per cent even cited getting 'likes' to boost their ego as the main reason for taking them. But getting individual attention was also a factor, as one in three admitted to using their sexiest selfies to catch the eye of a potential love interest. And it's also an act of revenge. One in five confessed they'd posted suggestive pics of themselves to make an ex-partner regret ending their relationship. On a more concerning level, 27 per cent of the younger women confessed they actually delete selfies within minutes if they haven't gained enough 'likes' on social media. And four in ten said they take so many selfies they've become more analytical of their faces, finding flaws they hadn't previously seen.  These findings suggest that selfies should not be as popular as they are.  'The key to the paradox may lie in the way the participants view their own selfies, compared with those of others,' explained the researcher. The participants attributed greater self-presentational motives and less authenticity to selfies taken by others, compared with those taken by themselves, which were also judged as self-ironic and more authentic.  'This may explain how everybody can take selfies without feeling narcissistic. If most people think like this, then it is no wonder that the world is full of selfies,' Diefenbach explains.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 55 shares Most watched News videos Danielle Bregoli throws punches while boarding Spirit Airways Cameraman 'zooms in' on woman's breasts in 'see-through' swimsuit Caught on camera: Bystanders watch topless men fighting in street Moment Lindsay Hoyle and Alex Salmond scream at each other Danielle Bregoli discusses fighting a 'crack head' with her mom 'I don't take no s***': Bus driver kicks drunk man off bus Watch Barack Obama wipe out in kite surfing battle McConnell blocks Warren from reading letter from MLK's wife Footage shows hostile environment that Alexander Blackman endured Melissa McCarthy nails screeching Sean Spicer on SNL Danielle went viral after appearing on Dr Phil in 2016 Moment woman pops open her shirt by flexing her boobs Socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, 45, dies at her London...

These are the top stories of the week. 1. More than 100 companies filed an amicus brief voicing opposition to President Trump’s immigration ban executive order. Among them are Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Tesla, SpaceX, Airbnb and Twitter. The brief was tied into the case brought by the states of Minnesota and Washington. The Trump administration appealed the case to the 9th Circuit after a federal judge in Seattle halted the immigration ban, where it was then shut down.  2. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative announced it is donating $3.6 million to fight the San Francisco Bay housing crisis. A majority of the funding will go to Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto to address current hardships caused by the housing shortage. In addition, the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, the nonprofit medical research org created by the pair, announced it is giving $50 million to 47 disease research initiatives. 3. Starting next month, the FBI will no longer accept Freedom of Information Act requests by email, and will instead require a fax or snail mail. The decision to revert to archaic tech is troubling, but for FOIA filers, another layer of obfuscation is just business as usual. However, the portal’s new terms of service will let you send an unlimited number of requests. 4. Google officially launched Android Wear 2.0, the biggest update to the company’s wearable OS since its launch in 2014. The updated version feels a lot like the next logical evolution, and the OS is launching on two new flagship watches from LG. 5. Jawbone has run out of money. The fitness band maker that originally started out in headsets and speakers will stop selling consumer hardware in favor of a new business model and manufacturing health devices. Jawbone is also trying to raise more money for this new endeavor. 6. Former Democratic campaigner John Podesta has spoken up about the WikiLeaks email hack that occurred in the final month before the 2016 election. TechCrunch spoke with him about cybersecurity, fake news and Russia. 7. Airbnb is growing. Just after the company bought payments startup Tilt for $50 million, we learned that Airbnb is also acquiring Luxury Retreats, a service that focuses on high-end homes, for a price believed to be around $200 million. 8. Just a few days after announcing Jay Fulcher as its new CEO, Zenefits laid off 45 percent of its workforce. The company said it simply had to cut costs, and is going to centralize its operations group in Arizona. 9. Mike Rothenberg, the VC who came under scrutiny after a SEC investigation and several fraud allegations, is reverting the branding of Frontier Tech Ventures back to Rothenberg Ventures. 10. Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial looks to be on the cusp of a global M&A spree. The company is reportedly close to raising nearly $3 billion in debt financing in order to bankroll more acquisitions. 11. It looks like the U.S. IPO landscape may be heating up in 2017 after all. A Chinese photo-sharing app called Kuaishou is planning to go public in the U.S. later this year. Sources tell us the Instagram-like app has more than 40 million DAU against 100 million MAU, and was recently valued at around $3 billion. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories Prince Returns To Spotify | Crunch Report VIDEO | 2:38 | Crunch Report Carl Bass on his surprising Autodesk exit — and what’s next 13 hours ago | Connie Loizos Uncorking innovation with Treasury Wine Estates in Napa 14 hours ago | Lora Kolodny Beats X bring Apple’s wireless headphone tech to a tethered form factor 16 hours ago | Brian Heater Facebook says it will open up for independent ad audit 18 hours ago | Anthony Ha Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report: Prince returns to Spotify 9 hours ago | Anthony Ha Trump’s immigration ban is terrible for entrepreneurs 10 hours ago | Samia Bahsoun Payback’s a gift 11 hours ago | Talia Goldberg, Jeremy Levine Sen.

(Carlos Osorio/Associated Press) Related Stories Ford CEO hopeful Trump will ease fuel economy standards 2017 Detroit auto show presents new and electrifying ideas Here's how chip companies are giving self-driving cars the gift of sight Automakers take differing routes to self-driving future Ford Motor Co. plans to invest $1 billion US over the next five years in tech startup Argo AI to help the Detroit automaker reach its goal of producing a self-driving vehicle for commercial ride sharing fleets by 2021, the companies announced on Friday. The investment in Pittsburg-based Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber , will make Ford the company's largest shareholder. Ford chief executive officer Mark Fields said the investment is in line with previous announcements on planned capital expenditures. Argo AI, which focuses on artificial intelligence and robotics, will help build what Ford calls its "virtual driver system" at the heart of the fully autonomous car Ford said last year it would develop by 2021. "With Argo AI's agility and Ford's scale we're combining the benefits of a technology start up with the experience and discipline we have at Ford," Fields said at a press conference. Once the technology is fully developed for Ford, it could be licensed to other companies, executives said. While Ford will retain a majority of the start-up's equity, the potential for an equity stake as Argo AI hires 200 more employees will be an advantage in recruiting talent, executives said. "They have the opportunity to run it pretty independently with a board, but because it is a separate company or subsidiary, it has the opportunity to go out and recruit with competitive compensation packages and equity," Fields said. Until now, Ford's investments in future transportation technology have been relatively modest, compared with those of General Motors Co and others. One of Ford's largest such investments in the past year was $75 million US to buy a minority stake in Velodyne, a manufacturer of laser-based lidar sensing systems for self-driving cars. Rival GM made a billion-dollar bet a year ago with its acquisition of Silicon Valley self-driving startup Cruise Automation. GM also invested $500 million US to buy a nine-per cent stake in San Francisco-based ride services firm Lyft, a competitor to Uber. © Thomson Reuters, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Latest Business Headlines 4 reasons for concern buried in Friday's booming jobs report February 11, 5:00 AM ET read comments TSX, Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all hit new closing highs February 10, 4:42 PM ET read comments Ex-SNC Lavalin execs acquitted of bribery charges after wiretap evidence nixed February 10, 7:36 PM ET #baycott: Hudson's Bay under pressure to drop Ivanka Trump products February 10, 8:13 PM ET read comments video Ford investing $1B US in autonomous vehicle tech firm Argo AI February 10, 3:28 PM ET Must Watch Video Job gains 5:46 Frances Donald, senior economist, Manulife Financial, on Canada's January jobs report Video Alberta outlook 4:18 Wendy Giuffre, president, Wendy Ellen Inc., on the prospects for the province's oil and gas sector Video The Trump brand image 6:36 Ron Tite, CEO, The Tite Group, on calls for boycotts of stores that carry Ivanka Trump brand products Video Battery life 6:16 Jeff Dahn work developing a 30-year battery has already caught the attention of Tesla Watch The Exchange here Watch Recent shows and interviews Recent discussions about business news and newsmakers Markets TSX COMPOSITE   Rotate stock indices Pause stock rotation Show previous stock PLAY Feb 11, 2017 12:00 AM ET Feb 11, 2017 12:00 AM ET Feb 11, 2017 12:00 AM ET Feb 11, 2017 12:00 AM ET Feb 11, 2017 12:00 AM ET Index Last Trade Change TSX COMPOSITE 15729.12 111.82 DOW 20269.37 96.97 NASDAQ 5734.13 18.95 SP 500 2316.10 8.23 TSX-VENTURE 836.16 10.28 The data on this site is informational only and may be delayed; it is not intended as trading or investment advice and you should not rely on it as such.

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here CHENNAI: Mobile phone and parts manufacturers are lobbying for continuity of duty conditions that led to a groundswell in electronics manufacturing since 2015 and one of the key factors for Taiwanese phone-maker Foxconn trying to take over the shuttered Nokia plant which knocked India off the phone export global map with its closure. Phone-makers have expressed concern that the latest Budget had few markers that committed to incentives for making in India. The Indian Cellular Association, which counts Apple and Google as its members, is pursuing its case with the central ministries to ensure duty advantages stay and are expanded under the GST regime. Pankaj Mohindroo, the national president of the Indian Cellular Association, however, was confident that the finance ministry would soon make up for the Budget lapses: “There has been an oversight. There are more verticals like keypads and such that need to be announced under the Phased Manufacturing Programme. We are certain it will be implemented and no one should hold back investment plans due to this lapse.” Multiple phone makers had set up factories in clusters around Noida, Uttar Pradesh, and in Andhra Pradesh and in other states after a counter-vailing duty imposed by the Centre in its 2015 Budget that made it cheaper for brands to make in India than import from China. This move was followed by with similar duty regimes for batteries, chargers, and adapters. Called the Phased Manufacturing Programme, the concept was to expand the incentive establishment to many other avenues in electronics manufacturing to touch a target of making 500 million phones, Rs 50,000 crore from the components industry and generate employment of 15 lakh workers by 2019-20. The Fast Track Task Force, set up to accelerate phone and part manufacturing in the country, had led to 35 new plants and 15 factories for components in the one year up to August last year. With the Budget 2017 showing little promise and little assurance of the Goods and Services Taxes regime perpetuating these duty incentives, the manufacturers are worried. Sasikumar Gendham, managing director of Indian subsidiary of Finnish firm Salcomp, said: “Thousands of jobs and crores have been invested with the duty differential as a key contributor. In three years, Indian manufacturers may not need them. But now, they are necessary. Many Chinese suppliers are looking at these tax conditions to invest in India,” he said. Salcomp, which runs a sole factory inside the 212-acre Nokia SEZ, is buying another factory to expand operations. Gendham said companies have begun dialogues with officials with the central government. “While they are seized of the matter, clarity is yet to emerge on how things will look under GST,” he said. The $150-billion revenue company Foxconn is amidst its second inning in the country after Nokia’s closure. The Apple phone manufacturer had expressed interest in the Nokia factory, but had laid out clear conditions, among others, that the tax liabilities that did in the factory should not be brought back to haunt Foxconn. Another industry representative with knowledge of Foxconn India operations said: “It is important that an ecosystem for not just phone makers but also suppliers to make in India. For foreign makers, a demonstrable, repeatable policy structure is required to take India seriously.” Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Google's Chrome Web browser now supports the WebVR virtual reality platform, enabling anyone to experience 360-degree photos, videos, and other content originally designed for VR headsets on their desktops or laptops. Taking VR out of the headset and onto the Chrome browser is a big step forward in making the technology more accessible. It's hardly the first step—Mozilla has been working on something similar for Firefox, and WebVR has already been included in beta versions of Chrome. But given the browser's popularity, it will now be many people's first foray into virtual worlds. WebVR is designed to unify the VR experience across devices with varying degrees of computing power. In theory, that means that photos and video should look as smooth on the Web as they do in a Google Daydream View or a Samsung Gear VR. That's certainly the case with the demos Google offered in a blog post this week, including a collection of more than 300,000 celebrity homes, museums, canyons, and iconic architecture. Related The Best VR (Virtual Reality) Headsets of 2017 The Best VR (Virtual Reality) Headsets of 2017 Ensuring a consistent experience by adhering to WebVR standards, though, is largely up to developers. Google offers extensive developer resources, including guidelines like the all-important frame rate, which can give viewers motion sickness if it's too low. WebVR content on mobile Chrome browsers should have a minimum rate of 60fps, while desktop browsers shouldn't go below 90fps, Google says. "By assuming a non-VR environment first you can maximize the reach of your experiences, and ensure that you're providing the best possible experience no matter what setup your users have," Google wrote on its developer support page. Google's frame rates are consistent with what Mozilla is telling its developers, too. It's worth noting, however, that despite the hardware diversity that WebVR is theoretically capable of supporting, you won't yet be able to experience actual VR in Chrome unless you're using Daydream with a compatible phone. For now, that means iOS and other Android users are left out. Back to top Previous : How to Star in a Virtual Reality Movie By Tom Brant Tom is PCMag's San Francisco-based news reporter.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Blu drops Windows Phones from their redesigned home page -1 by Surur  @mspoweruser Aug 26, 2016 at 22:13 GMT6 months ago Microsoft’s grand strategy with Windows 10 Mobile was to let 3rd party OEMs carry the weight of the hardware ecosystem, rather than Microsoft Mobile/Nokia, but as AdDuplex’s data has shown this has been far from the case. Now it seems there has been another example of the failure of the strategy, with relatively high profile OEM Blu removing all mention of Windows Phones from its redesigned home page (above). Blu released a number of rebranded white box Windows Reference Design handsets, but appeared to work harder than other OEMs to promote and support the devices, including releasing the Windows 10 Mobile upgrade for eligible handsets. The company is however clearly de-emphasising their Windows Phone devices, and I expect a 3rd generation of Microsoft handsets are unlikely. When Microsoft “retrenched” from the Windows Phone device ecosystem they left a vacuum which was not filled by Windows Phones by other OEMs but rather by Android devices, leading to significant market share gains by Google over the last 12 months, especially in Europe.  The reason is of course pretty clear – Nokia and Microsoft’s combined brand was the main reason consumers were buying the handsets, and with Nokia leaving the scene and Microsoft giving Windows Phone a massive vote of no confidence there was clearly very little reason for consumers to invest in Windows Phones from other brands. Given the numerous examples of lack of traction by 3rd party OEMs I do not expect the future will look much different. Last year Satya Nadella said if 3rd party OEMs do not step up to the plate they would take up the mantle themselves again. It seems clear to me at this stage that if Microsoft is serious about having a mobile presence then they might as well start revving up those factories again.

Jeff Daly So pointing showing an ACTUAL page from an ACTUAL website that ACTUALLY exists is delusional?? You need a dictionary. Jeff Daly You know because you say so and repeat your hate in a REALLY obsessive way. Jerry As long as i keep getting updates on my windows 10 OS I won’t have a problem.I’ve got the apps that I need so far.I doubt Microsoft wouldn’t be investing their time on the Insider platform for nothing.Next year could be Microsoft’s year who knows.What Blu did was a greater possibility considering Window’s state. anchovylover You know Nokia will be making Android phones, right? anchovylover The problem for MS is they just can’t keep ” resetting ” their mobile plans and leaving their loyal users feeling abandoned. Sooner or later those loyal users will move on and there is evidence to suggest a lot already have. anchovylover OK, not a fan then 🙂 Fahd A. Santiago Ortiz It’s just an OS beta and never listen to users they don’t approach their entire ecosystem (Xbox, pc, surface, sync…) no just the “one core” but, apps just for the W10 and all devices (Xbox direct connection, etc)… Sam Iam Yes, no OEM is going to invest in Windows phones. There is just no market for them. It’s done. HP must be pretty upset as they thought they would be bringing out x3 after Windows 10 was in full swing, but they are bringing it out into a dead ecosystem. Iamanan Emmanuel Sure, and if they’re good my lumia is retired. anchovylover It would be surprising if Nokia came back only to release second rate phones. They will be ok. johala02 They licensed out the Nokia brand to Microsoft so they technically never sold it completly. 3 year for smartphones. And 10 year for the featurephones. But Nokia got back the brand much earlier than planned when Nadella “retrenching” the Microsoft mobile strategy. Good for Nokia that can back on the track much faster with featurephones and their coming Android devices. It will be HMD Global/Foxconn who do them of course. But all devices will have the Nokia brand. Gregory C Newman From what info I’ve read on the Web it appears that Microsoft will retire it’s Lumia line of Smartphones and in 2017 introduce it’s new “Surface” line of smart phones with big Advertisements, Loads of Support. Last I read there will be an ARMS CPU “Surface” Flagship Continuum capable Microsoft smartphone that will be very similar to the HP Elite X3. it’s targeted to be sold to “Business” and Windows smart phones Enthusiasts. This is sad because Microsoft does need to sell cheaper Windows 10 smart phones to folks who cannot afford to spend 500 to 1200 Dollars for high end smart phones. I think the sweet spot price for a good Windows 10 mobile continuum capable smart phone is 300 to 400 USA dollars. in the USA buy a new or used Lumia Windows smart phone as soon as you can because Cheap mid priced and low priced Microsoft Windows 10 mobile capable smart phones may be gone forever unless MS CEO Nadella has “Surface” low priced and mid priced smart phone also for sale by Microsoft johala02 Probably correct, the problem now it will be a big “gap” in the market for many months with basicly no new Windows Phones/Mobiles that will be launched. So the marketshare will dropping as times goes by. What developer will release new UWP apps if almost no mobiles or small tablets to use them in? Even if the Surface Phone in spring 2017 will be a top notch device. How will the Windows app store situation be? Even if Microsoft changing the looks in the app store it still struggles, they get some UWP app now and then, but many companies taking out apps in the same pace, like Amtrak and others. The only person in Microsoft with some passion for Windows Phone probably was Joe Belfiore. According to some rumours his one year vacation was a result of internal problem with Terry Myerson. So I am not sure if their mobile strategy at all will involve a Surface phone. But time will tell. Jerry Can you please supply a link of what you’ve read… Laterz And no blu sky on the horizon. Donavan Fishel I intend to upgrade from my 1520 (sim tray got screwed, so I got to use it with wifi) to a Lumia 950XL. But with Microsoft staying mum about future mobile launches…. Well, i got to wait. damalyx i thought some fans (a slice of that .6%) actually liked tile UI i personally hate it because even MS’ own services like skype & xbox presented in a solid color like “here we have a unique homescreen unlike sea of icons on competing platfroms, you can make it transparent so your start screen will looks stylishly uniform! guess what? you can make it like competing platform with the smallest static tile and we ourselves aren’t interested to make our services looks that stylishly uniform lol” Victor I never had any problems with my latest android phones. Cant even remember when it crashed last time. My iPad crashes very often tho. Programmatic410 Maybe a short reply, though at least it gives me reason to write about this topic I like, while having my morning coffee. 🙂 Touchscreen wireless tablet monitors (with pen support) that remotely display from another main system are definitely going to happen, and considering what x86 driver support alone allows, besides all the x86 software support, it is practically guaranteed that Continuum devices will be x86 ASAP (I expect it within 2 years). Lenovo already released a wireless touchscreen in 20122013 (only supported pen wired), called the ThinkVision LT1423. Wireless USB drivers were recently reported as included in Redstone 2. Besides that, it makes perfect sense that people would want less expensive touchscreens that wirelessly use the full power of their Windows 10 desktops, that already run touchscreen UWP apps, so that they can have full access to their main system, without having to configure multiple Windows installations. Maybe most future tablets will come standard with the ability to either boot to a local OS or boot to “wireless touchscreen display mode”. As to whether or not that feature becomes mainstream, I suppose it depends on wireless display standards and how battery life compares, though it should be better, even if just using existing technology, such as what would basically be a wireless tablet zero client with RDP support. A quick web search shows that zero clients can use 150th of the power of a full client, though I don’t expect that in this case, because these would still be powering the touchscreen and wireless. Also, if the tablet touchscreen device doesn’t run a full OS, there is a lot more room for battery, without extra weight, or it can be lighter, with the same sized battery that still may get longer battery life than if it was running full Windows. As for the wearable x86 Windows computer idea, it will happen; the question is whether or not it will be mainstream. For one, that form factor could be much better than integrating WindowsWindows Holographic capable hardware into the head gear of VRAR, since less weight on your head is best, plus then that device can be used for other applications, such as without head gear and just using wireless touchscreenslap docks, that are certainly going to exist. NVIDIA’s latest mobile chips may be technically possible to fit in a reasonably sized wearable computer today, with enough power to do VR and potentially with enough battery life for a reasonably long VR gaming session, especially since such a device could be easily expanded with USB batteries that fit in your pocket. The HP Lap Dock already supports connecting to it wirelessly, though it currently has a bit laggy Miracast implementation to do it. If you want a better idea of how well it will eventually work, remote into Windows 10 Pro from Windows 10 RDP over WiFi to test performance (keeping in mind that future and better standardized wireless displays, especially at short range for wearable computers, should work even better)… it is currently quite good with low latency, and even the latest Windows 10 RDP does not display as fast as what Microsoft has done with Xbox streaming (you should see OK windowed playback of video with RDP, though video, especially full screen video, works much better with Xbox streaming than RDP currently does), so I expect even better performance will come in a future version of Windows, just as RDP has improved dramatically in consumer Windows since XP, even the difference between Windows 7 and 10 RDP is tremendously better for full screen refreshes and video. There is going to be a huge amount of research and development continu(um)ing in remotewireless display, for a lot of reasons besides gaming, plus 4K wireless has existed for years, and although I haven’t tried it, I expect it will improve and eventually be possible from wearable computers. Orc Yes the impressed Android users, I’ve meet all 3. Orc So that’s how we judge how good Android is, on the amount of times it crashes. A great OS indeed. Orc Android runs amazing for a couple of months then the users ask me for help. Orc You really don’t know how Google gets its money do you… Victor So what do you mean with Android not running well? For me it works flawlessly. Apps talk to eachother so I don’t need to go around things like ios. Victor It’s not androids fault the users is stupid :p gwine So the title is just click bait? praxius If Blu actually put out a decent, unique phone with W10M on it, I would have been interested, however all they released were low / mid range phones back in the 8.1 days and those phones didn’t have a smooth upgrade to 10 if I remember correctly. There were already a number of better Windows Phones available in the category Blu’s phone fit into. Because of this, It’s no surprise if they haul out. A catchy shell is nice but you can’t expect great sales with just that and by slapping the WP8.1 OS + modest specs inside. You need something that stands out. They didn’t have that. undude MSFT doesn’t have a mobile phone strategy. It has a pocket-pc sized computer strategy. This new category of smaller device that msft is creating is just another Windows device, and so the OS doesn’t need to be specifically”mobile device” friendly. Hence all that was in 8.1 and prior versions that provided “mobile” friendly experiences is no longer needed. This is the state of things now. So, it’s the PC makers that are most likely to experiment with new pocket-pc sized continuum enabled computers. Pity. I wonder how many remaining Windows Phone users will jump to a Nokia branded android phone if it’s made with some quality built in and with a great camera experience. Andy If this is true then i guess they made a good decision as the adoption of windows 10 mobile will only lead to a loss for them. Orc Maybe you should get a life instead, or even better a girlfriend. Orc The more apps you install on Android the worse performance it gets. On top of that the OEMs own software is on the device that makes it performance even worse. Also add that it comes with Googles apps preinstalled. Orc Well its certainly not fun now. Alf Lenni Erlandsen Going strong!? Ha ha. Made me laugh! Victor I always buy phones with almost stock Android like Sony and One plus. And never had these problems. So it must ba a problem with the heavier Android skins the OEM:s put on. When it comes to pre installed Google apps, it’s the same with Windows phones comes with pre installed Microsoft apps, and iPhones with Apple apps. Orc Yes and I don’t want to use google services. So I avoid android and is happy about it. Denny Varghese IS THIS THE TIME TO SUPPORT IOS/ANDROID APPS surur So you don’t think its a meaningful change? That you go to a company’s website there is no mention of their Windows Mobile range? R.F YOU FAKE R.F YOU FAKE. donzebe Just keep laughing, Windows phones are growing strong.

The investment in Pittsburg-based Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber UBER.UL, will make Ford the company's largest shareholder. Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said the investment is in line with previous announcements on planned capital expenditures. Argo AI, which focuses on artificial intelligence and robotics, will help build what Ford calls its "virtual driver system" at the heart of the fully autonomous car Ford said last year it would develop by 2021. "With Argo AI’s agility and Ford's scale we're combining the benefits of a technology start up with the experience and discipline we have at Ford," Fields said at a press conference. Once the technology is fully developed for Ford, it could be licensed to other companies, executives said. While Ford will retain a majority of the start-up's equity, the potential for an equity stake as Argo AI hires 200 more employees will be an advantage in recruiting talent, executives said. "They have the opportunity to run it pretty independently with a board, but because it is a separate company or subsidiary, it has the opportunity to go out and recruit with competitive compensation packages and equity," Fields said. Until now, Ford's investments in future transportation technology have been relatively modest, compared with those of General Motors Co  and others. One of Ford’s largest such investments in the past year was $75 million to buy a minority stake in Velodyne, a manufacturer of laser-based lidar sensing systems for self-driving cars. Rival GM made a billion-dollar bet a year ago with its acquisition of Silicon Valley self-driving startup Cruise Automation. GM also invested $500 million to buy a 9-percent stake in San Francisco-based ride services firm Lyft, a competitor to Uber.

The two leaders at a press conference released the commitments which include major promises made by the two parties to the people of the state in their manifestos. The list of commitments include distribution of free smartphones to youth, employment guarantee through skill development to 20 lakh youth, loan waiver to farmers, cheap power and proper remuneration for crops. It also committed to provide Rs 1,000 monthly pension to one crore poor families and one-time food at Rs 10 to urban poor, 33 per cent reservation to women in government jobs and 50 per cent reservation in panchayat and local bodies elections besides power, road and water to every village in five years. Free cycles to all girl students of class IX to XII and meritorious students, free homes to over 10 lakh poor dalit and backward families, four-lane roads connecting all districts and metro in six main cities also figure in the list. For the minorities and backwards, it has promised representation in ratio to their population in all the welfare schemes as also police modernisation for making it more effective and phased expansion of dial-100 scheme. These commitments include the promises made by Rahul Gandhi during his state-wide Kisan Yatra, such as loan waiver to farmers and reduction of power tariff for them — a long-time demand of Congress. “At least Samajwadi people practically give shape to what they say but some others only do ‘mann ki baat’ but ‘kaam ki baat nahi karte’.. they do not say in rallies and in districts what are the achievements of their government,” Akhilesh said. “(They say) two families have entered into an alliance... I will say that two youth have come together it is an the alliance of SP and Congress...,” he stressed in response to a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s comment in this regard. “These are ten steps to development worked out by the two parties on which Congress and SP will work on coming to power in future,” Akhilesh added.

Bangladesh Cricket One-Off Test Match Start Time, Preview Sports 2 0 0 February 8, 2017 Live Stream: India Vs. Bangladesh Cricket One-Off Test Match Start Time, Preview Jonathan Vankin The India cricket team looks to stretch their record-setting unbeaten streak to 19 test matches as they host Bangladesh for the first time, and cricket fans who want to watch a live stream of the historic match, as the Tigers visit for the single, one-off test in Hyderabad starting on Thursday, can find full streaming information below for both competing nations as well as the United Kingdom, United States, and the Middle East. Bangladesh has faced India in Tests eight times since winning full status from the ICC in 2000. But the Tigers have never beaten India, managing only two draws with six defeats. All of the previous eight Bangladesh vs. India test matches have taken place on the Tigers’ home turf. They hope that taking their game on the road will lead to a change of fortunes — but Bangladesh will again have to make due without star pacer Mustafizur Rahman. “The Fizz” makes his return to Hyderabad where he became a local hero last year by leading the Indian Premier League’s Sunrisers franchise to their first IPL championship. Bangladesh will visit India without pacer Mustafizur Rahman, who was left out due to a lack of “mental fitness.” [Image By A.M. Ahad/AP Images] But Mustafizur has been ruled out of the one-off Test in India due to “lack of mental fitness.” After missing six months with a shoulder injury, Mustafizur returned to the Bangladesh squad for a New Zealand tour late last year — a tour in which the Tigers lost all eight matches across three formats, including a two-match test series. But the now 21-year-old bowler who burst on the world scene as a teenage sensation in 2015 is reportedly struggling to regain his earlier pace, and his performance in the New Zealand series was disappointing. Bangladesh will take on India in the match scheduled for five days without their young star, starting at 9:30 a.m. India Standard Time on Thursday, February 9, at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal, Hyderabad. On Bangladesh Standard Time, the match will get underway will at 10 a.m. In the United Kingdom, the live stream begins at 4:00 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time, while in the United States the match is scheduled to begin at 11 p.m. on Wednesday, February 8, Eastern Time, or 8 p.m. Pacific Time.

India Coach Anil Kumble said he anticipated an “interesting contest,” despite India’s dominance of their neighbors to the northeast over the years. “Bangladesh is a very improved side now. They have had a good outing in New Zealand, although the results were different. But Bangladesh going to New Zealand and doing what they did, we certainly respect the opposition,” the India spinning great said at a Tuesday press conference. The last time the two teams squared off in a test cricket match, Bangladesh managed a rain-shortened draw in June of 2015. [Featured Image By A.M.

Listen to elevators talk Elizabeth Weise , USATODAY 4:15 p.m. ET Feb. 10, 2017 628 Shares A screen shot from a website provided by the Finnish elevator company Kone, of its elevator in Illinois talking to it via the cloud.  (Photo: Kone) SAN FRANCISCO — There's paint drying and then there's listening to elevators talk, both calming and now both available online. This week the Finnish elevator company Kone launched a website showing four of its elevators around the world talking to the cloud. It's a way for the company to show customers exactly what its Internet-connected elevators are doing. "Our marketing people wondered if anyone had ever seen how machines really talk. So we decided to show it," said Kone president and CEO Henrik Ehrnrooth. The real-time page shows four elevators communicating with Kone's cloud-based network that feeds into IBM's Watson platform. There's also an audio function that allows visitors to listen to the conversation. The messages are translated into English from machine data, Ehrnrooth said. So what exactly does that look like? On Friday at 11:35 am, the elevator in Illinois told Kone's main computer that it was experiencing "minimal sway while starting my way down." The Kone network replied, "Negligible sway. Keep going." A minute later the elevator reported, "Slight vibration on my way down," to which the Kone network answered, "That was actually really smooth." A graphic showing the data available from a Kone elevator.  (Photo: Kone) The elevator is sending real-time data from its sensors and controls about how it's functioning to the cloud, where Kone collects all the information and then uses IBM's Watson Internet of Things platform to sift through for issues. "We might see that the doors are closing a little more slowly on a certain elevator, and that could mean that there's a problem with the door motor or maybe some gravel is preventing it from closing fully,"  Ehrenrooth told USA TODAY. Watson analyzes the data to look for patterns and see if anything's out of normal. "If it sees that the door slowness is ongoing, it would send out a technician with the right parts to fix the problem, before it's actually a problem," he said. The elevators are in Illinois, Stockholm, Sweden, Delft in the Netherlands and Espoo, Finland. The company doesn't give their exact location to maintain privacy. A schematic of Kone elevator showing the data collected from it.  (Photo: Kone) The translation isn't actually a part of the data that's transmitted. For example, on Friday night in Illinois, the elevator reported that it was waiting on the first floor and that the temperature was 26.1° C (79 ° F). The translation for its eavesdropping public: "Patience is a virtue. Somebody will ride soon," the elevator replied. Kone wants users to know that there's no worry about anyone hacking into its elevators as the data flow is only outward. "You can't send information to them," the CEO said. USA TODAY Two Google Home speakers are chatting and it's the best thing ever The company has about 1,000 of these cloud-connected elevators around the world. They're especially popular in China, which is a growing market for the company. "We're thinking of adding an elevator in China to the page because right now when it's night in Europe and in the United States it's a bit boring. With China, there would always be elevators that were being used," Ehrenrooth said. Oh, and to see paint dry, just Google "Paint drying" and you'll find multiple options.

Thirteen years ago, during his confirmation hearing before taking over as federal judge in a district court in Seattle, Robart had exclaimed: “Working with people who have an immediate need and an immediate problem that you are able to help with is the most satisfying aspect of the practice of law”. On February 3, he was able to help thousands of people with an immediate need and an immediate problem. Immigrants and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim nations had been left stranded after newly-minted President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning them from setting foot on US soil--a measure he deemed necessary for national security. As airports started filling with travellers who learnt of their predicament mid-air and many more found themselves unable to even board flights to the US, Robart issued a temporary stay on the order and prohibited their deportation. “How many arrests have there been of foreign nationals from those seven countries since 9/11?” he asked US department of justice lawyer Michelle Bennett, who was representing the Trump administration during the hearing. When Bennett feigned ignorance, Robart himself replied: “None.” Advertisement opens in new window The sigh of relief was global in proportion. Not only did US security forces have to stop detentions and deportations and let immigrants in, but green card and visa holders from the seven countries—Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen—also started rushing back, unsure of how long the window of opportunity would last. Justice Robart isn’t alone. Ex-diplomats and officials argue that the ban actually threatens security by undermining the fight against terror. Before becoming a US federal judge, Rob­art spent nearly three decades in private practice—helping children’s homes manage their legal affairs and representing refugees in courts. Just last year, he had chided the police for excessive use of force against minorities and exclaimed in court that “Black lives matter”—the slogan of a popular grassroots movement against police brutality. It is, therefore, not surprising that he has blocked the president’s anti-immigration executive order. But Robart isn’t alone. Within weeks of taking over, Trump and his presidency are facing a concerted challenge as state administrations, federal and local courts, former officials, captains of industry and the angry half of a bitterly divided nation close ranks against him. Perhaps just as significantly, world leaders have stepped up and spoken out against his apparent undermining of international norms. Advertisement opens in new window Despite his populist appeal, Trump  hasn’t enjoyed the proverbial ‘honeymoon’ period that greets new presidents. Public protests began as soon as he was ele­cted in November, with streets across the US erupting with chants of ‘Not My President’. Americans rallied against the victory of a candidate widely seen as racist, xenophobic and misogynistic, who, it had emerged on his campaign trail, had bragged about assaulting women in the past and whose election promises prominently included a ban on Muslim entry into the US and a wall to fence out Mexico. His inauguration on January 20 witnessed a Women’s March to Washington DC, joined by hundreds of thousands. A week later, when Trump issued the order barring the citizens of seven nations from entering the US for 90 days and putting Syrian refugee admissions on hold indefinitely, people again joined in protest—many of them at airports. Robart’s stay on the order has been supported by federal judges in New York and Boston. In addition, a number of lower courts have blocked different parts of the order. But the legal drama is just starting to unfold. The issue is now being heard in an appeals court in San Francisco. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have filed briefs in the court, arguing that the immigration ban “unleashed chaos” and—if allowed to go into effect—would harm state institutions, public universities and the economy. They contend that the executive order is unconstitutional, the pre­text of national security is a “sham” and the ban is intended to discriminate against Muslims, as evident from many of Trump’s own statements on the subject. Advertisement opens in new window President Trump has hit back in a manner he knows best. In a tweet, he berated Robart’s ruling as “ridiculous” and called him a “so-called judge”. The justice depar­tment has also filed its brief in the appe­als court, claiming that the president has broad powers to issue such orders in the interests of national security and that courts should not second-guess his intentions. After all, this isn’t the first time a US president is issuing such orders. The Trump team cites eight previous instances, dating back to Ronald Reagan’s order in 1986 to restrict the entry of residents from Cuba, Libya, Russia, Somalia and Yemen. Most recently, President Barack Obama prohibited the processing of refugee requests from Iraq for six months in 2011—and did not disclose the policy for nearly two years. Irrespective of how the appeals court rules, the matter will almost certainly end up in the supreme court. Advertisement opens in new window A recalcitrant judiciary is hardly the president’s only worry. Several former diplomatic, intelligence and security officials, including secretaries of state John Kerry and Madeline Albright, have also filed a declaration against the ban. They argue that the ban in fact threatens national sec­urity by undermining counter-terrorism and law enforcement efforts and putting the lives of US troops and intelligence sources at risk. And senior members of Trump’s own Republican Party, such as senators John McCain and Lindsay Graham, said the ban would help the Islamic State and other militant groups recruit more easily by fomenting hatred. Nearly 100 technology enterprises—inc­luding blue-chip companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple—have urged the courts to overturn the ban to pro­­tect the “competitiveness of US compa­nies”. Other businesses have also publicly come out against the ban. Starbucks, for instance, declared it would hire 10,000 ref­ugees worldwide. Many others have exp­ressed support for their foreign employees. Trump’s election and inauguration also sent temperatures rising outside American shores. A petition to block his upcoming state visit to Britain has gathered over a million signatures. On February 6, speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, cited parliament’s anti-racism/sexism sta­nce and said Trump shouldn’t be allowed to address MPs on his visit. Advertisement opens in new window Since he issued the Muslim ban, a number of world leaders—including some of America’s closest allies—have become publicly critical. Hours after meeting Trump in the White House, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that “we do not agree with this kind of approach”. Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of next-door Canada, tweeted that refugees were welcome in his country. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reminded Trump about America’s responsibility towards refugees under the Geneva Conventions. If these early days are any indication, Pre­sident Trump faces some extremely challenging years ahead in office. He did not issue the immigration ban out of a genuine fear for national security—as is apparent from the countries on the list—but to begin implementing the racist and xenophobic agenda he promised at the hustings. That is also the reason why everyone, from judges and lawyers to current and former officials, business leaders and even international allies, have ranged against him so quickly. They realise this is just the beg­inning—that if left unchallenged, Trump would move to implement a plethora of other campaign vows, including blanket bans on Muslim immigration, a registry for Muslims in the country, the wall on the Mexican border and so on. He would also renegotiate regional and global free trade agreements the US is party to and security commitments to Nato allies, as promised.

He has found out that the waters are a little too deep, and perhaps a little too hot, for comfort.

Both Sasikala and Panneerselvam met him, with the former handing the Governor letters of support given by her party legislators.Panneerselvam had a 5 minutes one on one meeting with the governor and asked to be given five days to prove majority in the House. He also said that 130 MLAs were supporting him and that Sasikala's claims of a majority were dubious. According to AIADMK statement issued late in the night, Sasikala handed over the documents electing her as the leader of the legislature party. But the AIADMK statement was strangely silent on the number of legislators supporting her. India Today UP Assembly polls: Political slugfest intensifies ahead of elections Leading parties - BJP, BSP, Congress, Samajwadi and RLD kept the caste and religious equations in mind during their campaigns, which even extended up to the selection of candidates and star campaigners. BSP supremo Mayawati was primarily focusing on Dalit, Muslim and Brahmin votes, so she deployed her trusted advisors Naseemuddin Siddiqui and Satish Mishra in regions dominated by them. Samajwadi Party president and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav joined hands with Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi and kept his focus around the development work carried out by his government and on the Centre's shortcomings. A total of 15 districts and 73 Assembly seats of Uttar Pradesh would vote in the first phase of elections.

But the Wet Hot American Summer shoot has become so legendary and is so well-documented at this point (in articles like this one!) that I should’ve been more eager to watch the process that went into making one of my favorite movies. For those outside the cult of Camp Firewood, Hurricane Of Fun’s main draw is the chance to watch pre-fame comedy babies goofing around totally unaware that they’re making the best film comedy of the 21st century. But for the faithful, it’s an invaluable document, a video yearbook showing off the genuine bond/trench mentality that formed between cast and crew as they fought through 20-some days of rain and inhospitable temperatures to make a beautifully bonkers movie set on the last day of summer. You’ll feel closer than ever to Amy Poehler while you watch her hop around to Le Tigre’s “Deceptacon” (while A.D. Miles stands in the foreground, wearing three wigs); you’ll “aww” at the title card that describes Bradley Cooper skipping his Actor’s Studio graduation ceremony to film his sex scene with Michael Ian Black. And even a jaded soul like I will feel the magic of moviemaking all over again, during the legitimately suspenseful sequence that depicts the film’s big van-crash gag. In the final cut, it’s a few seconds of vehicular slapstick, but in Hurricane Of Fun, it demonstrates why everyone involved is still talking about making Wet Hot (and going back to Camp Firewood, and then going back again) 16 years later. [Erik Adams] Worldwide radio When I was young, I was a ham- and shortwave-radio nerd. There was something thrilling about hiding under my blanket at night and listening in on conversations half a world away. These days, we take for granted just how astounding it is to listen to live radio from anywhere in the world. It wasn’t until I encountered Radio.garden that my sense of amazement was restored. Essentially it’s TuneIn Radio meets Google Earth, and what makes the interface especially neat is how you can switch from a Brazil samba channel to Korean talk radio with a swipe of the onscreen globe. The interstitial static makes it all the more realistic and intimate. I can’t stop playing around on this site. [Kevin Pang] Transformers: More Than Meets The Eye Image: IDW Publishing, Alex Milne As much as I love all things Transformers (even the Michael Bay movies), Transformers comics never appealed to me. I recently read through the entirety of James Roberts and Alex Milne’s Transformers: More Than Meets The Eye run, though, and it just might be the best story ever told with any incarnation of these characters. Set in the aftermath of the Autobot/Decepticon war, the book sees a ragtag group of robots leaving their home planet on a quest to find some mythological figures. However, the mission itself often takes a backseat to the characters’ many psychological issues and their propensity for weird pop culture riffs (they watch Community off-panel in one issue). Also, there are a number of unexpectedly touching stories about romantic relationships, which are surprisingly and effortlessly progressive due to the fact that the vast majority of Transformers characters identify as male—a level of inclusivity that you wouldn’t expect in most comics, let alone a comic about toys. At its core, More Than Meets The Eye is about accepting people for who they are, which is a lot more interesting than robots who are simply at war with other robots.

Gadgets 0 0 0 February 8, 2017 Oculus Rift Demo Stations Close At Best Buy: Is VR Going The Same Route As 3D? Daryl Deino The Oculus Rift was hailed as a groundbreaking device that could usher in a new technological era. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to be happening. Even though most people who have tried the Rift and other VR headsets have been pretty much blown away, VR doesn’t seem to be catching on to the average consumer. According to Business Insider, the Rift stations are closing down at Best Buy. “Facebook is closing around 200 of its 500 Oculus virtual reality demo stations at Best Buy locations across the US, Business Insider has learned.” Customers haven’t showed a lot of interest in the new Oculus Rift. [Image by Christian Petersen/Getty Images] The article adds that the scaling back of the Oculus Rift demos comes after workers from several Best Buys indicated that it was common for them to go days without giving a single demonstration. However, Oculus spokeswoman Andrea Schubert said the closings were due to “seasonal changes.” “We’re making some seasonal changes and prioritizing demos at hundreds of Best Buy locations in larger markets. You can still request Rift demos at hundreds of Best Buy stores in the US and Canada.,” Schubert is quoted as saying. This certainly isn’t the nail in the coffin for virtual reality, but it is a slight setback. When the Oculus Rift officially went on sale in March, reviews were mixed. The New York Times says the Oculus Rift is a clunky portal to a promising virtual reality. “I can report that while the Rift is a well-built hardware system brimming with potential, the first wave of apps and games available for it narrows the device’s likely users to hard-core gamers. It is also rougher to set up and get accustomed to than products like smartphones and tablets.” Geoffrey A. Fowler from The Wall Street Journal believed that the Oculus Rift just wasn’t ready for the mainstream upon its release. “The Rift demonstrates flashes of a brilliant future where we can move freely through countless virtual worlds. But even after I fixed the sensor glitch, a week with the Rift showed me it still needs to dig itself out of some deep holes,” Fowler said, adding that the Rift is the type of product you wanted to try, but not really own unless you are a serious gamer. Part of the problem is that the Oculus Rift is an expensive investment. Right now, a Rift with a compatible PC costs about $1,400. Then, you have to pay $200 if you want the Oculus Touch controllers, which many see as essential for an immersive experience. “Oculus Touch, however, brings the Facebook-owned Oculus and its Rift at least one step closer to the virtual reality game-changer we’ve all been crowing about. Released as an optional accessory for the Rift headset, the twin controllers are about as far from optional as an accessory can get,” claimed Ben Silverman from Yahoo Tech. Samsung has found success with it’s mobile VR headset. [Image by Daryl Deino] Perhaps mobile VR is where the technology will take off. Samsung has been successful with the Gear VR, a lighter mobile version of the Rift that uses the Galaxy Note or Galaxy S device as a screen. While the developer’s edition that came out in December of 2014 received mixed reviews, the most recent consumer edition, released in August of 2016, received great reviews. Google has also been trying to promote VR with its Daydream View headset that works with the Google Pixel or the Pixel XL. The device has been praised for its hardware, but it has also been criticized for not offering many software titles to take advantage of the hardware. Where do you think VR is going? Do you think it will eventually take off, or will it become obsolete like 3D television sets? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.

Opponents gathered more than 2,500 signatures for a petition aimed at changing where the event would be held — a move they say Dana-Farber has had ample time to make after Trump announced plans for a similar ban on the campaign trail in December 2015. “They’ve had well over a year to reconsider this option,” Karandinos said. At least 500 people have said they will attend the rally, either via Facebook or Google Form RSVPs. In a press release Thursday, Dana-Farber said the fundraiser has not been moved because a last-minute switch could have been seen as a “political statement.” The release stressed the institute’s goal is to “stay out of politics.” “Cancer affects everyone,” the release read, “and we are a non-partisan, nonprofit health care institution.” But Karandinos argued the decision not to move the event itself is political. “Continuing to hold the fundraiser at what he calls the ‘winter White House’ is in fact a political statement,” he said. Dana-Farber said it will, in the future, “avoid controversial venues that may distract from our focus on cancer care and research.” Share this Article Join the Conversation Top Business Stories business & markets Sears may sell land, cut jobs to save $1B; shares soar associated press technology Uber sued for exposing husband's infidelity associated press technology Relax: Your Amazon Echo isn't recording everything you say janko roettgers business & markets L.L.

With President Trump moving to curb immigration and the U.S. tech industry in open revolt, the friendly, functional Canadian city may finally get its wish. Tech companies that keep satellite offices in Vancouver, just a two-hour flight from San Francisco, are exploring whether to move more jobs over the border. Immigration lawyers are reporting a steep uptick in inquiries. And a new start-up is offering to smooth the way, for $6,000 a person, for foreign-born tech workers worried their U.S. visas may disappear. "The global implications are dire," said Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson of the unrest in the United States. "But it may result in more workers coming to Vancouver to be part of the boom here in a city that welcomes immigrants with open arms." Vancouver is not the only foreign city part of these conversations. Portuguese officials in Lisbon created a fast track for Indian entrepreneurs last month. Intercom, an Irish technology start-up, offered to pay the legal costs of developers who had been impacted by Trump's immigration policies if they would move to Ireland. Tech executives say their first choice remains overturning or softening Trump's temporary ban on travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries as well as a reported plan to cut back the numbers of new work visas. But there is an open search for other options as companies long reliant on highly skilled foreigners move to protect their access to those workers. In interviews, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists said it was ironic that a business-friendly president would inflict damage on one of the nation's most lucrative industries. "If you're a technologist, then San Francisco right now is Florence in the Renaissance," said Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, a tech company with 400 employees, mostly in San Francisco. "Unfortunately, if we make it harder to bring the best employees here, that runs the risk of changing the center of gravity. And I don't think that's in the best interests of this country." For the talent-obsessed Silicon Valley, where an estimated one-third of the workforce is foreign-born and people are acutely aware of the fleeting nature of the success, these are much-feared outcomes. In a coordinated move opposing the ban, about 100 technology companies, including Google, Facebook, Netflix and Apple, argued in a legal filing Sunday night that restricting immigration damages U.S. competitiveness. "Instability and uncertainty" caused by the executive orders "will make it far more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to hire some of the world's best talent - and impede them from competing in the global marketplace," the companies wrote. Yan-David Erlich, chief executive of Parsable, a 30-person start-up, was on a trip to Mexico with several colleagues last month when Trump announced his travel ban, which has since been tied up in legal challenges. Erlich — an immigrant from France, where his parents moved after fleeing the Holocaust — said he felt like the United States had changed during the few days he was away. One-third of his workforce is comprised of immigrants, and to make matters worse, two workers were carefully questioned at the airport upon their return from Mexico. One of the few bright spots, Erlich said, was that Parsable already had an office in Vancouver and could easily expand it. "We didn't create that office as a backup plan," said Erlich, 38, adding that he opened it last year to bypass a slow and burdensome U.S. visa process. "We wanted to access worldwide talent, and frankly that is easier to do in Canada than in the U.S. But now we have U.S.-based employees who see it as a safe haven." Vancouver, which already has 75,000 tech jobs and one-third of its office space devoted to the industry, has certain unmistakable advantages: It shares a time zone, a similar culture and easy travel links to U.S. tech hubs, with Seattle less than 150 miles away. Vancouver also offers access to skiing, hiking and boating - a combination popular with tech workers in the San Francisco Bay Area and Pacific Northwest. But Vancouver also has drawbacks: Housing is even more expensive than San Francisco. The Canadian city also lacks a sizable ecosystem of venture capitalists that entrepreneurs rely on to back their ideas. Canadian entrepreneur Michael Tippett teamed up with Silicon Valley venture capitalists to launch True North Ventures, a program to help Bay Area immigrants relocate to Canada. The company will fly high-skilled visa holders to Canada for an exploratory trip and meetings with local immigration lawyers, Tippett said. He also will help Silicon Valley companies set up Vancouver subsidiaries to which they can transfer employees. Since announcing the initiative last week, which was in the works prior to the announcement of Trump's travel ban, Tippett said he has fielded more than 100 calls from Silicon Valley workers on temporary H1-B work visas and from the companies that rely on them. "The Trump administration says it is pro-business, but it's our business that will benefit," Tippett said. "This is Vancouver first!" Richard Kurland, a Vancouver immigration lawyer, said he has fielded dozens of calls and emails from potential immigrants since the announcement of Trump's travel ban. "These are people voting with their feet," he said. Some immigrant entrepreneurs said they were agonizing over the decision to make a Canada move. Baback Elmieh, 42, a serial entrepreneur and Iranian immigrant who, in the past decade, sold tech companies he founded to Google and Facebook, said he would hesitate to start another company in the United States and is considering moving to Vancouver. As a legal permanent U.S. resident — but not a citizen — Elmieh has lived in Silicon Valley since he was 24 and has a 6-year-old daughter there. His parents, who also were born in Iran but now live in Canada, were forced to cancel a scheduled visit because Trump's temporary travel ban prevented them from boarding the flight. "It now feels like there are people on one side of the line and people on the other," Elmieh said. "That makes it very uncertain for what we should do for our family and where I want my daughter to grow up."

Receiving poor treatment in a restaurant or buying a new product only to have it turn out defective can really sour your day. Fortunately, customers have more power than ever at our fingertips thanks to the internet. Here are 11 ways to get your voice heard and receive a higher level of customer service. 1. Research Awareness of the company’s refund policy and guarantee information makes it easier to find out what exactly you’re entitled to. Read the fine print before you make a purchase. For example, some stores only issue store credit and don’t provide refunds. Be familiar with the company’s guarantee and warranty policy. You may be entitled to a free replacement or repair services depending on the defect. 2. Be Empathetic Kill em’ with kindness. Dale Carnegie’s book, How To Win Friends and Influence People, stresses the importance of being able to see things from another person’s perspective. Try to get the salesperson to sympathize with your cause by treating them like a friend. Instead of lashing out try saying : ”I realize that it isn’t your fault but it’s disappointing to spend $200 on this purse and have the seams fall apart. I was hoping if you could give me a refund or at least store credit?” 3.Be Specific Specifying exactly what you want makes it easier for the business to make it up to you. Some customers get angry and rant and rave without telling the person on the other end how they can make things better. Don’t be that person. Do you want a discount? A refund? An apology? Be clear and specific when stating your demands. 4. Contact Customer Service If you’re unable to resolve the issue in person, you may want to contact the company’s 1-800 number. Directories like Dial A Human, Flaptor and Yellow Pages make it easy to obtain contact information for any business. You can increase your chances of getting to a live person by dialing “0.” If that doesn’t work, try to connect with the sales, billing or tech departments, which are more likely to be staffed. Once you get through, ask them to transfer you to the department you really want. Once you do get a live rep on the line, you have the option of escalating the call further by asking to speak to a supervisor. If that doesn’t work you can escalate it even further up the chain of command. Managers and executives have the power to make decisions that customer service reps don’t. 5. The Power Of The Chargeback If there’s one thing businesses despise it’s chargebacks. This is when a consumer contacts their credit card company in order to reverse charges and get their funds back. Reasons for a chargeback may include receiving substandard service or being charged without receiving what you ordered. It’s ultimately up to your credit card’s issuing bank to determine if the chargeback is valid or not. 6. Harness The Power of Social Media Some large companies, such as Ford Motors, actually employ people to comb through social media for mentions of their brand with the purpose of resolving complaints. You can exercise your right to free speech by posting about your experience on Facebook and Twitter. You can also tweet to the offending company directly and mention their brand in a hashag. 7. Utilize The Company’s Online Community Many big companies like Verizon or Dell, have an online forum or community where members can register and engage with fellow customers. Companies are more likely to address concerns posted on a forum in a timely manner since it’s public. 8. Write An Online Review More customers than ever are reading online reviews before frequenting a new restaurant or business. Online review sites like Yelp, Google Places and Angie’s List are taken very seriously by business owners since even one negative review can severely impact their business. Businesses who have claimed their Yelp listing get notified immediately after every new review. Some businesses will also respond publicly to reviews. RipoffReport is another site that allows consumers to air grievances publicly. These complaints tend to rank high in the search engines when potential customers search for the company’s business name in Google. As a result, companies are more likely to respond in a timely manner in order to protect their reputation. 9. Write A Letter Write a letter detailing your experience and grievances and address it to the highest ranking individual at the company; this can be the CEO or owner. Make sure to include details such as the date and time of incident and the name of the employee you interacted with. Send the letter via certified mail in order to confirm receipt. If you send it via email you can use an e-mail tracking system which notifies you when the email has been opened. 10. Contact The Better Business Bureau What’s great about complaining to the Better Business Bureau is that they will contact the offending company on your behalf. If the company is a member of the Better Business Bureau they will have to respond. Companies that are members have to maintain certain standards in order to keep their membership active. Give Praise When It’s Due Acknowledge the company if they resolved the issue, especially if you made a complaint on social media or Yelp. No one is perfect and it’s fair to give a business a second chance if they’ve shown good faith in making things better. Featured photo credit: Pixabay via pixabay.com Love this article?

By Spiros Tsaltas Previous | Next  You might have read it almost all over the internet -and in several books- that you will need at least 10.000 hours of experience in learning a new skill in a new area of expertise. And unfortunately, people keep reading and repeating that hugely erroneous peace of misinformation. So, what is the truth? Allow me to explain, please. . The History behind the 10.000hrs Learning- Myth. In 1993, Professor Anders Ericsson, at the time a Professor at the University of Colorado, published an article called 'The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance'. That was a natural follow up of his book (written with Jacqui Smith): 'Toward a General Theory of Expertise' in 1991. He studied the research of a group of psychologists in Berlin, who had observed the violin practice habits of learners in their childhood, adolescence and adulthood years. They have found out that by the age of 20, the 'elite' violin players had statistically averaged more than 10.000 hours of practice each (the less able performers had only done an average of about 4.000 -5.000 hours of practice). Ericsson tried to test and extend that idea to all sorts of experts in various fields. So, he interviewed and studied top- athletes, technical professionals and other various top- performers in several fields. He concluded that "many characteristics once believed to reflect innate talent, are actually the result of intense practice extended for a minimum of 10 years". (it assumes that you have a maximum of 1.000 hrs annually to 'perfect' that given expertise). Fair enough, for a world-class top performing subject- matter expert. So far - so good. . How was the 10.000hrs- Myth created? Anders Ericsson talked in the early 90s about his research- results: that you need at least 10.000 hours to become a World-Class Expert in anything (less if you have a 'natural talent' in that field). Unfortunately, Malcolm Gladwell -a Journalist- wrote in 2008 a hugely popular book: 'Outliers' (if I recall correctly, it was for several weeks -if not months- on NY Times' Bestsellers List). In his book, Gladwell, he took out of context and introduced "the 10,000-hour rule" to his reading mass audience. In the book, the 10.000 hrs been the time needed to become a world expert/ top performer was misrepresented or misinterpreted as the time needed to learn a new skills. Sorry, but that is completely wrong - just a result of a journalist not understanding what he turned into 'popular science'. So, what is the truth? How much time do I need to learn something new? Ericsson been completely unhappy about how his findings were presented, wrote in 2012 an article (a scientific paper): 'The Danger of Delegating Education to Journalists'. No more comment on that - I hope it's clear to all. Studies point out that you need to spend between 20-50 hours (depending on complexity) to learn a new skill so you can have a clear understanding when you communicate with people in that field, develop a sort of 'gut-feeling' and obviously be familiar with all the relevant terminology. But you will need to spend the majority of these 20-50 hours also practicing what you read - it can't be just reading a book; no theory without practice please. If you are starting your own business, these 20-50 hrs should be a guideline for how much time for example you need to invest in building your marketing knowledge, so you can write the marketing section on your business plan, etc. Another example: learning to write Macros in Excel. Sure you can read all about it, and you need to practice it with a real data-filled Excel- spreadsheet. And in all reality, those 20-50 hours might be enough for what you want to do; it is very unlikely that you will need (unless your specialization requires it) 100- 200 hours to invest on learning Excel Macros. Please beware. There are new books (and relevant publicity on the internet) that you only need 20 hours to learn something; I would love to see the scientific data behind it, while I am still on this planet. . In Conclusion. There is a lot of information on how to effectively learn something new- just Google it; but there is an observation that seems to be valid: that the moment that you are able to correct yourself while practicing your new skill (e.g. correct your own mistakes in the Excel Macro example above), you are very close to 'command' that skill (not to be an expert). So, please stay with the 20-50 hours rule and why don't you 'MOOC yourself up' meanwhile? (MOOCs=Massive Open Online Courses; plenty of them are both high quality and free. Please Google Coursera or EdX or NovoEd or FutureLearn or OpenStudy or the African Management Institute, etc...). And like everything, if you going to acquire a new skill, you should plan how you will go about it - treat your learning process as a mini-project.

Op ride lot will join us that the 725 from NHL network in his perspective the jobs in the car next year WEEI hello John. KP so a couple Summers ago. When everyone was realizing that that's what wine make up for initial scenes you know they got rid of the groom this really know much fighting them. What it didn't. Can't merely said when dawn Sweeney rocket. Let's go get and I'll go for third round pick what would need at least squad Hough is that yes. That is a good question it is one of the dumbest trades. Dumbest jets that it really dumbest trade in Boston sports history and it's really it's. He was added nothing a third round pick wasted and act fake. Part remember correctly was the only player. Or one or very few ever suspected by the NHL. NBA HL at the same time. An unbelievable it's it's what 777 I'd seven under through seven Mikey he's he's a Dexter Oregon we guy Mike. It it is reflect in the lip and the oil and all the yet thanks Monica you do last night and I'm doing well. The talk to curricula Lleyton. If he's he's start. Against Claude Julian so I had to do not and I would say. That would go a little but I don't know if you have any executive experience but I'm ready to get a efficient passer out awkward. That replaced him nearly. Well I mean I can make better deals exactly although for a third round pick and Johnny boy chuck. It over to second round you go I think that came from ownership but not necessarily naturally so fall so I think a lot of stuff. Closed out ownership but times and we assume we are so home. That the GM and possibly the president might have to say that but sometimes a technical over the years particularly with this organization. Harry city included to get overruled by the owner I do think that happens. I I united I agree with that as well but you know what I think that you're dead on when you say that the one of the legal organizations speeches dark. And it would just go down. You know it is what it bottom out. It's embarrassing and I run the bottom out of what I'd rather the bottom out of them faking it. It held in trying to get a player. Did not go waste great. You don't trade creates it for nothing. And got to get a lot dot that you could get a lot form right now about the Daon and feel betrayed creature for nothing they can make. They still have a shot at the playoffs and you just look at the stating to you look at the games in hand. Some of these other teams it would it would Samie. It you know people wanna believe that this a kind of Joseph Morgan magic and Bruce cast to go ahead on a much in an MRI would be totally surprised this got losses team by the end of the season. I agree with it you know it in the had a couple port I wanted to make up an alcoholic like outages I lose my train of thought but you're you're absolutely right on the field where you know they make promotion days and also. He got. Purposes you know in baby was okay at that time it'll to the rink in nearly a credible. Operation for your irrationally right yup. But it you lead them in the in the position long enough he stop and think to himself but he's qualified enough to handle it really it all into it in over. I totally agree or not and he talked to people around the organization. And even some former players that live around here and I'm telling you they are stung quite frankly after 180 that can be used on from player but president busy always a way out of control way out of control because he was enabled by ownership. It put in this position and now. Talking to the press Tim is paid a. Exactly like you'll like you out a huge hit nearly the player. You know it is let his legacy is just on a crap don't belong in these days there in this city. Battling in the life for equality wanna do that if you have a quarter or. There were up on and you know Claude Julian obviously. App in the well connection and the did you use and into the fall guy he is without a doubt in my mind a top five or ten. Coach in this league top slide is that it didn't hit jackpot I hit it in the notorious. And they just over the years a move that would make it it I just don't think that big gear it towards is that. But you don't like immediately with its defense you want tickets defense oriented but the guy in Big Ten years viewers here a bit of her top fiber scoring what seven out of ten years leaders are also not to mention in the top three on defense so. I thought what a great balance here overwrought look at the numbers compare his tag you're here. Think that if I just think that reflects on his course ability because the players that they gave they brought they did. I don't think they track as it is right but he played you know he made. Oh what does it. London that he was given limiting their lemonade you know he I think he get the vessel what you get and then all of a and they prolong these. The new department I don't know what you said Howell thank god he's likely it'll. He's I think he's playing all the what was expected outlook. Because you're younger it. And I think that Tuesday and just not given the right people with pride in the system that you wanted to put that's my limit evidence that it blaming everything on and and and did use and a little flaw. At any edit and did you throw in the fact that they can't rest took rats to they can't win a game. I mean that's the more pressure on clos gonna still be under that pressure to play. Took out county if he's not injured in the next month I'll be stunned because they have to keep. Don't you know I want to you know I've. Outside north side I doubt that it got hockey that the goalie and you didn't admitted. India cricket and even the college level little own level they went out and out. It did did it the position so commitment. It's so demanded that YouTube you you have to give and somebody would you can take a Q did you know cops and that's all really what I'd like that the job development yet the. Thanks celeb might really appreciated 6177797. And 937. Many constituent a mixture on W I with the people I admitting. They're very. Under the car field and I wasn't as mindlessly at what I'll do with the snow on the cell sure. All of it I had a lot but I don't want to face up and it is a pleasure having you back on the VI had been missing a lot of guys my personal calling it and you'll pay what we feel pretty.

Which you'll want to try to get your voice to get on the radio. Well thank you say use me. You've got art and I'm talking about it if you bought time on WTI because one can talk people say they won't call god you know what. You are talking what we feel it couldn't tell you that okay talk about the Bruins public say that about Tuukka. So whom there is talk about on. You don't feel okay. These guys aren't and they just forget. Have a man we are. You think he's gone downhill this year because if he wasn't playing as many games he did the would be a last place in the Eastern Conference. It's that while I'm on the same guy to get the money in the market in the middle bigfoot they can for that are important you know. And I guess that would be good joy and the flight and gold okay initiated it if it's sad for them to treat the coach that brought you got. It does okay. Jewel and thinking that it will not result. Corset Africa and hurt the popular forget exactly the whole year hurt that whole year hurt it's it's Red Sox and Bruins. The Aqua. And then Korea it would block also called it that final play and we ought to be good enabled. Do you owed more cold. Like this you don't. We keep well. Talk about abroad because you don't want what did I do nearly like it could also nearly Graham like Woodley but this one that this might be yet okay. Wendy let him go I had wished I had won it only got like what it would create and I'm driving from certain that the Montreal all the sudden idea. They traded saying you know like a kid and that would be again. If so whitlock all backcourt and we locked into until the broad losses softness. I don't wanna play that bit about space talking they want a little bit about the present and all that. Antonio talk this what we knew when we come out gold and we'll talk about and wouldn't give you nice check. I think white people go back and. That help may expert called kind words that there's a lot of there's a lot of toughest issues with this team again again last night. That they played well less than a month to take away from there's still a few things they did last night that I was not in fan of I told you particularly a bunch ice into the second period. They were five or six of them there were torn over in the offense and its own into the commercials old again sable craps table mistakes and an NLD David there was that they looked they looked crisper passing I like the shot selection that stuff absolutely one game. Jamal the other boys want I'm just wondering if they can sustain that. The rest of the way here and starting tomorrow afternoon. The by the Vancouver can lock but I really really worry about Tuukka rusk and now I know bill opens up here now and who knows. Along is that that's gonna last and go to change lines a role bit which is what you expect with a new coach comes on board. But I really really wonder. No one game does not a season make as they say that's all we're say I still have some major major concerns. 6177797. Under through seven ralphs and credits of up next here on WIP hello Ralph. This is a lot of attention it got it was these are but I've always been a heap of it I needed you we're not sure I'd learned. Can you guys are. Where people look at you as a Jewish vote so. Well I mean I don't I don't relish a better person probably know it it really pains me to talk about the brewers this way but warm introduced to their fake it. I mean today I mean this is this has been going on for way too long and it is now it's. So that there's only so much that people who work at NASA could say I get that it's just the way it is that it's only can only say so much. You know what unified nation or for one of the. Immediately. Connolly that not and that is being beaten a lot of them look like vehicle. They don't doubt false start sure wherever it is not a thought I would report back it's nine years. Didn't seem to be reacting but you know I'd look check. Credits and yeah I know the Ireland is it. Is sitting that'll need to apply. It needs somehow but if Putin meet some horrible decision flush you're. I will they play music or where you whether he's so we know army. We know how you structure that that this guy merely to be is that that it should should regard this scene. Well and it may or may be you know what at Jeremy Jacobs a Smart I agree if you wouldn't be talking with with Brian Lawton you O'Brien is at the bottom of the hour at 75. Yeah yeah. I doubt at all but also a great guy to have Bob because you know there was interpret player. He was. He was an agent and he was a GM with the attempt Bailey now is endless on NHL network so. He gets it and Garth snow is the GM and other multi guy over at the islanders now and grow into place. And it all I know waits to one though and a pretty good job so far with the islanders but you know I'm more I'm wondering when ask you about ego is close to get picked up or doesn't wanna get picked up. You go before the end of the season but the out of the Republicans right on the precipice of make the playoffs and had like four games in the hands of the browns. Pete I'd go back in America and so I retrieve it cycle back to the greatest sport for that. I remember as a manageable fourth hole or just in most of us that. And I what's uncertain or they can't keep your eye sore back by if you work with overs to fuel every one of which. I'm really tight which Anderson now. They're exit. Great guy picture prince's people still look great and I sort of best of hockey it's got to look at it either edit and whether the numbers that opener of the equipment that will be. Or is. He changed the economy. And that is a separate. Rinks built over at people how to make you richer and tennis that was the most amazing. To me he's the greatest that was Boston will servicer. All right Ralph thanks again for the kind words referenda really appreciated. From. Approaches things yeah there that I exist I don't think anything to people are gonna agree on anything I I perspective I have acknowledged structures and accountability. Things it does it close certainly as a coach brings to the table and I think every team needs. And but at times theirs. Where you are any given situation to be able to implement a particular player and one that's having the patience of the younger player and such there were some times that you. When might not necessarily agreed upon things. But his count as you're not gonna trump decisions you know my lineups employs. There's a coach. You know they would like to say well maybe there's better personally confirm. It must grow that there may just waiting. On Tuesday night thorough being out of the drives of the director Camellia nowhere to be found just. Just three. Answering for decisions that probably in my opinion we're not his overall. Sure had to say it but. Just the way the entire thing was handled Kim nearly blaming everybody but Santa Claus were. What happened and the timing and it was the PR people and there's some blob blob of block. So transparent. And fake six point 77797937617779. A seven under through several check it would prime wandered just a little bit back to falls go to Brian in Bellingham a mix your WEEI Brian. I appeared I know you got to remember the first episode I the BP premiere episode. I I think so repressed memories I watched it a lot of them that was a few years ago opened separate lab operation destroy I would say. A lot that bet big on outlet the red are at the expo. Seat they act as if these are. They attacked the iron Belo they can't wait a lot about but they can't wait. Are bright field illusion your phone but they're called back writers have been renewed luster nudity so bad so there but there's been a history here of the Boston Bruins for the way they've handled. Up passed a firings and the timing and all that stuff and and I'll forget the factored in Rome what's when app which go and I said. Usually get fired I thought was to come in on what sort of did but. I knew that this was gonna happen the way it happened the way it panned out. In my remember us talking about it all the doors after the yet if she chipped to gain more after the Super Bowl turns out now they waited I was wrong again they waited till the Super Bowl parade. Two days later to Diller and meet 8 o'clock in the morning and me with soap one it is jet the Chris Curtis book call me. I was Corbett at just slowly guided and that's what I really sort of throw crap but it just got in from walking her dog. And my Scotty Terry if there was chart to imagine that we got her sort of brought Stanley Cup run so that's a good bit of irony here. But. And then. I just turn I just happened I just I had my phone with the soy and on and I'm glad that they called I just start first that was and for a split second minute to start laughing. Then I just had to god this is this is what they do it is not the first time they've handled the situation the way they have. Just absolutely ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. And for nearly two c'mon. During its press conference and talk about. We knew we were gonna get pounded. I don't underscored I don't understand how we're trying to hide any. Thing. I mean do you do you really think that maybe it's fed babies sack dance I don't know. What to make that statement like we're all stupid. Don't went made a lot of us not only the meat of affair at the white probably predicted. That this would happen await the. And you talk about how wide the organization is the only one in town that doesn't do regular interviews and you talk about. It's painful you guys are painful. That's. That's all you got. It's painful to any views on a weekly basis. Only. Really. Well I'd pick your season ticket holders would like to hear some accountability on a weekly basis. I really do. On somebody. Are back to the phones get about president of personnel. Bryant a valuable that they bride to see you start up that outside of that that's look at my that's okay. They keep track giveaway gag but not. I mean how would look at post retard it's our. All at nearly 500 points one of 6500. Ultimately it's about. It's never gonna disqualify Google's. And let me get don't get there don't. Forget how are totally out and help the white. They don't see what I thought we want to achieve acting thing. It was me and all were probably at the outlook. I'll 201112. That the best record NHL the loss of the first round say United's best playoff series and scored. He scored a couple of goals at that arose from let's watch it that they go to get back to the cup in ninety seconds away from ports and a game seven win at the team should create an EUR. And and and and it's come to this. I mean here we are dad back at the end of the O'Connell with team it's it's that some ways it's even worse because at least you grad. A championship level team here you didn't have the ecology and but I did a Lister of all the players. A little and think about this and appeared to your earlier but these guys O'Connell was responsible for. For getting it with the Bruins talked about march in Lucic grade sheet just Bergeron. Tim Thomas added both broke models. Right Rask yes that's not a yes yes. On the not rats not rest on that topic Tim Thomas yeah. Saudi this. It took me it's a it's a me I'd I'd I'd just I cannot believe where this organization is right now and I hit a tic tic last night's game seriously because it one game. I just thought what are our rapid acting didn't like but anyway. It. Just got to go with a child got nothing to do with what's going on here right now cabbie told Charlie's been told to zip it. Basically this is oddly old man this is odd Jeremy Jacobs off. You don't recipe or he's gonna have the balls to get rid of this. One office and Andy's got a department and start all over that's only stopped but being delusional. Like you gonna be make the playoffs security agency to get humiliated them first round by the capitals or some aura. Or Pittsburg or anybody I mean I don't wanna hear it I mean I don't wanna hear about teams in the eight spot go on runs of blob a block. They're gonna have a really hard time making the playoffs. What would they put up a guy like that it's. At the deadline to get better. I I don't know I think they try to epic ever somebody at the it's still going to be Craig cheek at a much sure they're probably not gonna get back not that you have a great year preseason. But you're probably going to. Whatever it is Mike Mike topic I'd go competence might might duck billed as a screwed up. Those are not. Just brought up. This particular traded for Zack warden all dull. And David thought well pick for the that's yet one of the worst rates in Boston sports history that. Rick Ronaldo. Now don't they do it's okay they traits Salem and get on July it will debilitated at that they can actually. That they got a record and the verdict that is an extra. In a bag and want logo it correctly yet to be better. While at back McCaw I don't know up marker columns scum bags or their fair but they are delusional. They're absolutely delusional. Not to think that fans around you or season ticket holders and not gonna pay a company like I said. I've gotten desperate and mean I've had season ticket. People come out to be good to us. Tell me these records of being involved in these little. Season ticket holders seminars. A little dinners with a Charley Jacobs is stuff and went and standing questions have been brought up. As to what direction team was going bottle blonde ever for more than two people that said I was told by people that don't like it didn't get reviewed tickets. Well. We know what good luck next year there are sponsors that I know that so ready to Paula. I don't sponsors were upset at the way that scandal on bide that but at its sponsors were. Unless it were very upset at the way that whole thing went down on Tuesday that I can tell you as well. So once it starts at derby tickets in the pocket. Maybe that's when he decides that to make India a change. In the front office it's sadly needed it's overdue. I'm sorry John Sweeney. It's just not working out and it probably unfair to you. Because I still think cam is having the final say in much of this is eagle was way out of control. I calls painful talked to the media really. Really watch you talk to season ticket hold legitimate call camp explain yourself to them. Like he tried to do the other day yesterday and it failed. Miserably 61777. Night 7037. Brett. So Dexter every it Brett what's up. I'll try apologists say Pete you are under center right. You saw that common you had insiders see this coming I remember that that that all the way. A couple weeks ago where you just dish write down that you were harder present right. Well you know look I was off on the timing of the firing but that's to me that wasn't the story the store was going to be key because he was that he was already everybody knew we was get fired. It been fired from the previous which means is there to score with three emotions a form of emotional okay. The bigger. I'll I'll also look myself and giving myself put out a boy for the way it all went down exactly how I thought it would happen. They would wait for a moment like Tuesday when was the issue chip to game. The day before the super ball. Are or that it's a bit but they out they've they've proved wrong that they went through. Today the parade at 8 o'clock seven what 50 in the morning that we comes down that they have relieved coach Julian of his duties I mean what does that. An honest to god and it's just at its history is not the first time Brent as you know. Well that them there and I want to call it because what I at all. Really. A change in question it. Corporate ownership. I got the John Aldridge is number one we're having our time with a sell by different agency for should patio can produce open up their. That's right actually would go to Freddy Freddy is up next here on W I with Peter Freddie. It is titled good how are you about a grapefruit such that they. The Bruins of that. And hide behind the curtain went it was an audience since 2013. And they really have. And they haven't had any stones since. It took place at the quotes like that. You know there really turn up a hardcore hardcore audience. Who every game that we 101000 people there about. You know. They're real good at each of the book us. While Leo that's got that come from ownership I mean there are they're beneath the sack up and get rid of the front office and retool the scouting department have to get at the change. It absolutely has to change this is kit kit continue like this and that. The delude me Cam Neely is it gonna be delusional man I mean I don't know maybe needs this at our top to talk to somebody I don't know. But the what's coming out of his mouth is not. It it it's fake and phony and go by that nobody is buying it a ten yard barber told you this change. Yeah. Let's just stick I told you I know I can always rely on FaceBook over the applicant who posted it in democracy this is by the lower. But the I don't want me to sponsor credit a lot and all that I know what major sponsors whether pull up and what S a the way that was handled. Are the other day so I mean that's that's what happens this year directed their records should be. You know that too low class move against cyclists organization. In the city use supposedly. And I tell works well yeah. A couple of feet. Yup thanks Brett appreciate it six or seven dollar or Freddie six point 77797. Under through seventeen spreads back with the better phone and Brett. They are about the right now are. So get back what I think is it all on ownership. Bit. Their own. Ban on debt equity and the other everything. And they don't care about the players. And you know this pattern. I know the governor Knuble and and then they claim that they know what was going on there remember I was sitting here. It has every dealt with Felger you're not with a short together that day Harrison there was some of those for a half an hour tried to explain. What happened. Anna and I said Harry you wrote the rules. How big claim they didn't know what was going public as an organization was eight wide apart write the rules. And it paid out that your right to destroy that that character. This whole pattern over and over and over and it's so people can actually hit. That is gonna keep pumping money. I the I think people see you bright and appreciated thanks for the call but. You know this is going to be a thirty year old to miss the playoffs and I don't believe commitment playoffs. And for a variety of reasons. But. You people of people had enough three years in a row you can either negotiate that I mean is always. I don't like the people use the word you liberals have the most diehard fans. Over everybody else and a much or by that. At all I mean it's like hockey fans on page a liberal speak to the words Celtic Arby's some threats oxidant. Patriots are a bunch of times that that. Image gets portrayed admiral experience like all of a sub acute care more about the brewers a new team to the diehards know I mean. I I think we if you know he watches tape of so many years. Benefit of all four teams that'll that'll categorize myself affair and of all the with the teams and want all the when the teams to do well out here what the supporters. You know what time I'll root lout I can't root for the atomic camera for a particular team is when B was playing BC hockey in my house of my way exit. India BC you know grad.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides MWC 2017 LG G6 Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 Nintendo Switch iOS 10.3 News Apple boss hints at augmented reality for the iPhone Apple boss hints at augmented reality for the iPhone By Michelle Fitzsimmons Wearables   Tim Cook says AR is 'a big idea like the smartphone' Shares Apple CEO Tim Cook is a fan of augmented reality. He's made no secret he thinks it will trounce virtual reality, even going so far as to say AR use will eventually be as common as "eating three meals a day". Today, we've gotten more from the Apple boss on what he thinks of AR, and while we're still waiting on a concrete device that projects digital images onto the real world from the iPhone maker, it seems like it's only a matter of time now. Cook chatted with The Independent during his visit to the UK this week, and in the interview Cook said he prefers AR over VR because it "allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what's happening presently."  "Most people don't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it," Cook said of VR. "With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance." Notably, Cook compared AR to probably the biggest consumer electronic device on the planet:  "I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone," he said. "The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it's for everyone. I think AR is that big, it's huge." "I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining," Cook continued. "I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it's not a product per se, it's a core technology." Clues to Apple's AR future Again, Cook has talked about his excitement for AR before, so there's no new revelation there. But dig a little deeper, and we get a few hints about how Apple might approach the tech, if ever.  Cook sounds keen to have AR be both useful and enjoyable, perhaps with applications for education, medicine and the workplace, along with leisure activities, like games. He would also appear to prefer something with see-through lenses, similar to Microsoft HoloLens, that lets users stay engaged with what's going on around them while also interacting with an AR overlay. Or, perhaps like 9to5Mac points out, Apple actually isn't working on a new device at all, but rather developing more AR features for the iPhone.  "I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that's why I get so excited out it," Cook told The Independent. What is more prevalent in our daily lives than our smartphones? Will Apple release AR tech simliar to Google's Tango? The iPhone 8 is rumored to have AR capabilities, including adding 3D effects to photos, and we can see Apple developing AR technology akin to Google's Tango for phones and tablets, or the Daydream mobile VR platform. Going this route would allow Apple to dive into AR without building, marketing and selling an entirely new product. What's more, Cook said he views AR as a core technology, similar to silicon in a handset, suggesting iPhone AR could be applied to other categories, such as tablets, computers and TV.  All this is certainly possible, though a recent report coming from VR/AR evangelist Robert Scoble, citing sources "at the highest levels," points to the tech giant teaming up with Carl Zeiss to develop augmented reality glasses, and a standalone VR/AR device has been rumored to be in development at Apple for some time. Cook, of course, could be talking about smart spectacles or other AR device as well. Whatever Apple is working on behind the scenes, it will likely be a while before we see it in an official capacity. Cook ended his interview with a caution there's still a ways to go before AR is "good enough for the mainstream," suggesting Apple, like it usually does, won't release a product until the tech has reached a certain level of maturity.  Via 9to5Mac The best iPhone deals this month Tags iPhone ABOUT THE AUTHOR Michelle Fitzsimmons Michelle is TechRadar's Senior News Editor, based in the Bay Area.

YC-backed Pilot is building a contractor platform geared for the future of work Posted 19 hours ago by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story Nissan’s X-Wing Rogue is the crossover SUV the galaxy needs right now What’s a six year old startup doing entering Y Combinator? Plotting a new growth trajectory after a pivot. Pilot may be a veteran in Silicon Valley startup terms but it reckons the freelance contractor marketplace model it switched to around a year and a half ago is ideally positioned to serve a future of work that’s increasingly fragmented and distributed. So while the business has long been profitable it’s now getting put through its paces at YC’s bootcamp, and will likely be looking to raise VC funding once it graduates to help it step on the gas, says co-founder Matt Drozdzynski. “We’re focusing on enterprise customers right now, because that’s where we feel like the pain is strongest and where we can make the most impact. But long term we think of ourselves as more of an enabler of the future of work — of an environment where every company could be working with a vastly distributed talent pool, everywhere in the world. “The ultimate end game here [is] where we could be this talent infrastructure, almost, for a lot of companies — not only the Fortune 500s that we’re going after right now, but also for early stage startups. And any company in between.” Pilot is not the only startup thinking how it can serve and tap into growing demand for more flexible and piecemeal, gig economy style ways of working. Lystable is another that springs to mind, though unlike Pilot, Lystable is just making the platform — not seeking to operate a contractor marketplace of its own. And a curated talent marketplace is key to Pilot’s proposition, with in-house vetting and ongoing assessment of its freelance talent pool (and currently a wait list to get onto its books). It’s also not just matchmaking contractors with vacancies and then walking away after trousering a hiring fee, like some in this space; Pilot’s role (and fee) continues for the duration of any contract, acting as a support platform to help resolve issues that might arise during the term of the project. It’s intending to develop machine learning tools to automate performance tracking in future to aid management of its remote contractors. Though — at least at this point — its employer clients are large enough that they do have in-house staff whose primary role is to manage teams, including Pilot’s remote freelancers, so it’s only aiming to offer assistance rather than fully replace human managers. The talent-vetting process Pilot users does involve a lot of manual work, to ensure it’s identifying high quality contractors with strong communication skills to allow onto its platform (it says it’s prioritizing comms skills because of its focus on remote work). But it reckons it can scale that in future by looping in relevant expertise sourced from its own marketplace. So, in other words, its vetted talent can become paid vetters to help it scale the size of the marketplace, as and when needed. In terms of core tech, Drozdzynski says that’s its matching algorithm for connecting contractors with vacancies (again with a little human input looped in at the end of the process to select candidates from an algorithmic shortlist). This is another area it intends to enhance with machine learning going forward, as it pulls more performance data and learnings off its platform, he adds. “The key is understanding or matching contractors to projects and this is something that we’re able to do much more efficiently because of the software that we’ve written,” he argues. “We don’t have to automate all of the [vetting] tests to make this process much more efficient, by just using software to co-ordinate some of these human efforts. So I think by being smart about the features that we build into the platform we’re able to maximize our efficiency when it comes to using human labor.” “One thing that we’re also really excited about is some of the things that we can do by connecting different tools that our contractors use — like time-tracking software, GitHub, Trello, project management tools — connecting them into our system and then being able to infer what’s happening on the project, what are the potential issues, and basically entirely automate the function of a project manager. Our contractors are managed by project managers within large companies but we can make sure that they’re as effective as they can be by helping them out in this automated fashion. That’s something we are really excited about long term — this notion of giving our talent ‘superpowers’. Giving them all of these tools that they would need to be extremely effective remote workers. “So that’s something we are really excited about long term — this notion of giving our talent ‘superpowers’. Giving them all of these tools that they would need to be extremely effective remote workers wherever they happen to be around the world.” Pilot’s pivot away from its original, more traditional consultancy firm/dev shop model, where it had some 60 paid contractors on staff to fill a mixed bag of clients’ needs, came not so much from a flash of inspiration about the inexorable rise of the gig economy, says Drozdzynski, but more gradually; from analyzing its operational data and realizing there was a another need it could move into serving. “We weren’t very happy with our model,” he tells TechCrunch, discussing how the pivot came about. “We found that our developers were happiest working for companies that were a little bit larger, a little bit more established, and they’d already had engineering teams because they don’t want to be the only developer on a project, they wanted a stable paycheck, they wanted to work on a team so they can learn from other people — so this is kind of what led us to realize that we should only work with companies that are large enough to support a full engineering team. As opposed to say a small, early stage startup. “We realized that …if we opened the company up to independent contractors then we can not only pay them more — in some cases double or triple what they’re making before — but we can also lower the cost for our customers, and allow them to hire better quality talent for the same price that they were paying before. And the reason we were able to do that is if you work with larger companies these tend to be longer term projects, six months+.”   At this point Pilot has no contractors on its payroll; its marketplace of vetted talent is free to work elsewhere should they wish. It’s not disclosing the number of contractors on its books at this point, nor the number of employers it’s working with. Nor will it name many customer names either, though there are a few examples on its website — such as long time client travel publisher, Lonely Planet. Drozdzynski agrees a target employer could include a company such as Google which clearly has ongoing needs for the kind of developer and design talent that Pilot is working to pull in. Ultimately, he reckons workers want the flexibility of being able to work remotely from home (as essentially all Pilot workers do) so they can be with their family or so they can travel, but combined with the reliability of a steady wage. And contractors can get that from Pilot because it offers longer term project work, and lets them line up the next gig as needed. (He says its longest serving gig between one of its contractors and one of its employers has gone on four years at this point.) It’s able to attract talent because he says it takes a lower cut of wages than an average dev shop, for example, charging a fixed 30 per cent fee over the duration of any contract — with the rest (i.e. 70 per cent) going to the contractor. The imperative on the employer side which Pilot is seeking to tap is the pressing problem for enterprises of filling in-demand talent vacancies — giving businesses an incentive to accept a vetted contractor as a remote addition to an existing IT or design team if it means they get to tap into skills they might otherwise find hard to secure. Pilot’s philosophy is that a globally distributed talent pool ultimately means more choice and, statistically speaking, access to better choices (“We believe talent is evenly distributed across the globe,” is how Drozdzynski puts it). And demand for engineers and designers typically continues to outstrip supply — hence in part Pilot’s focus on those two skills. He reckons the model could work for other product development roles, and perhaps more widely still for all sorts of other work that can be done remotely. But with a lot of job specific expertise and knowledge needed to support the smooth running of the platform, and to underpin the development of additional tech features (such as its machine learning plans), he says it makes most sense for Pilot to constrain itself to those two (in-demand) skills for now. “We’re trying to stay focused on what we know right now, and I think it’s more likely to be other areas in product development, broadly speaking, where we can be of help. If you look at some of the recruiting marketplaces, like Hired, they branch out to other verticals — like sales and marketing — and the reason for that is that their core competency is just on the screening part. That’s where they focus 99 per cent of their time because as soon as a customer has hired someone they never see that person again, at least until they’re looking for another job. Whereas the difference with a platform like our is that that moment where somebody gets hired is almost the beginning of a journey, as opposed to the end of it. “So the reason why it makes sense for us to constrain ourselves to certain domains is that if we want to build up the machine learning features around predicting what makes for a good worker, what makes for a bad worker, based on the output that they’re producing — then that’s very output specific. Even doing design and development is already quite difficult because the tools that each contractor uses are very different; a developer will be using GitHub and writing code, a designer would be using Sketch and sharing files with Dropbox. So if we want to integrate with all of these tools, these are very different problems.” Why is it operating a marketplace at all? Why not just provide the platform and tools to help companies manage their own freelancers? Drozdzynski’s take on that is that the most pressing need for most businesses is filling vacancies rather than gearing up for the more distributed, on-demand workforces that are coming down the pipe. So the strategy is to secure a working relationship with enterprises now, by first helping them fill their empty seats; after which the team has a foot in the door so is better positioned to sell the advantages of its contractor management platform, and to add smarter features over time to serve its users’ changing needs. “On the companies side I think the talent problem — in terms of not being able to find great talent — is a more pressing one, than ‘I have too many contractors that I have to manage today’,” argues Drozdzynski, adding: “I think we would rather bring a client to a contractor and then have them realize how great our systems are, and how great out platform is — and then bring their customers into the platform, than the other way around.” “We’re working towards that [bigger] vision [of becoming a talent infrastructure for all sorts of companies]. Building tools that make it easier for contractors to work with anyone in the world and vice versa, building tools for companies that make it extremely easy to find and hire these talented individuals, wherever they happen to be in the world… They won’t have to figure out the logistics of that, they won’t have to be scouting for people in all of these different cities, figuring out the legal/administrative work required to event hire that talent pool.” In terms of competitive landscape, he says the team’s current focus on enterprises’ recruitment needs puts it in competition with the likes of Accenture, IBM, Infosys and Cognizant — so it’s competing for customers with the big, management consultancy type firms, rather than (at least most of the time) smaller recruitment startup players. “There’s also dev shops and smaller consulting shops that we run into occasionally but those typically can’t meet the very growing needs of large enterprise customers,” he says. “We can deliver better talent faster, and because it’s a software platform they can use we don’t get in their way — they don’t have to schedule a call or a meeting with an account manager to get anything done.” Given the size of some of its rivals Pilot’s desire to step on the gas now (via YC and probably also by taking VC) makes sense. He says it’s looking to build out an enterprise sales team as a priority now. It’s also continuing to work on the product, with a new version of its client app due to launch in the next few months to further streamline identifying and hiring contractors, especially for the target enterprise user. “We’re definitely looking into raising a venture capital round because we’re seeing this model as something that can scale and can grow into a really large company. If we’re competing with the likes of Accenture it will take capital to get there,” he notes, adding: “We’re already talking to some investors so that’s something that will come after YC — so in a couple of months.” Featured Image: sirastock/Shutterstock 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Y Combinator Founded 2005 Overview Y Combinator is a startup accelerator based in Mountain View, CA.

(Mandel Ngan / AFP/Getty Images) By Maura Dolan and David LauterContact Reporters Immigration Donald Trump Islamic State A federal appeals court is considering whether to lift a hold on President Trump’s moratorium on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries, and it has already received a flurry of written arguments on how the case should be decided. A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to reach a decision after the Trump administration files further arguments by 3 p.m. Monday.  The case stems from a temporary restraining order issued Friday by U.S. District Judge James L. Robart in Seattle. The judge, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, blocked the government from enforcing President Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order. The ruling came in response to a challenge from the states of Washington and Minnesota.  The Trump administration has argued the states lack standing to challenge the travel ban because they cannot show the executive order has directly harmed them. Documents Read the executive order that ignited the firestorm and the ensuing legal filings. The U.S. Supreme Court has overturned some major 9th Circuit rulings in the past after concluding that those who sued lacked standing. Interestingly, the Obama administration was unsuccessful in trying to argue that states that challenged its executive order shielding a number of so-called Dreamer immigrants from deportation lacked standing to challenge the order. In that case, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked Obama’s order, and the Supreme Court tied 4-4 over the issue. It was that case that Robart cited in ruling against the Trump administration on the current moratorium. Whatever decision the 9th Circuit reaches on the travel ban could be the final word for some time, if the Supreme Court does not agree to review it, or can’t muster a majority. Keep in mind, though, that the appeals court on Monday is deciding only whether to stay the order until the legal merits can be reviewed. Below are key arguments opposing parties have made on the travel ban hold. Trump administration The states claim that they are harmed by virtue of the damage that implementation of the order has inflicted upon the operations and missions of their public universities and other institutions of higher learning, as well as injury to the states’ operations, tax bases, and public funds. … These attenuated and speculative alleged harms are neither concrete nor particularized. The administration also argued that the hold on Trump’s order harmed the government by infringing on the president’s power over foreign affairs. The states maintain the government has not suffered any real harm. The injunction contravenes the constitutional separation of powers; harms the public by thwarting enforcement of an Executive Order issued by the nation’s elected representative responsible for immigration matters and foreign affairs; and second-guesses the President’s national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of aliens and the best means of minimizing that risk. States of Washington and Minnesota The states argued the ban violates constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection and religious freedom. In the following section, the states, citing a precedent from a key same-sex marriage case, contend that the mere scope of the order shows it was intended to discriminate. Even if the Order did not make suspect classifications, it would be illegal because ‘its sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons offered for it that the [Order] seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects.’ Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632 (1996). For several months it bans all travelers from the listed countries and all refugees, whether they be infants, schoolchildren, or grandparents. And though it cites the attacks of September 11, 2001, as a rationale, it imposes no restrictions on people from the countries whose nationals carried out those attacks. ‘It is at once too narrow and too broad,’ id. at 633, and cannot withstand any level of scrutiny. See, e.g., United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2693 (2013) (‘The Constitution’s guarantee of equality must at the very least mean that a bare [legislative] desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot justify disparate treatment of that group.’). The states also contrasted Trump’s action with previous cases involving presidential actions on immigration. Second, Defendants cite Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753 (1972), and Kerry v. Din, 135 S. Ct. 2128 (2015), for the proposition that so long as the President gives a facially legitimate reason for excluding an alien, the courts will not look behind that reason. But those cases dealt with the President’s power to exclude ‘an unadmitted and nonresident alien,’ i.e., someone who had no legal right to be here. Mandel, 408 U.S. at 762; Din, 135 S. Ct. at 2131. This case, by contrast, involves longtime residents who are here and have constitutional rights. Moreover, Justice Kennedy’s controlling opinion in Din held that courts should look behind the stated motives for exclusion even as to a nonresident alien if the plaintiff “plausibly alleged with sufficient particularity” “an affirmative showing of bad faith.” Id. at 2141. See also Cardenas v. United States, 826 F.3d 1164, 1171 (9th Cir. 2016) (same). Here, the State has plausibly alleged with sufficient particularity that the President acted in bad faith in an effort to target Muslims. ECF 18 ¶¶ 42-61. Thus, courts have both the right and the duty to examine Defendants’ true motives. 97 companies tell the court how the travel ban harms them The companies, including Microsoft, Twitter, Google and Apple, are making an economic argument on why the hold should stay in place. The companies cited the outsized role that immigrants have played in the United States in obtaining patents and winning Nobel prizes and argued that the ban could force industry to relocate overseas to ensure availability of talent from around the world. Trump campaigned on keeping jobs in the United States, and the tech companies argued that his executive order will have the opposite effect. The Order effects a sudden shift in the rules governing entry into the United States, and is inflicting substantial harm on U.S. companies. It hinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent; increases costs imposed on business; makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace; and gives global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations — and hire new employees — outside the United States. The Order violates the immigration laws and the Constitution. In 1965, Congress prohibited discrimination on the basis of national origin precisely so that the Nation could not shut its doors to immigrants based on where they come from. Moreover, any discretion under the immigration laws must be exercised reasonably, and subject to meaningful constraints. Former national security and intelligence officials Ten former national security, foreign policy and intelligence officials argued the travel ban was threatening the safety of Americans. Most of the officials served solely in Democratic administrations. The Order will endanger U.S. troops in the field. Every day, American soldiers work and fight alongside allies in some of the named countries who put their lives on the line to protect Americans. For example, allies who would be barred by the Order work alongside our men and women in Iraq fighting against ISIL, [the militant group Islamic State]. To the extent that the Order bans travel by individuals cooperating against ISIL, we risk placing our military efforts at risk by sending an insulting message to those citizens and all Muslims. The Order will disrupt key counterterrorism, foreign policy, and national security partnerships that are critical to our obtaining the necessary information sharing and collaboration in intelligence, law enforcement, military, and diplomatic channels to address the threat posed by terrorist groups such as ISIL. The international criticism of the Order has been intense, and it has alienated U.S. allies. It will strain our relationships with partner countries in Europe and the Middle East, on whom we rely for vital counterterrorism cooperation, undermining years of effort to bring them closer. By alienating these partners, we could lose access to the intelligence and resources necessary to fight the root causes of terror or disrupt attacks launched from abroad, before an attack occurs within our borders. maura.dolan@latimes.com Twitter: @mauradolan ALSO Legal battle over Trump's travel ban could rest on Supreme Court's view of the limits of presidential power A flurry of legal arguments as appeals court decides whether Trump's immigration ban will be enforced California joins 15 other states going to court to challenge Trump's immigration orders       Copyright © 2017, Los Angeles Times Most Popular Local Sports Entertainment Politics Opinion Place An Ad 60°

Devindra Hardawar, @devindra 13h ago in Transportation Comments 303 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Seemingly out of the blue, Ford announced today that it's investing $1 billion in Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based company building self-driving technology. Ford is effectively buying the previously unknown startup, which was founded by engineers from Google and Uber. Argo AI will operate as an independent subsidiary and will focus on developing a software platform for Ford's self-driving car, which the company is targeting for 2021. Notably, Ford is also planning to license the technology out to other companies. While the extent of the deal is surprising, it makes sense for Ford, especially after GM acquired the self-driving car startup Cruise for over $1 billion last year. As we've seen with the steady progress from Google's Waymo, autonomous driving technology is evolving quickly. Car companies have to make some big moves now if they don't want to get left behind once the technology becomes essential in a few years. Ford will combine the team building its virtual driver system, which serves as the "brains" of the self-driving cars, together with Argo AI. Both companies will benefit from the new arrangement: Ford doesn't have time to waste building its own AI platform from scratch, and Argo will need help getting its technology to consumers once it's ready.

 Apple CEO Tim Cook: 'We don’t support the immigration ban' Kif Leswing Feb. 8, 2017, 5:21 PM 2,124 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Apple CEO Tim Cook gave the company's most full-throated condemnation of President Trump's recent immigration order while he was overseas, in Scotland. “We don’t support the immigration ban and we have been very public about it,” Cook said at a ceremony at the University of Glasgow, where he was receiving an honorary degree. "Our simple view is that Apple would not exist without immigration, so this is a huge issue for us. So what do we do? We voice our opinion and stand up - we don’t sit in silence," Cook said, according to the Scotsman, which was at the event. During a Q&A, Cook later said that he doesn't see Apple as an activist company. "I don't view Apple as an activist, and I don't view myself as an activist," he said. "The reason is that a lot of people hear that word and they think of a professional activist, and that's not what we are. What we do, for things that we have deep knowledge on, or think we do, or a strong point of view based on what we've learned, that gives us some standing to make a point, we're not shy. We'll stand up even when our voice shakes." Cook said that within 24 hours of Trump signing the order, he sent an email to all Apple employees addressing the order.

In it also, the shy and timid find a refuge to hide and shoot Cupid’s arrows at the objects of their desires. Yet for others, it is the grease with which the wheel of love is oiled to keep it in smooth motion. Almost  invariably, the old art of love letter writing had always deservedly fetched the authors the reward for their intellectual labour and ended in the “And they lived happily ever after”, story for love birds. Ladies, young and old, treasure such letters, sometimes accompanied with or without affectionate greeting cards, with equally well -crafted wordings of love, even for decades. “My wife is addicted to them-love letters, cards and all. Occasionally, she brings out some of the kept letters I wrote to her when we were courting and reads. She’s 42 years. Since we’ve been married, I have never missed giving her cards, especially on Valentine’s Day, Christmas or her birthday. If I didn’t, there would be trouble, because she likes it so much”, says Willy Eya, an editor with a Lagos-based leading national newspaper who has been married for 17 years. The culture of writing love letters and exchanging cards was extremely popular and thrived before the advent of Global System of Mobile Telephony (GSM) in 2001 in Nigeria. Although it left no age bracket out, it was particularly common among youngsters–secondary school pupils and students of higher institutions, who, by virtue of their ages, of course, were more adventurous in amorous matters and/or seeking to contract marital ties. Back in those days, hand-written letters were the means of communicating feelings among love birds. The message is often written on specialised and artistically designed letter writing sheets or torn pages of the pupils’ Higher Education exercise books and may run from one full page to six or even 10, depending on the wealth of resources in the literary ‘arsenal’, depth and creative ability of the writer in expressing his intentions and feelings. This is then mailed or sent through emissaries, usually friends, siblings or neighbours of the loved one, from whom a “favourable response” is anxiously anticipated. Among well-to-do members of the society, the letter is accompanied by romantic cards, flowers and/or gifts, a gesture copied from the western culture to which they are exposed through early contact, movies or literature. However, the coming of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), especially mobile telephone that has eased the process of communication and made it a lot swifter, has tended to displace this tradition and made it look anachronistic. Now, with a simple touch on the button or keypad of any electronic device, be it handset, iPad, IOS, Blackberry or any other, love struck suitors can express how they feel about their adored prospects and receive instant response either orally or through pinging  or other forms of texted messages! Save for couples like the Eyas, still nostalgic about the glorious era, many people, including the elderly already in established relationships, are forsaking letter writing and taking to the more facile electronic version through their phones and other devices to express their feelings and emotions to loved ones. Chief Stephen Olusola Ayangbayi is a retired Permanent Secretary in Oyo State. The 67 year-old says: “I use the phone to send sms or whatsapp messages. That’s what I do now, because I don’t know when last I went to the  Post Office to buy stamp to post letter. Even if my wife is away to Ogbomoso for some time and I’m here in Ibadan, or I have some privileged information about what’s going on in the home to pass to the children, wherever they are, we easily get it across to ourselves and get instant reaction through the social media. This is quite unlike in our days when it took between three and four days for such messages to reach the destination and about the same span of time to get a response.” Chief Ayangbayi adds that he hardly buys cards for his wife also, except on Valentine’s Day or her birthday, stressing that: “Even if I get something with fascinating expression, I try to memorize it and put it on my phone and then send to her.” The retired top civil servant explains that besides the inevitability of “blending” with dynamic society, he particularly finds exciting the special features of the modern means of communication in that they enable participants to deepen their intimacy and enliven the interaction. “Talk of the smiley, hugs, audio and videos, etc, that colour and enhance the emotion you are trying to convey. You can get someone to laugh or cry, if you want to,” remarks Chief Ayangbayi. If the situation is like that with the elderly, it can be better imagined among the youths. “I don’t know about that (hand written letter). It’s old fashioned. I didn’t meet such things anyway. It’s my smartphone for me,” quips Ms. Shirley Tomiwa Adelegan, a 22-year old online marketer. Shirley who has a boyfriend who is studying in Ukraine says they are able to break the barrier of distance by keeping in touch through regular phone chats and texts. A counterpart of hers based in Ikeja, Lagos, Ms. Olufunmi Amosun, also votes for the gadgets, noting that they make it a lot easier for partners and friends to connect and stay in touch at any hour of the day, irrespective of the distance. Her words: “Apart from the fact that you can get what needs to be said, said on the phone, texts allow you send love messages at any point in time. You have some texting so early in the morning to know how you are doing and some late in the day, sometimes when you are already curled up in bed, to say nice words. So, at every point in time you feel love around you, you feel part of the world of that person. Nobody writes letters these days again. That one has gone extinct. it’s archaic.” Julius Eiyebiokin, a Port Harcourt-based IT professional, shares the ladies’ views. He says: “For me, phone texts is it. It saves the time and effort in the aspect of communication and transportation. I can instantly express how I feel to my loved one with the use of virtual emoticons.” But some Nigerians are mourning the fast dying old tradition of letter writing. They argue that apart from reflecting and encouraging their alleged intellectual laziness, the ascendancy of the use of information technology in intimate relationships is eroding values and taking out the excitement formerly associated with it. Oladusi Komolafe, a Deputy Director at the Lagos State Council for Arts and Culture, in his 50s, regrets that the e-devices have taken off the youths the effort to read intensively and extensively as the older generation used to do, to prepare and compose masterpieces of letters in order to impress objects of their adoration. According to him, the intellectual worth of the young men and women is the worse for it. He blames the problem on the fallen standard of education and superficiality of the young people themselves, saying: “The quality of education now has waned as against those days. How many of today’s graduates can write good letters, with decent, correct sentences? They don’t have interest, their interest is in phone, distraction is too much. And because they are not ready to learn, what can they sit down to write. Whereas you would marvel if you see what a Standard VI school leaver wrote, with cursive, elegant hand writing. “In the past, we strive to get educated, because we know education opens doors, makes you a worthy member of the society. But, now, the priority has shifted, it’s now a rush for cheap money, whether in politics or through yahoo yahoo. There are no real models to emulate, no standard to aspire to.” Chief Ayangbayi agrees with Komolafe. He notes that the old medium, laborious and “crude” as it may sound to the present generation, promoted learning and the literary culture to a large extent. He recalls: “Many of us read literature books to acquire knowledge and in order to make expression with which to write the letters or relate situations such as in Othello, a Shakespaerean play, to the one at hand for a reaction from the other end. We challenged ourselves.” However, supporters of the new media believe they are even better placed in terms of knowledge base. Remarks Eyebiokin: “The internet has made things a lot easier. One only has to type in what one is looking for in Google; and voila, more than is even required will be searched in a matter of seconds.” But, critics insist that the painstaking effort of achieving things which characterised the way things were done back then is thereby eroded. They cite the adverse effect of the way this generation attempts at using short-cuts for virtually everything including abbreviating and abridging writing in the social media is gradually distorting formal mode of communication. Indeed, Emeritus Professor Ayo Banjo once noted how appalled he was on returning to his Department of English at the University of Ibadan, after a leave to serve as the Vice Chancellor of and retirement from the university, only to discover such aberrant writing mode  amongst students of a 400 Level class! Apart from that, Komolafe and Chief Ayangbayi believe the modern means of communication tends to be too permissive of moral laxity and make nonsense of the glorious hard to get game girls played during a chase back then. Notes Komolafe: “Our parents don’t open up for visitors to their daughters as you have now. So, you may live next door to your girl, but you may not see each other to talk. But, you write and you enjoy the secretiveness of it all. “But now, perhaps, all a boy needs to do is make a casual request, ask the girl, ‘Can I have your phone number’. And if she likes him, she gives him and from their on, it is taken that he’s toasted her and they start chatting on phone. So, any girl you are interested in is just a phone call away. Whereas back then, for three months, you are still stalking your proposed lover, you’re still lurking by the street corners.” But a young couple, Mr. Kolawole and Mrs. Rume Adelegan, expresses disdain for this view, describing it as a presumptuous generalisation. According to the Rume, although she met and exchanged phone numbers with her husband, who was working as an Estate agent in Festac, Lagos during a chance encounter near his office in 2011, it took months of  “hard work’ and chatting on phone on his part to eventually woo her. “As at the time we met in February, I was to go for my NYSC. Between that period we didn’t see, but he was always calling me. He didn’t tell me his intention, but we were always talking on the phone until about April/May when we got to see briefly when I came back from the NYSC camp. That was when our friendship moved to dating. He took me out and expressed his liking for me. In fact, he helped in my redeployment to Lagos State becausee then he said he would want me to be his wife.” Asked how they communicated when not together, Mrs. Adelegan quips: “Mostly we chatted or texted on phone. He would tell me: ‘ You have merry legs (2ce)’, ‘I like your eyes’,  ‘You ‘ve got a cherubic face’, ‘I look forward to when you’ll be my wife, ‘etc. There was no dull moment because there’s always gist to tell… No, he didn’t send any flowers, there was no card, but he was always calling. He sent a lot of texts. Sometimes he sent up to two pages.” Rume says she never missed getting cards from her fiancé, because “He was always flaunting my photograph as his DP (Display Picture) on his whatsapp and BBM accounts. That showed he was proud of me and ready to show it to the world.” To be continued next edition Share How I cure baldness using these natural techniques.

Uber has hired Moore to work on the company's flying-car initiative, known as Uber Elevate. Credit: NASA Uber has hired longtime NASA engineer Mark Moore to work on the rideshare company's flying-car project, according to Bloomberg Technology. Moore will become director of engineering for aviation and will help develop the Uber Elevate initiative, which envisions using "air taxis" to ferry people between "vertiports" located within 50 miles to 100 miles (80 to 100 kilometers) of each other, Bloomberg Technology reported Monday (Feb. 6). Moore has spent the last 30 years at NASA. His research into vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) craft — such as the electric Puffin concept vehicle — helped inspire Google co-founder Larry Page to start two flying-car companies, Zee.aero and Kitty Hawk, Bloomberg Technology reported. It won't be too long before we all move into the "Jetsons"-esque future such projects promise, according to Moore: He told Bloomberg Technology that he expects to see several different flying cars come online in the next one to three years. These vehicles will employ human pilots for the foreseeable future, Moore added. Read the full article on Bloomberg Technology.

(REUTERS/Brian Snyder) By Dustin Volz, Reuters Feb 6, 2017 at 2:41 pm | Print View WASHINGTON — National security veterans from both parties and major U.S. technology companies expressed opposition to Donald Trump’s temporary travel ban in a court case as his administration prepared on Monday to justify the measure, the most controversial policy of his two-week old presidency. Trump’s executive order of Jan. 27, temporarily barring entry to the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority countries and halting the U.S. refugee program, was suspended by a federal judge in Seattle on Friday. That opened a window for travelers from the seven countries to enter. The government now has until 3 p.m. PST on Monday to submit additional legal briefs to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in support of Trump’s order. A decision either way may ultimately result in the case reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. The new Republican president, who has said the travel measures are to protect the country against the threat of terrorism, has reacted to challenges to his ban by attacking the federal judge in Seattle and then the wider court system. Ten former national security and foreign policy officials, who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents, filed a declaration in the court case arguing the travel ban serves no national security purposes. It was signed by former secretaries of state including John Kerry, Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice and former CIA directors Michael Hayden and Michael Morell. Over the weekend, the appeals court in San Francisco denied the administration’s request for an immediate suspension of the federal judge’s temporary restraining order that blocked the implementation of key parts of the travel ban. But the court did say it would consider the government’s request after receiving more information. Trump faces an uphill battle in the San Francisco court, which is dominated by liberal-leaning judges. And appeals courts are generally leery of upending the status quo, which in this case is the suspension of the ban. On a visit to the military’s Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida, Trump defended his order. “Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11,” he said. “We need strong programs for people who love our country,” Trump said, adding that he did not want to allow “people who want to destroy us and destroy our country” into the United States. The measures put a 90-day ban on entry for citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day halt to all refugees. Top technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft banded together with nearly 100 firms on Sunday to file a “friend-of-the-court” brief with the appeals court, arguing the travel ban “inflicts significant harm on American business, innovation, and growth.” PRESIDENTIAL POWERS Curbing entry to the United States as a national security measure was a central premise of Trump’s run for office, originally proposed during his campaign as a temporary ban on Muslims. U.S. presidents have in the past claimed sweeping powers to fight terrorism, but individuals, states and civil rights groups challenging the travel order say his administration has offered no evidence it answers a threat. Protesters have taken to the street accusing Trump of discriminating against Muslims. The government says the president is exercising his constitutional authority to control borders and that the law allows him to suspend the entry of any class of foreigners who “would be detrimental to the interest of the United States.” The New America think tank says that all of the people who have carried out fatal attacks inspired by Islamist militancy in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks have been U.S. citizens or legal residents. None of those attackers emigrated or came from a family that emigrated from one of the countries listed in the travel ban. (http://bit.ly/2keSmUO) A businessman who had never held public office until he assumed the presidency on Jan. 20, Trump has vented his frustration over the legal challenges with a volley of attacks on the judiciary. Trump derided U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle, who issued the temporary stay on Friday, as a “so-called judge.” On Sunday, he broadened his Twitter attacks on Robart, who was appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush, to include the “court system.” “Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,” Trump tweeted. “If something happens blame him and court system.” Trump did not elaborate on what threats the country potentially faced. It is unusual for a sitting president to attack a member of the judiciary, which the U.S. Constitution designates as a check on the power of the presidency and Congress. Democrats seized on Trump’s remarks to raise questions about how independent his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, might be.

Rubrik, a company eWEEK has called "the rather impertinent startup that wants to replace in one fell swoop all conventional data backup-and-recovery point products that have taken 30-plus years for other companies to develop," has released a new version of its new-gen data-management system. Rubrik on Feb. 9 launched version 3.1 of its Cloud Data Management platform, which enables enterprises to add rich visual analytics as needed to processing various workloads and enhance security processes to protect business data. The platform manages physical Windows servers to obtain actionable insights from data visualization of the entire data management platform. It also secures data at rest on Rubrik appliances with software-based encryption, CEO and co-founder Bipul Sinha said. Rubrik does away with all the point products (backup server, backup proxies, replication, accelerators, deduplication, disk storage, tape, off-site storage) that are necessarily involved in conventional backup and recovery systems. It replaces them with a single-box, converged backup and globally deduplicated storage, in one package. Conventional backup/recovery is "too expensive, too brittle, too complex for the new world of IT," Sinha said. "With Rubrik, you only need to buy one thing: That one thing runs on commodity hardware and scales on commodity hardware, just like Google, Amazon, Facebook. If you have a small environment, you buy one box, which has four nodes; if you have a very large environment, you can buy hundreds of boxes of four-node clusters. But they still manage a single system." Smart Data Management and Protection The latest update of Rubrik's Cloud Data Management platform greatly expands its enterprise capabilities, including: --Physical Windows Server: Rubrik continues to rapidly expand support for the platforms enterprises rely on most. For physical Windows servers, customers can now leverage policy-driven, incremental forever data management while providing global predictive search for instant access to file versions across clouds. This adds to previously released support for physical environments, including SQL databases, Linux and NAS. --Rubrik Envision: Rubrik Envision delivers actionable insights, enabling customer to manage data at cloud scale. Customers can easily create, customize and share rich reports for platform analytics around data management, compliance and capacity utilization. --End-to-end Software Encryption: Rubrik bolsters its security capabilities by adding software-based encryption for Rubrik appliances. This updates adds to the previously released hardware-based encryption.  Enterprises can now secure both data and management planes via data encryption (hardware and software-based) and role-based access control. With this release, Rubrik adds to its support for numerous physical and virtual environments, including VMware, NAS, SQL databases, physical Windows servers, remote and branch offices and enhanced security environments. Overview of Three Years in Business Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Rubrik has positioned itself as a key player in the Cloud Data Management market, which supersedes traditional data protection due to its new capabilities to recover, manage and secure data across public and private clouds. In just three years, Rubrik has achieved the following: --grew to 250-plus employees across five continents; --approaching $100 million revenue bookings run rate, with seven-fold customer growth rate in 2016; --signed 220-plus channel partners; and --released seven major product versions, supporting 14 different physical, virtual and cloud platforms. Rubrik also announced the hiring of Mark Smith as Executive Vice President of Global Sales and Business Development.  Smith was previously a Senior Vice President, WW Sales and Business Development at Arista Networks, where he led the growth in revenues from $180 million to over $1 billion in four years. He brings 25years of experience in infrastructure sales, business development and channel expertise.         Chris Preimesberger is Editor of Features and Analysis at eWEEK. Twitter: @editingwhiz.

 Why the secretive $35 billion company behind Twix and M&Ms bet on Microsoft's big change Matt Weinberger Feb. 8, 2017, 5:54 PM 16,138 facebook linkedin twitter email print Mars Inc. CIO Vittorio CretellaMars Incorporated When Microsoft announced its last quarterly earnings in late January, CEO Satya Nadella took the time to shout out one customer in particular: Mars Incorporated, the secretive $35 billion company behind Twix, M&Ms, Life Savers, and 57 more popular brands. "An early adopter of Office 365, Mars is using Office and Windows 10 to transform how its 80,000-strong global workforce collaborates while staying secure," Nadella said on a conference call with reporters, analysts, and investors. Indeed, Mars CIO Vittorio Cretella tells Business Insider that the company has been a big fan of Office 365 since 2010, when Microsoft's cloud productivity suite was still sporting the far less catchy name Business Productivity Online Suite, or BPOS. When Mars first signed on with the Redmond giant, it was during the era of Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Now, just about seven years later, Cretella says that he's noticed a big, positive change at Microsoft under the three-year reign of Nadella. Now, Cretella says, Microsoft is more likely to "think of the solution first, instead of the technology first." In other words, rather than pushing any one product, Cretella says, Microsoft is selling Mars an ever-extending way for its employees to collaborate with each other. The Nadella years For instance, Cretella says, a lot of work still gets done at the company with Word, Excel, and all the other classic Microsoft Office apps. But in the last year or two, Cretella says, the company has started to see "exponential" internal usage of videoconferencing tool Skype for Business and the business social network Yammer — and it's all included in the same Office 365 subscriptions Cretella's department is already paying for.  It's a focus on the outcome, in contrast to the strong-arm Microsoft sales tactics of yesteryear that have been described as aggressive. And it's opening new doors for Microsoft, even as competition from Amazon and Google in the cloud puts more pressure on the tech titan. What Cretella really appreciates about Microsoft, Cretella says, is that they're on the same page: Like Mars, Microsoft has a brisk business in selling straight to consumers. But because of its long history of building products to big businesses, Microsoft also understands Mars' stringent needs around security. Microsoft CEO Satya NadellaGetty Images/Stephen Brashear Microsoft is a "consumer business," Cretella says, "but with an enterprise mindset." Other vendors the company periodically looks at (Cretella wouldn't name names, but Google is a strong possibility) had one but not necessarily the other. Plus, Cretella says, the company is starting to move important applications from its existing two data centers into the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform, where it gets access to the tech titan's ever-growing selection of supercomputing services.  A big part of the value of working with Microsoft, Cretella says, is that they can experiment with the more cutting-edge and modern ways of doing things, as with Skype or Azure, but still know that they won't be "let down with traditional infrastructure." Office still works like it should, as does the rest of the Microsoft tech it uses.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive log in weather Joe Nocera: 'Political' Super Bowl ads were up to something else Friday Feb 10, 2017 at 10:07 AM Feb 10, 2017 at 7:29 PM By Joe Nocera/Bloomberg View   What was the target audience for those commercials that ran during that Super Bowl on Sunday night? You know the ads I'm talking about _ the ones that were less about selling a product than conveying a sentiment about America. The Budweiser ad that depicted Adolphus Busch immigrating from Germany in the 1850s. ("Go back home," he's told as he walks down the street.) The Coca-Cola commercial, revived from 2014, in which Americans of different nationalities sing "America the Beautiful" in their native languages. The Expedia ad about influencing "narrow minds" and trying to "puncture prejudice." And, of course, the 84 Lumber commercial that tells the story of two illegal immigrants, a mother and a daughter, trying to find their way to the U.S. These ads have been widely depicted as being "political," and given the times we're living in, I suppose they are. When the Coke ad first ran three years ago, it was seen as just another of the company's heart-tugging ads about inclusion. Not this time. With the football game coming so soon after President Donald Trump's executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, the prism through which one saw these commercials was different. Not surprisingly, opponents of the ban took to Twitter to heap praise on the companies for standing up to the White House - often vowing to buy their products (Budweiser especially). Supporters of the ban, meanwhile, called for a boycott of Budweiser and 84 Lumber, among others. On Tuesday morning, articles about the Super Bowl ads - sold by Fox for $5 million per 30 seconds _ homed in on the politics. The Verge said that "it was almost impossible" not to see those message ads as "opposition against the new administration." The New York Times quoted Rob Schwartz, the chief executive of TBWAChiatDay's New York office, saying, in reference to one pro-diversity ad, "It's a big slap in the face of, 'Dude, this is America.'" But I don't think the ads were really meant to turn immigration supporters into customers - or to turn away customers who were pro-Trump. (Are they really going to stop drinking Bud?) With one exception, which we'll get to in a moment, I think the advertisers were aiming at a different constituency: their own employees. Go to the website of just about any big company. You'll invariably see a section devoted to the company's commitment to inclusion and diversity. You will also see a section about corporate social responsibility. And there will surely be some mention of the desire "to make a difference." Employees _ and I'm speaking here mainly of white-collar employees who work in big offices - want to believe that their employer is trying "to do the right thing." Along with "making a difference" and corporate social responsibility, that notion makes them feel good about working for Budweiser; it allows them to feel that they are serving a purpose larger than just selling beer. To take another example, being environmentally responsible may or may not save a company money, but it will surely cause the majority of its employees to swell with pride. That's a big part of the reason companies do it. In the global economy, every big company employs people who work abroad. U.S.-based employees travel around the globe. Most big companies also employ immigrants. Employees take it for granted that they will have colleagues who speak in accents, come from different backgrounds and are different races. At Uber, employees practically revolted when it appeared that their CEO, Travis Kalanick, would attend a Trump economic advisory council meeting. After a tense all-hands meeting, he resigned from the council. Elon Musk went to the Trump meeting but felt the need to state publicly that he objected to the ban. Google employees staged a walkout to protest it. Comcast employees in Philadelphia held a rally in front of City Hall. On Sunday night, a few hours after the Super Bowl, 97 companies signed an amicus brief asking the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to block the ban. The brief lists a host of reasons why the ban is bad for business: "It hinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent; increases costs imposed on business," etc. But there was also this: Immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries. America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants. As for that one exception I mentioned earlier, it's the ad for 84 Lumber, a $2.9 billion building-materials company south of Pittsburgh. The 84 Lumber ad extols not just immigration, but illegal entry into the U.S. It depicts the arduous journey of a mother and daughter in search of a better life, and though Fox refused to allow the company to show the full version, the ad even shows a border wall of the sort Trump wants to build. A few days before the Super Bowl, the company president, Maggie Hardy Magerko, spoke to a reporter for The New York Times about it. Magerko, who says she voted for Trump, said bluntly that the ad was a recruiting tool - presumably meaning she wanted illegal immigrants to apply for jobs. "I am all about those people who are willing to fight and go the extra yard to make the difference and then, if they have to, climb higher, go under, do whatever it takes to become a citizen," she told the Times. Or, for that matter, to become a worker at 84 Lumber. Or the founder of a brewery in St. Louis. Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Microsoft wants to make broken promises and the workplace conflicts they cause a thing of the past. A year ago, the Redmond, Wash. software giant previewed a new feature for Cortana that would help Windows 10 users honor the commitments they make via email. This week, the general public can finally take the technology, dubbed Cortana Suggested Reminders, for a spin. The feature requires that users add their Outlook.com or Office 365 work or school email accounts to the Cortana notebook under Connected Services. Once enabled, Microsoft's virtual assistant will keep tabs on those accounts in the background, helping users keep their word when they promise to do something. "Using machine learning technology developed in partnership with Microsoft Research, Cortana automatically recognizes when you make a commitment in email messages and will proactively suggest a reminder to you to follow through at just the right time," explained Marcus Ash, partner group program manager at Microsoft Cortana. After encountering this type of email, Cortana will automatically save the pertinent details in a new suggested reminder. "If you've specified a deadline in the email, Cortana will ping you before it's due and save it in the action center," added Ash. Other suggested reminders will be in the Cortana home. No need to copy her on the email or change how you do things today, she will adapt to you." Cortana Suggested Reminders is currently being rolled out to Windows 10 users. Microsoft is working on bringing the feature to Cortana apps for iOS and Android sometime in the next few weeks. The company is also looking to expand the list of supported services. Soon, users may not need a PC or smartphone to get reminders from Cortana. Joining the Amazon Echo and Google Home fray, Microsoft announced late last year that it had teamed with audio equipment maker Harman Kardon on a Cortana-powered standalone speaker. A short teaser video published by Microsoft on Dec. 13 shows the Echo-like speaker light up when the user says "Hey Cortana," before fulfilling requests to play a song and set a reminder. The device is set to arrive sometime this year. The competition isn't sitting still while Cortana explores new horizons. Last month, Google announced that Honeywell and Belkin had joined the Google Assistant ecosystem, enabling Google Home owners to add some smarts to their living spaces. "With Honeywell and your Google Assistant on Google Home, you can conveniently manage your home's temperature without leaving the comfort of your covers—just say 'Ok Google, turn the temperature up downstairs,'" wrote Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for Google Assistant, in a Jan 24 blog post. "And when you're headed out the door, Belkin Wemo and your Google Assistant can help you remember if you turned off the lights—just say 'Ok Google, did I leave the bedroom lights on?'"           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Google Android Wear 2.0 to Feature on-Device Machine Intelligence Cortana to Help Windows Users Keep Their Word on Promises in Email Google Addresses Concerns About URL Handling for AMP-Enabled Web Pages Cisco Report: Mobile Phones Will Number 5.5 billion by 2021 Evernote Makes Notetaking Frictionless in iOS App Revamp                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

I didn't always have a protein shake bottle with a large opening around.’” The Easy Scooper is a fitness invention that allows people to more easy pour their pre-workout supplements into a drink without spilling. This will help save time before heading out to the gym. ABOUT WORLD PATENT MARKETING World Patent Marketing is always looking for new invention ideas.

Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday launched a scathing attack on Narendra Modi over his 'raincoat' jibe and 'jokes' remark saying, Prime Minister likes to peep into bathrooms of people. Without naming, Modi on Friday had said that the maximum number of jokes that one will find online were made on the ministers of the grand old party. Addressing the media after releasing a Common Minimum Programme (CMP) at a joint press conference with Akhilesh Yadav, in Lucknow, Rahul Gandhi said, "Modi likes to read 'janampatri', search Google and peep into bathrooms of people...but he is a failure as PM" Modi will get a jolt from results of UP polls​, he added. "We want a government for the youth, one that has vision. These ten points in the joint programme are foundations of development," Rahul said talking about the CMP. Stating that it is not good to have too much anger, Akhilesh Yadav also hit out at PM Modi saying, "The anger shows that he is losing sand from beneath of his feet. No need for emotions and anger...these are elections for growth and prosperity of the state," he added. "PM and BJP should not 'mislead' people and come forward and tell what they have given to the state which has elected all prominent NDA leaders," Akhilesh said. Akhilesh also expressed happiness with the initial voting trend in the first phase of polling and said, "First votes went to SP-Cong alliance and so alliance will be ahead."​ Meanwhile, clearing the air about the differences between the alliance over a few seats, Rahul said, "On 99% of 403 seats there is no problem. Issues being resolved on remaining seats" "We are fighting polls together...wrong to say there is no coordination in alliance," Rahul added. Smartphones, skill development, free cycles and homes for the poor were among the key points in SP-Congress joint programme.

A critical study Off the Beat By Jake Fineman | StaffLast Updated 22 hours Ago Tweet Comment7 When I woke up last Thursday and learned that well-known far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos had been successfully repelled from our campus by protesters, I was at first seized with a buoyant, radical-leftist glee. “What a thrill it is to close off my mind to outside ideas, even if they are from violent white supremacists,” I exclaimed, fascistly. “Such joy fills me as I continue to shut myself off from the ‘real world’ and get brainwashed by evil liberal professors, who are probably also Jewish,” I proclaimed, as I defecated on a photograph of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. protesting nonviolently and being embraced by previously racist southerners. “At last, I am free from the critical thinking I surely would have been forced to experience by listening to this racist harass transgender students,” I shouted, joining my peers in metaphorically stabbing the Free Speech Movement and watching it bleed out on the steps of Sproul Plaza, just feet from where it had been birthed by known white supremacist apologist Mario Savio. But, just as my rapturous euphoria was reaching its peak, I was interrupted by an unpleasant thought: Am I not Berkeley’s foremost homosexual political troll? Do my flamboyant and disruptive ASUC-related antics presage a darker future? Is this my villain origin story? Am I … Milo Yiannopoulos? Though I was quickly able to reassure myself that I had not yet descended into full-blown Nazism, I know that for the layperson, the world of gay assholes can be difficult to penetrate. Therefore, dear reader, I invite you to join me on my journey of personal self-discovery. Like Milo, I achieved notoriety for my controversial opinions that were regularly published in a very powerful and influential publication. Milo is the tech editor for Breitbart News, the infamous far-right fake news generator that now controls the president of the United States. I am a former opinion columnist for The Daily Californian, the unpopular campus newspaper that controls people walking past a pile of today’s papers who think, “I’m not really doing anything right now.” However, Milo has used his platform to trumpet opinions that are Bad and Wrong, like the assertion that women who dare to express opinions about video games should be harassed off the internet. Conversely, my opinions are always Right and Awesome, like the assertion that ASUC senators who do not join me on my fruitless crusade to punish anti-queer chalkers should feel bad about themselves. Like Milo, I often dress flamboyantly for attention, pull stupid publicity stunts and am very gay in a way that my enemies find extremely irritating. Unlike Milo, I am enough of a critical thinker to make it through the mental gymnastics necessary to reach the conclusion that merely being gay is not enough to preclude being a traitor to the queer rights movement. I therefore will likely be less surprised than Milo when we are both shipped off to Vice Emperor Mike Pence’s conversion camps. Sad! Like Milo, I constantly have enormous and distracting bags under my eyes. But unlike Milo, I at least have the wherewithal not to have bleached tips. I have historically and consistently been against bleached tips; in fact, it was an important cornerstone of my ultimately unsuccessful 2015 campaign for ASUC president. I fervently pray that the American populace has not regressed enough to disagree with me on this point. Like Milo, my free speech rights have never been violated by a government entity. Milo was at no point stopped in his quest to directly target and harass students on campus by the campus administration, which claimed that defending those students would violate the principles of free speech, even though it is the explicit job of that administration to defend the safety and well-being of all its students. I was at no point stopped in my quest to write annoying opinions that nobody read every week, despite the fact that an actual sitting ASUC senator tried to get me fired for being too mean. But unlike Milo, I have a basic understanding of what free speech is and understand that a group of students exercising their right to assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances is not tantamount to the collapse of the republic. I also understand that the president of the United States threatening to retaliate against said assembling and petitioning actually is tantamount to the collapse of the republic. Like Milo, if you Google Image search “Milo Yiannopoulos,” my headshot comes up. Unlike Milo, you have to scroll down, like, four pages to find it. I guess I lose there. Finally, and perhaps most egregiously, Milo regularly refers to Trump as “Daddy.” I use “Daddy” as a term to refer only to people with whom I have a business arrangement to receive money, such as my biological father or other older partners of a decidedly different nature. I am fully confident that Donald Trump has never given Milo money as Trump is a well known con artist who never pays anybody unless he absolutely has to. So, am I Milo Yiannopoulos? I confidently assert that I am not … yet. So until a time when my popularity is boosted to “leading vast armies of sexually frustrated internet trolls” levels, I caution you that if you continue to feed my already-bloated ego, you do so at your own risk.

Trump needs re-election. xxoo thompson_richard Mark Morford has outdone Colbert & Meyers! But I’ll still be listening to their late night shows… they’re still very good!Thanks for sending fullest adjective-laden true scorn of Trump! JDAMTag > … even though it is the explicit job of that administration to defend the safety and well-being of all its students. < Well, there's a huge problem right there. "Defending the well-being of its students" seems too often means virtually shutting down or banning a lot of conservative speakers or expression. I understand WHY this is: many universities have a sweet racket going with the government. The government keeps extending credit to students to go to universities, and the universities, seeing this river of taxpayer-guaranteed loans, keeps raising tuition, books and fees. And those inexorably ratchet up student costs way out of proportion to the most bloated estimates of inflation. But the very BEST thing is, that while the taxpayers are on the hook for all the defaulted loans, the universities, whose administrators and faculties are very largely progressives and leftists, get 4 well-compensated years to indoctrinate the students into their progressive/leftist worldviews; and to that end; conveniently "defend' and protect them from speakers and information which run contra to their guiding ideology. I guess I could bottom line the whole sad operation as akin to an expensive post high-school education which hides a parasitic political brainwashing operation, The advantage to the students is that if they manage to nail down a degree in something the marketplace finds useful, there's some chance that they'll be able to pay those loans back. Oh, and thanks to being 'defended' from any "unsafe" views on campus , ( anything right of center) likely vote Democratic their entire lives, thus striving to guarantee the racket in perpetuity.

JotForm 4.0: The Must-Have Free Tool for Small Businesses Adnan Manzoor Entrepreneur & Blogger 11 Shares 11 SharesSHARES Share More Tweet Share Save Share Stumble Email JotForm 4.0: The Must-Have Free Tool for Small Businesses Adnan Manzoor Entrepreneur & Blogger | 11 Shares Nowadays, a business that does not have an online presence is doomed. The Internet has made it a lot easier for business owners to communicate with their customers and their prospects and to showcase their products or services. However, many web design softwares and services are expensive for small business. They’re also notoriously difficult and frustrating to use! One of the most common website issues that business owners are faced with is implementing forms on their websites. Businesses need forms of all kinds: contact forms, newsletter forms, order forms, and more. With little time to waste, small business owners need an easy and fast solution to making online forms. Luckily, there are free services such as online form building tool, JotForm, which nullifies this dilemma and makes it easier for businesses to implement free forms on their websites through the newest tool called JotForm 4.0 But let’s start at the beginning. What exactly is JotForm 4.0? JotForm is an online form builder and design tool that facilitates the process of integrating forms with one’s website, or as a standalone form. JotForm has been around since 2006, but recently it has been updated to offer more free features and ease of use. The latest version is even easier to use, more intuitive, and has new features, such as the ability to create forms on mobile devices. Why do I need forms on my website? Think of forms as managerial perks: They improve your communication with your clients. They collect vital data for your databases. They make it easier for people to contact you. They can help you get rid of an immense amount of customer emails and phone calls. They improve the accuracy of the data you receive. What do automated form builders offer? Apart from their unaltered simplicity, a form builder allows you to choose from a large range of templates, themes, and plugins. You can customize each of them according to your personal aesthetic taste. Plus, you can create any type of form that your website may need, from application, order and evaluation forms to registration, contact, feedback, abstract, event registration, request forms, and signup forms. 1. Ease of use With JotForm 4.0, you can create forms and have them up and running in just minutes. “Easy-to-use” is the unchanging, guiding principle of this platform. You don’t need to write a single line of code: the entire process is drag-and-drop! (Even professional web designers find it hard to integrate forms into the design of a website.) Sometimes, it can crack the entire framework of a website, so your site is rendered dysfunctional, which automatically means loss of money. Paying for expensive web design services for tasks like making online forms is unnecessary– you can do it yourself in a matter of minutes. 2. Beautiful designs Not only can you make your own forms with an online form builder, but you can also choose from a wide array of stunning designs. Or, upload your own images! Pro tip: Make sure that all customer-facing forms represent your company branding well. This includes having forms that feature your company colors, fonts, images, and logo. 3. Powerful apps and integrations JotForm offers over 100 integrations with business tools including Salesforce, Dropbox, PayPal, Excel, and more. For example, as your form submissions roll in, you can have their results automatically upload into an Excel or Google spreadsheet. Collect file uploads, add images, videos, calculators, and more! As you can see, an online form builder like JotForm 4.0 or even other paid forms builders can help you easily create forms and collect data on any device: desktop, tablet, or mobile phone. Final Thoughts Do your research. Hopefully, this article serves as a starting point in finding the perfect forms tool for you. While JotFrom 4.0 is a great tool, make sure to look into other form tools before making a final decision. Featured photo credit: Olu Eletu via unsplash.com Love this article?

Anna Fell/Murals Wallpaper The white, beige and grey backdrops of old are now throwing off the chains of blandness to become canvases for our imaginations to explore exciting new textures and colours ANYA GEORGIJEVIC Special to The Globe and Mail Last updated: Tuesday, Feb. 07, 2017 4:24PM EST Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Comments If you search a #homedecor hashtag on Instagram, you’ll scroll through a bevy of beautiful spaces, most of which have something in common: neutral walls. The ubiquitous backdrops in shades of white, beige, grey – or their hybrid, greige – have populated interior decor to the point where the desire against sameness has resulted in a wall-treatment revolution of sorts. From graphic wallpapers to sculptural wall panels to high-tech wonders, designers are looking for ways to introduce colour and texture into our interiors. “Walls are more than just spaces to fill. We are starting to see them more like canvases for our imagination,” says Carly Stojsic, a leading Canadian trend forecaster and former market editor at the Worth Global Style Network (WGSN). “We are looking at the most interesting surfaces that we can find right now.” Stojsic bids farewell to extreme minimalism that has been the prevailing trend of this decade in both design and fashion, in favour of “hyper-styled” visual collaging that is currently equated with luxury design. “Interior trends are often ignited by fashion design trends,” she explains, crediting Gucci’s Alessandro Michele for leading the consumer toward a fearless approach to print and colour. This design brings sharp colour to walls. Justina Blakeney/Hygge and West As with runways, exuberant prints are no strangers to design fairs, where new wallpaper companies are popping up along mainstay heritage brands such as Farrow & Ball. It’s a growing sector in product design. Among them is San Francisco-based Hygge & West, whose name comes from the Danish concept of hygge (pronounced hoo-ga), a decor trend du jour with an ethos in coziness. The small company works exclusively with independent artists and designers to create luxurious hand-screened wallpapers. One of them is Los Angeles-based designer Justina Blakeney, a blogger behind TheJungalow.com, whose motto “Decorate wild!” is an antithesis to Kinfolk magazine’s pared-down minimalist aesthetic. Blakeney’s penchant for tropical flora is a perfect companion to Greenery, Pantone’s 2017 colour of the year. The designer’s bold prints are available in solid sheets, as well as in the form of 24-by-32-inch (61-by-81-centimetre) removable wallpaper tiles that could be easily removed and reused – ideal for non-committal wallpaper enthusiasts. Wallpaper has come a long way since its creation in first-century China, when Ts’ai Lun invented papermaking from textile waste. Popularized in the Tudor era in the Western world, for centuries wallpaper was relegated to living areas as it was vulnerable to humidity in spaces such as kitchens and bathrooms. That’s not the case today. Italian wallpaper company Wall & Deco has pioneered Wet System, a patent-pending technical wall finishing for damp environments. They also offer Out System, a weather-proof system that allows the wallpaper to be applied outdoors, creating endless possibilities for exterior design. Taking things even further, Wall & Deco has used their designs for ceiling coverage, something Stojsic believes is greatly overlooked. “We see it happening in restaurants and retail, but we don’t do enough decoration in our own spaces.” Anna Fell./Murals Wallpaper Hygge takes on a different, more literal appearance in Murals Wallpaper’s Knit collection by designer Anna Fell. This larger-than-life, digitally printed wall treatment brilliantly fuses the aesthetic of Nordic design with the whimsical play on scale, creating a bit of a dollhouse illusion. The London-based company also made use of the current terrazzo trend and presented it in paper form. The bits of colourful “marble” floating on a solid surface recalls compositions of Memphis design, another recent comeback story (although they do have a collection dedicated to that as well). They also offer a range of marble and brick designs for fans of simulated texture. Those craving real texture can look to Muratto, a Portuguese-based brand specializing in natural-cork wall coverings. Muratto’s modular designs are a far cry from ordinary cork sheets draped on office walls, or the outgoing rustic trend of reclaimed and recycled materials. They take on shapes that mimic terra cotta, stone and metal. But it’s the Organic Blocks range that pushes the material in the most exciting way, creating soft wall sculptures with an undulating 3-D effect. New technologies are driving toward three-dimensionality in flat surface design. “Everything is so multisensory now, and it’s what gets traction,” says Stojsic, who believes that our walls will soon mimic our screens. At the 2015 International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York, Kyra and Robertson Hartnett, the duo behind printing studio twenty2, presented that sentiment with DEEP. This 3-D wallpaper collection, a result of four years of research in collaboration with Pratt Institute’s Sarah Strauss, consists of five patterns by five designers, from florals to graphic geometry to a seascape of sailing ships. It’s an illusion to be viewed with anaglyph 3-D glasses, but it helps, of course, that they also look beautiful without them. Black and white or grey-scale line drawings use the red and cyan offsets to create a 3-D effect, much like old 1980s comic books. The idea of experiencing one’s space through wearable technology is not so far-fetched in the era of rapid technological advances. A decade ago, London-based design sister duo Maria and Ekaterina Yaschuk of Meystyle created LED wallpaper, transforming walls into light structures. Given the longevity of LED lights, it’s more pragmatic than it sounds. In 2015, Google patented a technology that could turn walls into screens by using photo-reactive paint. The smart wall, controlled by a computer or a smartphone, could then take on any image just with a simple click. Stojsic sees these innovations as natural progression. “The digital space is something we will always want to surround ourselves with. That’s why materials that emulate, resemble or reflect the sentiments of the digital world – things that are glossy and imagined and lustrous and electric – are so interesting.” Whatever the future holds, plain walls do not apply. In the meantime, it’s all about having some fun. Report Typo/Error Next story | Learn More Discover content from The Globe and Mail that you might otherwise not have come across.
