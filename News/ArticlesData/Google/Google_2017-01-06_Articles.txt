Could this suggest higher-capacity models are in the pipeline?  ( Google ) Advertisement There's currently an on-going promotion on Verizon's listing for Google's self-branded flagships, the Pixel and the Pixel XL. But an interesting tidbit has been dug up recently, alluding to the availability of 256 GB Pixel and Pixel XL models in the pipeline from the Big Red. 256 GB Pixel And Pixel Models From Verizon? Users who clicked the "Learn More" button under Verizon's "Our best phones for as low as $10 [per] month" headline were taken to a table that lists 256 GB Pixel and Pixel XL models for $18.33 per month. However, the said models could have simply been a typographical error, since Verizon has seemingly reused the figures from the iPhone page. Simply put, Verizon probably wasn't able to edit the figures in order to fit the specifications of the Pixel and Pixel XL. Tough luck for those who desire for a Pixel handset with much beefier storage. As further proof, Droid Life was able to speak with a representative from Verizon who suggests that the listing may have just been a plain mistake, since there aren't currently 256 GB Pixel and Pixel XL model in the works, as far as the company is concerned. There goes your chance. Google Pixel And Pixel XL Specs The Pixel and the Pixel XL are Google's first phone after dropping the Nexus branding. Google bills it as the first Google-made phone from its roster, although much of its manufacturing was HTC's handiwork. The job order reportedly could have been Huawei's to fulfill, but it had a falling out with Google after encountering some differences. The two devices, boasting top-tier specs for a top-tier price, hold a minor disparities, predominantly with the display size. The base Pixel comes with a 5-inch AMOLED 1080p display, against the Pixel XL's 5.5-inch AMOLED Quad HD display. The two models' batteries also differ: the Pixel has a 2,770 mAh battery under the hood, while the Pixel XL boasts a significantly higher-capacity one at 3,450 mAh. Both of these batteries feature Quick Charge 3.0 support, and are non-removable. Both models use a 2.15 GHz 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip, partnered with an Adreno 530 GPU for graphics performance. Both handsets have 4 GB of DDR4 RAM and may come in 32 or 128 GB configurations, although there's no means to nudge the memory beyond that since the models don't support expandable storage. On the back is a 12.3-megapixel shooter that's scored the highest of any camera phone by DxOMark's standards. Meanwhile, on the front of both phones is an 8-megapixel camera. The rear shooter can record 4K video, while the front shooter can record 1080p video. The Pixel starts at $649 while the Pixel XL starts at a steep price of $769. Prices go up for 128 GB models, logically. The phones come in a few wackily named colors: Quite Black, Very silver, and Really Blue. Judging by their spec sheet alone, the Pixel handsets are quite excellent Android smartphones, although they're both not without their slew of problems. Is 128 GB not enough for the Pixel and the Pixel XL? Do you wish there was a 256 GB model, as well? Feel free to sound off in the comments section below.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Verizon-Verizon+ Android-Android+ Google-Google+ If you're a Verizon customer, you might be still waiting for the delivery of your 128GB Google Pixel XL. You might recall that Verizon has had trouble keeping this model of Google's first smartphone in stock. Today, one of our loyal readers told us about his order for the phone, which was made on November 26th of last year as part of Verizon's Black Friday sale. The original ship date for the phone was January 6th, which proves that our loyal reader has great patience to begin with. January 6th was yesterday, and instead of receiving his new Google designed, HTC built handset, he received an email telling him that the phone won't be shipped until March 3rd. And who knows if the phone will even be shipped then? We understand that the 128GB Pixel XL is very popular, and we get that delays can occur. But waiting an additional two months seems like a long time. Hopefully, Google and HTC can make up the backlog quicker than expected and ship our reader's 128GB Pixel XL ahead of the new shipping date. Otherwise, no one could blame him if he decided to switch to a different phone. 128GB Pixel XL, expected to ship January 6th, will not be in transit until March 3rd Thanks for sending this in!

Then again, it seems like an issue with VZW/Google. Google has always had these issues with their "factory" phones. posted on 08 Jan 2017, 07:39 1 in response to #25 in response to #25 Hide Reply 37. sgodsell (Posts: 3979; Member since: 16 Mar 2013) If you go to order it on Google's play store. Then it will about 2 weeks. So clearly this has something to do with Verizon. Maybe Verizon wants others to buy some other phones instead. Verizon might want users to buy a phone that is in their inventory. posted on 08 Jan 2017, 10:09 0 in response to #37 in response to #37 Hide Reply 39. 14545 (Posts: 1633; Member since: 22 Nov 2011) Good point. I didn't know that. Thanks for the info. It could be to try and push people that don't know better to the smaller "memory" devices and use the "unlimited cloud storage" to increase the chances of them using more data. I would honestly be ok if the carriers weren't allowed to sell/manage phones themselves since they are incentivized to lie and cost people more money in the long term. posted on 08 Jan 2017, 16:22 0 in response to #37 in response to #37 Hide Reply 50. bigdawg23 (Posts: 458; Member since: 25 May 2011) That's is the Standard Pixel. The Pixel XL 128GB has been out of stock in the Play Store for long time, so issue as VZW posted on 08 Jan 2017, 11:40 1 Reply 43. Scott93274 (Posts: 5130; Member since: 06 Aug 2013) No one ever says "fake demand", they say "artificial demand" as inventory is deliberately kept lower than projected sales. In the Case of the Pixel, this is the first time Google has released its own phone with this level of marketing, there are no past sales records to gauge how much stock they needed to be prepared to sell. Don't get me wrong, this is terribly unfortunate that they cannot meet the demand, though I'm sure it's nowhere near as high as the iPhone. I expect that with the Pixel 2, Google will ensure that they will be far better prepared to meet the demand. posted on 08 Jan 2017, 14:53 0 Reply 47. JackDiesel (Posts: 11; Member since: 03 Oct 2015) It's worst case scenario, I ordered one the day it came out and was supposed to be delivered on the 12th but Verizon f**ked up the address and it was returned to sender. So I ordered another one on the 12th and got it on the 28th. People are getting them way before the estimated ship date. posted on 08 Jan 2017, 15:25 0 in response to #47 in response to #47 Hide Reply 48. trojan_horse (Posts: 2492; Member since: 06 May 2016) "People are getting them way before the estimated ship date." But those people are obviously the minority... not the vast majority of those who pre-ordered the Pixel XL and still yet to get it. posted on 07 Jan 2017, 17:44 25 Reply 2.

I have also been waiting since that date and I received an email that looked just like that, only mine said March 10. Called Verizon yesterday and they said they don't make jokes like that in the title and the date hadn't changed yet. Also there is no account number in the email and all Verizon emails have the users account number in them. Did some research on the email it was sent from and apparently it is not Verizon sending them. You have to contact them and tell them to check their account before it's hacked! posted on 08 Jan 2017, 00:34 3 Reply 31. Tizo101 (Posts: 505; Member since: 05 Jun 2015) the quality of stories on this site is distasteful. The other day they posted a story about a horribly scratched iPhone 7 plus and quickly removed it but now they are reporting on fake emails and the story remains because it's Google. posted on 08 Jan 2017, 11:15 0 Reply 41.

I just hope that they learn from this mistake and prepare for the Pixel 2 as I plan to get that device. Crossing my fingers for Tango support. It would be a stellar feature/upgrade that very few other phones offer and something Apple won't have for a long time coming if at all. posted on 07 Jan 2017, 18:21 3 Reply 13.

Jealous that Pixel owners get to have all the VR fun? Pick up one of these newly compatible Android smartphones and you'll be Daydreamin' in no time. Josh Miller/CNET Phones by Gordon Gottsegen January 7, 2017 1:27 PM PST Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS When Google revealed its Daydream View in October, it was announced alongside the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. These two "phones by Google" and headset were a match made in VR heaven in some ways, but that also meant you could only experience Daydream by using a Pixel. After that, Google added compatibility to the Moto Z. Now it's expanding the list of Daydream-compatible phones a bit more with the Huawei Mate 9 Pro, Asus ZenFone AR and ZTE Axon 7. If you're in the market for a Daydream phone, you have a few options to choose from. The six compatible phones bring different things to the table. For example, the Pixel phones will automatically get the latest Android updates as they're made available, while the Moto Z has the option to attach Moto Mod accessories. The three new phones offer their own unique features, like the dual cameras in the Mate 9 Pro, the dual SIM in the Axon 7 or Tango AR compatibility in the ZenFone AR. So which phone you pick depends on the features you want -- and the price, of course. Luckily CNET's got your back and came up with the following chart for easy side-by-side comparison.

Advertisement Earlier this year, Google released an Android Nougat Developer Preview, a beta that allowed anyone with a compatible device to test the update ahead of its public release. The Android 7.0 Nougat beta delivered new and important features but it also caused problems for us and many other Nexus users. In August, Google released the final version of the Nexus Android 7.0 Nougat update. And while the beta wiped out some of these problems, Nexus users are complaining about various issues with the new operating system. As we push deeper into the fall, we’re learning about the Android 7.0 Nougat problems plaguing owners of Nexus smartphones and tablets. Advertisement In response, we’ve put together a roundup that looks at these Nexus Android 7.0 problems, potential fixes for the most common Nougat issues, some places to go if you need to find feedback about the Android 7.0 Nougat update on your device, and what you can expect from the first bug fix update. We will continue to update this with new information so check back for regular updates about problems, fixes and more. How to Prepare for Android 7.0 Nougat Now that Android 7.0 Nougat is out, it’s going to be tempting to make the move from Marshmallow to Nougat. That said, before you make the move to Google’s new operating system, you’ll want to make sure that you’ve prepared. It’s extremely difficult to predict what you might run into after you install Android 7.0 Nougat on your Nexus phone or tablet. It could be flawless, you could see a dramatic drop in performance. It’s impossible to say. So, you’ll want to take a few minutes to prepare. Advertisement You’ll want to take a look at the step-by-step through the process we use before we install an Android update. A little prep work will go a long way toward preventing serious issues. Take your time with Android 7.0 Nougat. It’s not going anywhere. Android 7.0 Nougat Problems The Android 7.0 Nougat update is a solid upgrade for Nexus smartphones and tablets but it’s far from perfect. Android 7.0 Nougat problems feature the usual complaints about the installation process. A number of users have experienced issues side-loading the new software. This is a common complaint. If you’re having issues, take a look at our guide. It’ll walk you through the process. Nexus 5X owners are reporting boot loops after installing Android 7.0 Nougat. However, Google is claiming that it’s a hardware problem and not a software problem which means it likely won’t be able to fix the issue with an update. It appears that the only solution, at least for right now, is to get in contact with the retailer and ask for a replacement. We’re also seeing complaints about busted/sound speakers, various performance issues including lag, abnormal battery drain, issues with Wi-Fi, issues with Bluetooth, problems moving from the Developer Preview, problems with various applications and Google Now, and more. Those merely scratch the surface. Hi @google and @Android the new #Nougat update keeps cutting out #Bluetooth on my #car. I love my nexus 6p, but this is terrible 😔 😢 — Jim E (@Jimb0x) August 23, 2016 Isn't battery life suppose to be better on wifi.. on nougat it's worse 🤔 — Jeremy (@jjcollins15) August 26, 2016 First silly little bug in @Android Nougat. Notification is blank when there actually *is* a notification there. pic.twitter.com/ExBEepUlqb — Sankalp (@sankalp_sans) August 27, 2016 Android 7.0 Nougat little icon bug on my 6P. I guess I have super ultra bluetooth @googlenexus pic.twitter.com/gN2W0CIwWp — Sebastien Fey ⭐️ (@jsfey) August 26, 2016 I'm having a problem with @BBM since updating my Nexus 6P to Nougat. Error writing file when anyone sends me any file/voice @BlackBerryHelp — Adam (@Massonite) August 26, 2016 The good news is that we haven’t (at least not yet) heard about any widespread Nexus Android 7.0 Nougat problems. That could, of course, change at a moment’s notice so you’ll want to be extremely careful with your device and this update. Where to Find Android 7.0 Feedback As we move away from Google’s Android 7.0 Nougat release date, you’ll want to keep tabs on performance. Doing this will alert you to potential Android 7.0 Nougat problems on your device. And if you’re on the fence about installing Android 7.0 on your phone or tablet, it’ll help you get to one side of the fence or the other. Most of you will probably wind up installing Nougat on your Nexus device but it might be wise to get a second opinion before you do so. We recently dug into the Nexus 5X Android 7.0 Nougat update so that’s a great place to start if you’re looking for feedback about the update’s general performance . There are a number of other resources out there. We’re starting to see feedback go up on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook, Google’s Nexus Help forums, XDA-Developers, YouTube, and Android-centric forums like Android Central forums. If you’re dealing with Android 7.0 Nougat problems or you’re worried about the potential for Nougat problems on your device, dig into the feedback there. How to Fix Android 7.0 Nougat Problems If you’re already experiencing an Android 7.0 problem on your device or if you simply want to prepare ahead of your Android 7.0 update, you’ll want to take a look at our list of fixes for common Nexus Android 7.0 Nougat issues. Our list includes potential fixes for Wi-Fi problems, Bluetooth issues, and other bugs that typically pop up after a major Nexus update release. We’ve also put together another guide that will show you how to fix Nexus Android 7.0 Nougat battery life problems. These fixes for Nexus Android problems have worked for many people in the past but they aren’t guaranteed to work on your phone or tablet. If you can’t find a fix there, take at Google’s Nexus Help Forums. There are some very knowledgeable and polite Nexus users located there. If not there, head over to XDA-Developers, or your favorite Android-centric forum for other potential remedies. What’s Next In its August Android 7.0 Nougat announcement, Google told Nexus owners it had already started work on the next major Android Nougat update. At the time, it didn’t confirm the version. Now we know that update is Android 7.1. Before its official release in December (for the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, and Pixel C), Google’s released an Android 7.1 Developer Preview for the Nexus 6P, Pixel C, and Nexus 5X.G The Android 7.1 Developer Preview is now available to those who are enrolled in Google’s Android Beta program. If you are experiencing major issues on Android 7.0 or if you’re curious about Android 7.1’s performance, you might consider installing this preview. Betas typically aren’t good alternatives to official software but there’s a chance you’ll see some improvements with Android 7.1 on board. The next three quarterly maintenance releases of Android Nougat will be Android 7.1 / 7.1.1 / 7.1.2 — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 28, 2016 The Android 7.1 Nougat change log for older Nexus devices isn’t confirmed but we expect it to come with some crucial bug fixes for Android Noguat problems. Android 7.1 will also come with some brand new features. Google will also continue to roll out its monthly security updates though you can’t rely on those to bring bug fixes for Nougat problems. Keep an eye out for details about security updates and the next Nougat update as we into the month of November. 9 Things to Do Before Installing Android 7.1.1 Nougat Get Familiar with Android 7.1.1 Nougat   1 / 9 One of the first things you'll want to do before installing Android 7.1.1 Nougat is to get familiar with the update. Blindly installing Android 7.1.1 Nougat on your device is a bad idea, particularly for novice Android users. If you haven't been following the Developer Preview, now would be a great time to get acquainted with Android 7.1.1 and its various changes. There are many. Some are big and obvious. Others are much smaller and harder to locate.  We've put together a guide that will walk you through Android 7.1.1 Nougat versus Android 7.0 Nougat and Android Marshmallow. If you're coming to 7.1.1 from Android 7.0 Nougat or Marshmallow, and we assume most of you are, this will come in handy.  Google's also outlined many of the update's key ingredients and you can take a look at those right here and right here.  It's in your benefit to dig into the update prior to installing it. This way, you won't be caught off guard by any of the changes.    1 / 9 18 Responses 09/12/2016 Patricia Heil (@PatTheTerrible) Reply My Nougat upgrade seems to have gone very well. I read your article on battery life problems and for a newbie like me, it’s too hard to figure out the more extreme fixes. The easy ones I’ve pre-empted by not running some of those apps. Also, the check on battery draining apps showed NO apps in the list. Weird. It’s a Nexus 5X in case that’s important. I’m enjoying it, the camera app is great and the audio is fair. Thanks for the info. 10/21/2016 Dakota Bastow (xScottyMcGee) Reply I find this all really interesting. My update has been flawless. And if anything my battery life has improved! 09/12/2016 Patricia Heil (@PatTheTerrible) Reply There you are, as Catwoman said to Batman. I have Android System, not OS as you warned, using 1-2% of the battery. 09/24/2016 Gary SainTamey Reply I’ll probably wait a bit after new Android Nougat is released to public. No rush,my older Nexus 7-2013]tablet has ALWAYS updated with NO problems in the past, will let some of the bugs get fixed, might update in 90days,etc..no worries.. “IF” Android OS was on a laptop, I’d buy one asap, it’s been the easiest to learn, easiest to update and makes OSX or Windows seem SO outdated and difficult in comparison! 09/27/2016 Nate paul Reply Android is on laptops they have the highest market share. 09/25/2016 keithalanfisher Reply This article is completely useless to me. My problem has been applications routinely stopping on open. They restart as expected but I’m usually torturing Google with “stoppage” feedback, in which I continually imply my Nexus 5X is constipated with nougat. I have seen quick battery drain. Be mindful of Wi-Fi being on but not connected to any network. And sadly, I think, using a Nexus 5X as a Hotspot is a disaster waiting to happen, even before Nougat arrived. If you bought a Speck case, remove it when using Wi-Fi as a Hotspot. The battery gets way too hot and my unit has shut down in the past to preserve itself. (I guess you gotta give LG/Google credit for hardware design that won’t allow your smartphone to melt.) 09/25/2016 Michael Caley Reply Since Nougat is not out for my Nexus 6, I was running preview 5 which seemed ok, but switched back to 6.0.1 with xposed and gravity box and elemental x runs real well. 09/27/2016 ˈÄrkän ˈSābər Reply I did the same here. I rolled back to Marshmallow 6.0.1 after trying Nougat Dev Preview 5 on the Nexus 6. I’m not rushing to install the Final Build. Surprisingly, the Nexus 9 got the OTA Nougat Final Build. No issues so far. Like you said. I might as well put on xPosed, Gravity Box & Elemental X while waiting. CyanogenMod seems to be pushing CM14 quickly enough that I might skip the Nexus factory images altogether. 10/04/2016 FanDroid Reply Are the users having issues using OTA or factory update? * With major OS upgrades, I HIGHLY recommend doing factory install * After install completes, do a Recover Mode –> Factory Data Wipe. Any time I’ve had issues flashing, doing a factory wipe *most often* fixes most issues. 10/04/2016 Michael James Gibbons Reply Wow what a terribly written article. Took forever to even start mentioning what the issues are then was completely vague and disorganised about that. Try proof reading please 10/04/2016 FanDroid Reply It’s out now :-) Nexus 6: factory image https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/shamu-nbd90z-factory-92e7bb05.zip 10/04/2016 FanDroid Reply Have you tried doing Factory Data Wipe since you updated? 10/12/2016 Alexandra Adina Reply Completely useless article. 10/21/2016 Travis Coble Reply I just updated to 7.1… And while it adds some VERY nice new features, I’m having one huge brand new issue: CANNOT SIDELOAD APKS! 😣 10/21/2016 AD Reply So much bs mulling over the same point over and over again just to make the article longer. Article is overly stuffed with keywords, which makes it annoying to read. The whole point could be made in few concise sentences.. 1. Users report long installation times, boot loops, worsen battery longevity.. 2. Here are few tips to fix / workaround it (click this other ad-filled link) 3. Don’t forget about Dev Preview available to Android beta users, if you want bleeding edge 7.1, etc.. 10/21/2016 Mjt Reply No problems on the Nexus 6 with stock or with EX kernel. Battery life has been great. 11/08/2016 Marc Louie Yap Reply Fixed all problems by doing a factory reset. Camera performance improved, battery life improved, image quality in HDR mode improved.. 01/07/2017 Rosetta Reply Call Nexus support and they will extend your warranty! Just tell them about your circumstance that your nexus is stuck in a boot loop because of the Nougat update. I got my warranty extended just now! Yay! finally somewhat resolved!

Just ask anyone: “Alexa Just Conquered CES. The World Is Next,” read one Wired headline. CNBC, the BBC, MIT Technology Review, and many others all had equally laudatory reports. Companies like Ford, Huawei, LG, as well as a long parade of startups, all unveiled home appliances, phones, cars, and more gadgets with Alexa integration. It’s a reflection of the sheer power that Amazon is starting to wield in the nascent smart home market, as a growing number of people come to rely on their Echo devices to run their homes and to automate their lives. The market for the Echo is still small compared to smartphones, but it’s growing fast. Google already has the Google Home, its own voice-enabled speaker, designed to compete with the Amazon Echo. Microsoft partnered with Harmon to bring its Cortana virtual assistant to a smart speaker. Even Apple is rumoured to be working on a dedicated Siri speaker. But so far Amazon is the smart speaker to beat, with an early start and plenty of buzz. Business InsiderLeft to right: The Amazon Echo Dot, Echo Tap, and Echo devices all make Alexa available via voice commands. More importantly though, the rise of the Echo heralds a changing tech landscape that could spell big trouble for Google. No matter how many Google Home devices the search giant sells, Google will be playing on a field that’s tilted in Amazon’s favour. The rise of Alexa A big part of Amazon’s early success with Alexa is due to the fact that the company didn’t oversell it. After years of iPhone users getting let down by Siri, the first truly mainstream voice agent, Amazon billed the Echo as a speaker that, by the way, has a few smart voice commands built in. Then, just as people got accustomed to the idea of talking to Alexa, and positive word of mouth spread, Amazon added more capabilities. Alexa now boasts thousands of “skills” that allow it to connect with apps like Uber, Twitter, and Bloomberg news. That’s helped Alexa and the Echo speaker earn a position as the central hub in so-called smart homes. Alexa’s voice-first interface is the perfect way to manage internet-connected lights, door locks, and thermostats — it’s way more intuitive than having to pull out a tablet or phone every two seconds. BI Intelligence But here’s the crucial part. The Echo also makes it super-easy to buy stuff, specifically stuff from Amazon. Alexa can play music from streaming services like Spotify, but it defaults to using Amazon’s own Prime Music, which is a pretty key feature for a smart speaker. It’s yet another reason for consumers to get a $99/year Amazon Prime subscription…which also gets you free shipping from Amazon, which encourages you to buy more from Amazon. In other words, whatever else it does, the Amazon Echo is designed to make it easier for you to give more of your money to Amazon. And that slick voice interface for “skills” and for controlling all of your smart home gear ensures that you’re always using the Echo and Alexa. It’s pretty genius, in a diabolical way. Versus Google This is where things get bad for Google. The more Alexa devices that Amazon and its partners sell, the better Amazon does at its core retail business. Every Echo is a customer who is more likely to spend more on books, groceries, music, and movies. Consider Google’s position, though. It can sell as many Google Home devices as it wants. And it’s true that Google is better at search than Amazon, by a country mile. But Google is a search advertising company, not a retail company, and those Google Home devices aren’t delivering ads. (Can you imagine if they did? “OK Google, open the garage door.” “OK, Matt, but listen to this ad for Mailchimp first.”) GoogleGoogle Home Sure Google can use all the data it collects through its Google Home speaker to refine the ads people see on its search engine. But the point is that consumers will be spending less time in front of screens and looking at Google’s search ads. No matter how good Google’s search ads are, it doesn’t matter if people aren’t seeing them. In fact, we’re already seeing some of this: Amazon is beating Google in the vital area of e-commerce search, because Amazon is the go-to destination for buying things. And thanks to the popularity of Amazon’s Alexa, that’s likely to continue. Voice technology is still in its very early stages, and smartphones aren’t going away anytime soon. And none of this is to say that Google’s problems are insurmountable. It wasn’t so long ago that investors were convinced that Facebook couldn’t monetise its mobile app. Today, Facebook is one of the primary mobile ad platforms. Google could certainly pull off a similar coup. But the direction in which computing is moving is clear, and as things stand now, Google’s weakness looks like Amazon’s strength. And with Alexa on the rise, the clock is ticking for Google.

(Jack Dempsey/AP Images for LG Electronics) | Caption Julia Love Reuters January 7, 2017 Las Vegas—Amazon.com Inc's digital assistant appeared almost everywhere at the CES technology show this week in Las Vegas, even making an unexpected appearance on rival Google's Android system. Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp to Ford Motor Co unveiled products featuring Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon that responds to voice commands. Most strikingly, Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co , which manufactures smartphones running on the Android operating system produced by Alphabet Inc's Google, announced that its flagship handset will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States. The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos told Walt Mossberg at the Recode conference that Alexa would be the "fourth pillar" of the company's business.  Inventions that were going to change the world – but didn’t Many in the technology industry believe that such voice-powered digital assistants will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way consumers interact with devices. While the shift is only in the early stages, Google must establish a strong presence quickly, particularly on Android devices, to maintain its dominance in internet search, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google's voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that's a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue," he said. Alexa debuted on the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and Amazon is establishing a broad array of hardware and software partnerships around it. The competing Google Assistant launched last year on the company's Pixel smartphone, after appearing on Google's messaging app, and has begun to roll out to third-party devices as well. Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp announced at CES that its Shield television will feature the assistant. While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said. "It highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services," he said. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign-Up × As The Christian Science Monitor reported, Ford is likely to be the first US carmaker to debut Alexa this summer. But writer Ben Rosen notes that most new vehicles today have software that connects to a smartphone and allows drivers to place phone calls or dictate texts hands free. Carmakers have gradually been improving these features to offer drivers more convenience as well as combat distracted driving. But some transportation safety experts and advocacy groups warn that such technology isn’t necessarily safer. Voice commands might keep drivers’ hands on the wheel and eyes on the road. But prompting, say, Apple’s Siri or Amazon's Alexa can be just as mentally distracting to drivers. They say it is up to both drivers and the auto industry to realize this technology should improve driving first, and add convenience and entertainment to the driving experience second. “If you start composing tweets while you’re driving, that’s a cognitive distraction. It’s not going to help you control, guide, or navigate the vehicle,” says David Hurwitz, an associate professor of transportation engineering at Oregon State University. “The more functionality we add to vehicles, the greater potential we add for in-vehicle distraction. That’s concerning. We need to think about that more.” While Amazon has a head start, Google is no by no means out of the race, given the strength of its internet search technology. The Google Assistant can already field queries that Alexa cannot, said Sergei Burkov, chief executive of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company. "A huge part of an assistant is search," he said. "Google is a search company. Amazon is not."

Happy new year! We hit the ground running this week at the CES tech industry expo, where there were some truly exciting announcements… and one or two unexpected curiosities. If you’ve struggled to keep up with it all, fear not, for 7 Days is back after a short festive break, and here to guide you through the top stories from CES, and across the wider tech world. Let’s waste no more time – there’s a lot to get through! Our journey begins this week in the world of healthcare, as researchers have developed a new computer algorithm that can help to diagnose conditions such as ADHD and autism. Meanwhile, over in the UK, the National Health Service is testing an app powered by artificial intelligence that can offer medical advice to patients based on the symptoms they describe. Almost four months after its release, Apple revealed that iOS 10 is now installed on 76% of active iOS devices. The first iOS 10.3 beta is expected to arrive next week, with a mysterious new ‘Theatre Mode’. A video published on Friday gave us our first look at an early prototype of an iPod-based operating system developed by Apple for its original iPhone, including a virtual touchscreen scroll wheel. Frankly, it looks pretty awful, so it’s a huge relief that they ended up chucking it in the bin. Intel formally launched its new 7th-generation Core vPro processors, which it says will offer greatly improved security features and… “50% increased productivity over a 5-year-old PC”. Wow? The company also touted the prowess of its consumer-class 7th-gen (Kaby Lake) Core processors, and outlined its hopes for the virtual reality market, saying that it expects 2017 to be a big year for VR. Qualcomm announced its Snapdragon 835 chipset, which features new optimizations for virtual and augmented reality scenarios. The powerful new SoC will launch on flagship-class devices in the next few months, promising 25% less power consumption, Quick Charge 4 support, and more. Nvidia officially announced its anticipated GTX 1050 and 1050Ti graphics cards for laptops, promising powerful performance for budget-conscious buyers. Nvidia also revealed a new Shield TV streaming device with 4K and HDR support. The device includes voice control features and support for Google Assistant. Google revealed that it’s bringing its digital Assistant to Android TV devices running both 6.0 Marshmallow and 7.0 Nougat. Google said it received a massive one billion takedown requests for its search engine in 2016 – twice the amount it got the year before. It looks like Google may finally be preparing to bring its YouTube Red subscription service to European markets this year. And at long last, it seems Google is getting ready to roll out Android 7.1.1 Nougat to the Nexus 6, over a month after its release for other devices. The company also released its January security updates for Android this week. Samsung began rolling out Android 7.0 to a very limited number of its Galaxy S7 handsets on Wednesday. And with just a few hours of 2016 remaining, OnePlus made good on its promise to release its Android 7.0 upgrade to its 3 and 3T flagships before the end of the year. OnePlus delivering an update on time… is that a first? Following the recent collapse of Cyanogen, British device manufacturer Wileyfox said that it will replace Cyanogen OS on its handsets with a ‘pure’ Android experience. A photo showing a slide presented at a Nokia event revealed the company’s plans to launch as many as seven Android smartphones by the end of 2017. The slide proudly declared “The Empire Strikes Back”... consequently reminding everyone that Nokia’s empire, and its share price, have crumbled over the last decade. On Saturday, a leaked image purportedly revealed key specs of the 'Nokia 6', one of the first Android smartphones on the way. BlackBerry is another fallen mobile empire that’s trying to rise again by licensing its brand to another company to build Android devices. This week, TCL showed off its new BlackBerry phone with a QWERTY keyboard – and then said it wouldn’t talk about it until February, by which time everyone will have completely lost interest. Great strategy. LG revealed a change of strategy for its new G6 flagship phone, confirming that it’s ditching the modular design of its current G5, which has been a sales flop. Xiaomi unveiled a white version of its Mi MIX ‘concept’ device… …while Huawei’s Honor brand showed off its new Magic concept device in the flesh – and we managed to get our hands on it. Honor also announced the launch of its ‘mid-range flagship’, the 6X, in the US and Europe. Huawei brought its Mate 9 flagship to the US too, priced at $599, and revealed that it will add support for Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant later this year. ZTE revealed its new upper-mid-range handset, the Blade V8 Pro, with a Snapdragon 625 processor, 3GB RAM, 32GB storage, 13MP camera, USB Type-C port, and more. Check out our hands-on first impressions of the device here. Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy A series handsets – and as rumored, they all include IP68 dust- and water-resistance. That’s a very nice addition to the mid-range devices. After the disastrous launch, and subsequent global recall, of its Galaxy Note7 flagship, Samsung said that it will reveal the findings of its investigation into the battery fires that plagued the device “later this month”. Image: All About Windows Phone But it looks like Samsung’s next flagship, the Galaxy S8, will include a rather intriguing feature. An image revealed the company’s plans to introduce a “desktop experience” to the new Android device with support for an external monitor, mouse and keyboard – which sounds rather a lot like the Continuum mode in Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile. Microsoft was planning to release a new Fast ring preview of its Windows 10 Creators Update this week, but those plans were postponed while the company addresses some issues with the update process. However, Windows 10 Enterprise build 15002 – believed to be the same build that was due for release – leaked onto the web late on Friday night. However, Microsoft did officially roll out Windows 10 build 14393.594 (Anniversary Update) to PCs and phones in the Release Preview ring. Microsoft hasn’t officially provided a firm launch date for the Creators Update, saying only that it will be released in “early 2017”. But Dell let the cat out of the bag this week, confirming that the Creators Update is due to roll out in April. The Creators Update will include support for 802.11ad Wi-Fi, and wireless docking support for that protocol will be added in a future update. Image: MSPoweruser After the Creators Update, the Redstone 3 update is expected to arrive towards the end of the year. That update will include changes to the user interface, developed under the codename ‘Project Neon’ – and the first screenshots previewing Windows 10’s design refresh leaked on Thursday, showing a cleaner, less cluttered look with new blurring and transparency effects. Microsoft promised more transparency and new insights into its Windows 10 development process this year, as it launched a new blog focused on the Windows Insider community. Elsewhere, Microsoft hit back at inaccurate media reports (not from Neowin!), which claimed that it’s killing off its Command Prompt in the Windows 10 Creators Update. In fact, it’s prioritizing its more versatile PowerShell command line experience over the antiquated Command Prompt, but the latter will still remain in the OS. Data from NetMarketShare revealed that Windows 10 is now installed on almost a quarter of PCs, with Windows 7 approaching 50%, and macOS X 10.11 on 4.38%. On the Steam gaming platform, Windows 10 is now in use by more than half of all gamers, 17 months after its launch. Meanwhile, Microsoft appears to be working on a new cross-platform media-sharing service, currently known as ‘Belize’. Microsoft has been working with numerous automotive giants in recent months to establish its products at the heart of their connected car strategies. BMW, for example, unveiled its vision for self-driving cars with Cortana support, while Nissan is also among other major manufacturers to be working with Microsoft and its Connected Vehicle Platform. Audi has teamed up with Nvidia on its self-driving car program, in an effort to infuse more of its vehicles with autonomous control technologies powered by artificial intelligence. Mmm buzzwords. Casio was among the many companies attending CES this week, revealing a new $500 Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch. Take a look at our hands-on impressions of the rugged wearable device. But it was the giants of the tech industry that made some of the biggest announcements in the greatest numbers. Dell was among them, unveiling a series of new devices, including the Inspiron 7000 gaming laptops with Nvidia's latest GTX 1050 GPUs… …and the Latitude 5285 and Latitude 7285 – two new business-class Windows 10 2-in-1s, promising exceptional security and versatility. The latter device also offers wireless charging support. Dell also unveiled a new XPS 13 2-in-1, and the 27 Ultrathin Monitor… …as well as the stunning UltraSharp 8K Monitor – the first commercially available monitor with 8K resolution, and an unsurprisingly high price tag. But most excitingly, Dell also revealed the XPS 27 all-in-one PC, and the Canvas – an intriguing new competitor to Microsoft’s new Surface Studio. Stardock announced that it has been working with Dell on an exclusive version of its desktop organization suite, Fences, for the new Canvas PC. Don’t miss our hands-on first impressions of Dell’s new devices here! HP unveiled the second generation of its unusual Sprout Pro Windows 10 PC, which has an integrated projector and touch-mat, along with 2D and 3D scanning capabilities. Of course, we went hands-on to see what all the fuss was about – you can see it in action in our videos here. HP’s new ENVY Curve AIO 34 all-in-one PC also made its debut at CES, along with the OMEN X 35 curved monitor. And the 15.6-inch HP Spectre x360 and EliteBook x360 also made their first appearance at the show, both with 4K displays. We went hands-on with both devices here, so make sure you check that out! Lenovo also had plenty of announcements at CES, including that of its new Smart Assistant, an Amazon Echo-style speaker... powered by Amazon’s Alexa assistant. Lenovo unveiled three new ThinkPad X1 devices, and the Miix 720 – a high-end Surface Pro-style tablet, including an integrated rear kickstand. Check out our hands-on videos and photos of those new devices here, along with our impressions of the Smart Assistant. Two Lenovo gaming laptops were announced too, kicking off the company’s new line of Legion gaming PCs. Lenovo launched its new 500 Multimedia Controller, a $55 wireless keyboard for media PCs, on which the keys also double up as a capacitive touchpad with support for Windows 10 gestures. Last month, Microsoft revealed new information on its plans with hardware partners to launch more affordable virtual reality headsets powered by its Windows Holographic shell on Windows 10. Lenovo showed off its VR headset at CES, and said it will launch later this year for under $400. We also got a look at new Windows Holographic VR headsets from HP, Dell and others. CES played host to the rise of the machines, as many companies showed off home robots at the event. The cute new Kuri robotic companion is now available to pre-order for $699. LG also displayed a range of new robots, destined for both home and commercial use. LG announced its new family of thin and light Windows 10 notebooks, claiming that they offer up to 24 hours of battery life… but we’ll have to put that claim to the test in the real world before we can believe it. The LG Stylo 3 and 3 Plus made an appearance too. The two lower-mid-range handsets each have an integrated stylus and come with Android 7.0. Lots of manufacturers revealed new TVs at CES, and LG was no exception. Its range of 4K TVs come with ‘Nano Cell’ technology, said to offer superior color and clarity from any viewing angle. And like so many other devices at CES, LG’s new smart refrigerator includes Amazon Alexa voice support, along with a 29-inch touchscreen and internal camera. Samsung also introduced a new range of smart fridges, including models with a 21.5-inch touchscreen, and its new Family Hub 2.0 software. The Samsung Notebook Odyssey was revealed as the company’s first gaming laptop, featuring some rather meaty specs… and a rather ugly trackpad design. Bleugh. Pre-orders also opened for Samsung’s new Notebook 9, which it calls “the lightest notebook on the market”. Samsung believes its new ‘QLED TVs’ have what it takes to crush all of their rivals, thanks to their use of Quantum Dot technology. Image: Bloomberg Sony made quite an impression with its new ultra-thin BRAVIA OLED TV range, available in three sizes up to 77 inches. They won’t come cheap, so you’d better start saving and/or selling some body organs if you’re thinking of buying one. Xiaomi’s new TVs are also incredibly thin – but they’re rather interesting for another reason too. They have a modular design, which will allow owners to upgrade them in the future by adding new components. Asus revealed new displays designed for computing. It introduced a pro-grade 32-inch 4K monitor with HDR support, along with an enormous 37.5-inch curved ultra-wide monitor, featuring ‘frameless bezels’, and integrated Qi wireless charging plate. Asus also unveiled the ZenFone AR, the first phone in the world to support both Google’s Tango augmented reality suite, and the Daydream virtual reality platform. There’s no doubting the fact that it’s got some pretty decent specs – but it’s not exactly attractive. Miraxess is preparing to launch a new laptop-style phone dock for Android and Windows 10 Mobile devices, similar to the $599 HP Lap Dock for its flagship-class Elite x3 handset. However, the Mirabook will cost half that amount. Meanwhile, Brydge revealed its new laptop-style aluminum keyboard for Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 tablet. There seemed to be no end of PCs on display at CES this year, so it was certainly appropriate that Endless attended the event to unveil its simple, affordable mini-PCs, priced from $129. And after announcing the Sirius A in October, Ockel showed up at CES ready to show off the curious mini-PC in the flesh. The device has a 6-inch touchscreen, but runs the full version of Windows 10 Home, and has an integrated DisplayPort, full-size HDMI, two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, one USB 3.0 Type C port and a full-size Ethernet port too. More photos and details of the Sirius A and Ockel’s other mini-PCs can be found here. Toshiba turned up with a far more conventional Windows 10 device. Its new Portégé X20W notebook is a 2-in-1 that promises up to 16 hours of battery life. Acer showed off a range of new notebooks and desktops too – but the star of its show stand was the mighty Predator 21 X gaming notebook that it announced in August. The monstrous machine – which has a curved 21-inch display – finally got a price tag… and it’s enormous. Not to be outdone, Razer turned up to CES with an even crazier device. Project Valerie is a gloriously insane notebook with three (!!!) built-in displays, each with 4K resolution, powered by a desktop-class Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. Mad. Quite mad. Razer also took things to a whole new level with the unveiling of its Project Ariana concept, a room-scale projector that aims to turn gaming into a truly immersive experience. Back on Planet Earth, Sony revealed that it has now sold an impressive 53.4 million PlayStation 4 consoles since its launch in 2013, including 6.2 million in just six weeks over the holiday season. Despite being outsold by the PS4, Microsoft nonetheless celebrated its Xbox achievements in 2016, and promised an even more exciting year ahead for its gaming platform. But this week’s odyssey around the tech world ends, appropriately, at CES, where the L’Oreal/Withings smart hairbrush won an innovation award. All hope is lost. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. I looked back on a remarkable year for Microsoft, in which it became one of the world's most exciting tech companies. I also took a look ahead to what's in store for Microsoft in 2017 - from gaming and new devices, to productivity and mixed reality, it's set to be a year of work, play, and creativity unleashed for the company. Vlad Dudau shared a mini-review of the MGCool Band 2, an ultra-affordable fitness tracker with some very nice features... but there's certainly room for improvement. And Christopher White published his detailed review of the Thecus W2810PRO, a NAS (network attached storage) device running Windows Storage Server 2012 R2 Essentials. Who comes up with these names? Anyway, the W2810PRO earned itself a very good score in the review, but there are still a few downsides to be aware of. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend and a very happy new year!

Advertisement Android 7.0 Nougat is loaded with new features, improved battery life, multi-window mode and more. Nexus and Pixel owners have been enjoying it for some time, and now it’s OnePlus’ turn. The company announced the beta is over, and the stable release is rolling out now to kick off 2017. Read: Android 7.1 Nougat vs Android 6.0: What’s New The Android N developer test ended in August and was quickly released for select devices. There are beta programs from LG, Samsung, Sony and more. Earlier this year we learned the OnePlus 3 Nougat beta was coming in November. Now after two months of testing, it’s ready for all users. Read on for more details. Advertisement Advertisement Popular smartphones from all major manufacturers will see a free update to Android 7.0 Nougat or Android 7.1.1 in the near future. Samsung finished their beta, Motorola already updates phones, and more are coming. Some of the most popular smartphones of 2015 and 2016 are from OnePlus. A company that delivers high-end flagship devices at a wallet friendly price point. The OnePlus 3 is as good as the Galaxy S7 Edge, but for only $399. Not to mention the even better OnePlus 3T for $439, which rivals Google’s own Pixel. Earlier this year OnePlus blend the two teams working on the OS for China and the rest of the world into one group. An effort to bring the latest software and features to all devices at a faster pace. It seems to have worked, because the OnePlus 3 Android 7.0 Nougat update is now available. OnePlus Android 7.0 Nougat Updates While we can expect a slew of devices to see updates, the company is starting with the most important ones first. Those being the 3 and 3T. Then we can look forward to the OnePlus X, and potentially the OP2 from 2015. The company promised updates would arrive before the end of December, and technically they hit that mark. The community beta test is over, and OnePlus leader Carl Pei had this to say on Twitter. Advertisement 2) Android N stable OTA for the OP3 and the OP3T. Gradual rollout will begin later tonight. — Carl Pei (@getpeid) December 31, 2016 On December 31st the OnePlus 3 and 3T received the official “over-the-air” update to Android Nougat. Some got it right away, others saw a slight delay. Expect all updates to conclude by January 14th. Giving OnePlus two weeks to deliver it to all users. On January 9th OnePlus confirmed another Nougat update is rolling out with fixes and tweaks. Alternatively, those who don’t want to wait for the OTA can flash the software themselves. For now only the latest two phones are getting updates. More are coming at a later date. Don’t expect the original to receive Android 7.0 Nougat officially. That said, the developer community at the OnePlus forums or XDA will surely have a version available for download. The OnePlus 2 will get Android 7.0 Nougat Advertisement In closing, the company has confirmed the OnePlus 2 will indeed be updated to Android Nougat. There is no timeframe yet, but we’ll update once we know more. What’s New in Android 7.0 Nougat Our link at the top of the page is an in-depth look at Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow vs Android 7.0 Nougat. Including everything that’s new and different with comparison photos. It goes over many of the key changes, so start there. Including changes in Android 7.1.1 Nougat. As a quick recap, the OnePlus Android 7.0 update will bring improved performance, better battery life with “Doze” features, better split-screen multitasking, the recent apps button works like ALT+TAB and switches between the last used apps, and much more. Google has over 50 big changes in Android N. Like faster app installs, which are also smaller, a new JIT compiler, improved graphics and performance with the Vulkan API, revamped notifications with quick reply from the pulldown bar, customizable quick setting tiles and so much more. Expect all of that to be highlighted on the OnePlus 3 and it’s nearly stock version of Android. Advertisement A huge addition announced at Google IO was “Android Instant Apps” which will enable Android to install small bits of an app (say, from a search result or web link) and allow one-time instant app usage. No installing an app and starting over. Android just adds what it needs for that moment, uses the app then removes those parts, and we’re done. That has yet to go live, but we’re expecting it by the end of the year. Not to mention things like a better and improved Google Now or Search using the Google Assistant with machine learning, number blocking and call screening, and more than we know under the hood or behind the scenes. OP smartphones run nearly stock Android, similar to the Google Pixel. This means it doesn’t have a huge layer of changes like we see from Samsung, LG or HTC. Allowing the developers to finish updates easier and faster. Technically the update is listed as OxygenOS 4.0 when it hits devices, not labeled as Android Nougat. However, here’s what the upgrade entails. Upgraded to Android 7.0 Nougat New Notifications Design New Settings Menu Design Multi-Window View Notification Direct Reply Custom DPI Support Added Status Bar Icon Options Improved Shelf Customization Final Thoughts In previous years we received slow updates from the company, but that certainly isn’t the case to kick-off 2017. In fact, OnePlus is ahead of Samsung, LG, HTC and many others. Rather than waiting until March or later for the newest release, owners can get it the first week of January. Again, those still waiting on Android 7.0 Nougat for their phone, need to know that it will arrive soon. The company is slowly releasing it to all devices. Then, their team will continue working on the OnePlus 2 Android Nougat update. This is good news for owners, as most didn’t expect such timely updates. The fact that users with a Samsung device are waiting, while OnePlus is sending out Nougat, is a big deal. Enjoy the update to Android 7.0 Nougat, and we’ll update once we know more about incremental upgrades to Android 7.1.1 in the near future. Are you still waiting for it to arrive? If it did, are you experiencing issues?

On display here at CES in Las Vegas, SolarGaps turns the actual slats of your window coverings into solar panels. SolarGaps blinds will be smart enough to shift their angle slightly throughout the day in order to maximize their power intake. The company also plans to integrate with the Google Home. Smart home scoreboard at CES The scoreboard Google Home's progress Alexa's progress Siri's progress I'd love to control solar-powered blinds with my voice using Google's always-listening assistant, but note that Google's smart home language -- Weave -- doesn't actually work with blinds yet. SolarGaps could be extra exciting if it's an indication of a whole new smart home product category for Google Home. Or SolarGaps could be a small tech startup trying to make noise at CES by name-dropping Google. I'm hoping for the former. Google Home aside, SolarGaps will have iOS and Android apps. The company also wants to integrate with Nest and SmartThings. If your Nest senses it's too cold, it could send a signal to your blinds to let in more light and heat your place naturally. 57 Check out all the smart home products at CES 2017 (so far) SolarGaps has a control box that responds to gestures, and the app has the functionality you'd expect -- basic controls and scheduling. SolarGaps blinds should cost between $480 to $890 per square meter of window, and they don't look the part of high-priced designer blinds. They look like big, black solar panels. Still, if you prioritize energy and convenience over style, SolarGaps blinds will be worth keeping an eye on, especially if the company can pull off that Google Home integration. SolarGaps will start a crowdfunding campaign in February for a planned release in the middle of the year. (UK and Australian details weren't available, but those prices convert to roughly £390 and £725 or AU$660 and AU£1,220.)

Name: Subject: Message: 10 best backgrounds and wallpaper apps for Android Apps & Gamesby Joe Hindy1 week ago 16 371 24 15 Finding great wallpapers and backgrounds for your Android device isn’t all that difficult. There are a ton of apps out there that can do the task. On top of that, a simple Google image search can also show you some unique options. The trick is finding the apps that work best for you and finding the kind of stuff you want to see. Let’s take a quick look at the best backgrounds and wallpaper apps for Android! Here are the best HD wallpapers and QHD wallpapers for Android! Or check out some of the best live wallpaper apps that you can find! Customize your home screen more with the best Android themes to go with your new wallpaper! Backdrops [Price: Free with in-app purchases] Backdrops is an above average option if you’re looking for good wallpapers. It features a variety of styles along with some modern features. For instance, you’ll be able to sign in with your Google account to sync wallpapers across devices. It’s a good start for collecting some good wallpapers. The only caveat is that there is a pro version that comes with exclusive wallpapers, and then additional paid content on top of that for more wallpaper packs. It’s not inherently bad, but it can be frustrating if you don’t know it’s coming. It’s one of the better wallpaper apps and it’s worth a shot. Get it now on Google Play! Backgrounds HD [Price: Free] Backgrounds HD has been around for a long time and is one of the most popular wallpaper apps on this list. It’s considered good because it has a metric ton of wallpapers to choose from. Updates in 2015 and 2016 have modernized the design and 30 categories helps keep their massive collection in line. There are a variety of resolutions supported so you may have to wade through some lower quality images to find the really high quality stuff. In any case, the app is completely free so it’s worth a chance. Get it now on Google Play! Cool Wallpapers HD [Price: Free] Cool Wallpapers HD is another one of the most popular wallpaper apps available on mobile. It boasts a staggering collection of 200,000 images that you can choose from. These are laid out in a variety of categories for easy surfing. You can also search for specific wallpapers by using tags or even searching by color. Like most, it also supports favorites so you can find your favorite wallpapers again. It’s a decent app that has definitely gotten better over the course of the last year. It’s also completely free. Get it now on Google Play! MTP Ringtones and Wallpapers [Price: Free] MTP Ringtones and Wallpapers is an all-in-one type of app. Along with wallpapers, you can also find ringtones, alarm tones, notification tones, and other stuff. It boasts a collection of HD photos in the thousands. Like other apps in this category, you can save favorites, search through categories, and set the wallpaper from within the app. It’s one of the more simple wallpaper apps out there. That makes it good if you don’t need a lot of bells and whistles. Still, we wish their selection were a little larger. Get it now on Google Play! Muzei Live Wallpaper [Price: Free] Muzei Live Wallpaper is one of the more unique wallpaper apps. Instead of moving around or doing stuff like most live wallpapers, Muzei is a live wallpaper that just automatically updates your wallpaper over the course of an average day. It will cycle through its own collection of wallpapers or you can create your own. This is a great app for those who like to change it up frequently and its collection is pretty fantastic. Most of its images are classic pieces of artwork which you can learn about as they pop up. It’s completely free to download and use if you’re interested. Get it now on Google Play! See also: The best Android apps, ever! 5 days ago Tapet [Price: Free with in-app purchases] Tapet is a (relatively) newer offering that’s quickly gaining popularity. This app doesn’t offer backgrounds like most wallpaper apps. Instead, this one will generate a wallpaper for you. Once you open the app, you’ll be able to choose from a variety of patterns and colors. The app will then create a wallpaper just for you. It also creates wallpapers based on your device’s screen resolution. That means it’ll be crisp which is what you’re looking for. There’s a free trial to check it out before it asks you to pay anything. Get it now on Google Play! True HD 4K Wallpapers [Price: Free] The name of this app is pretty lame, but thankfully it makes up for it by having a good selection of wallpapers. What makes this app special is that it will only show you wallpapers based on your screen resolution. Therefore, those with 1080p displays won’t see 540×960 images. If you’re rocking a 2K screen or greater, you won’t be bothered by lower resolution stuff. One of the more difficult things to do is find good 2K and 4K wallpapers since a lot of wallpaper apps don’t have that many yet. This gets the bric-a-brac out of the way so you can find those crispy wallpapers. It’s one of the best free wallpaper apps out there. Get it now on Google Play! Wallpapers by Google [Price: Free] Wallpapers by Google is probably the most simple of all the wallpaper apps on this list. It shows a smaller selection of wallpapers, but they are all high resolution. You can access additional wallpapers using Google+, Google Earth, and other sources that Google calls “partners”. You also get additional features if your device is running Android 7.0 Nougat or higher. It’s not the most robust option on the list, but it is completely free and taps into some pretty good sources for wallpapers. Get it now on Google Play! Wonderwall [Price: Free with in-app purchases] Wonderwall is one of the lesser-known wallpaper apps on Android. It doesn’t boast massive collections like Backgrounds HD or Cool Wallpapers, but the collection it does boast is hand picked by the developers. They’re mostly things like photography and abstract creations. All of the images are high resolution and should fit well on most screens. Some additional features include the ability to auto-set wallpapers on your device, submit your own photography to be featured in the app, and some other stuff. It’s also free to use with no advertising which is nice. Get it now on Google Play! Zedge [Price: Free] Last on our list is the venerable Zedge. Zedge is probably the most popular app that offers ringtones, notification tones, alarm tones, and wallpapers. It has quite a large selection of all of those and we always manage to find some obscure stuff stashed in there somewhere. Wallpapers can be searched, sorted by category, and Zedge always has some that are picked out as featured when you open the app. The app isn’t perfect and features some of the more outrageous advertising we’ve seen. Their selections do include HD wallpapers and better, but there isn’t really a way to search to get rid of the lower resolution images. It’s a bit like the wild west, but it’s a good app for those looking around. Get it now on Google Play! Bonus: Google Search [Price: Free] Of course, if none of these apps work for you, then you can always turn to the venerable Google Search. There is a whole section for images there and you can search for backgrounds, wallpapers, and even add in variables to find the types that you want. Let’s face it, Google’s image search has more images than pretty much all of these apps combined which makes it a great option. The only issue is that downloading images can be a pain sometimes and you’ll have to set them manually each time. The best reason to use a Google Search is because you can search for resolutions (2K, 4K, 1920×1080, vertical wallpapers, horizontal wallpapers, etc) which helps filter out a lot of the nonsense that you might not want. It’s a good fallback plan if none of these apps have what you’re looking for! Get it now on Google Play! Related best app lists: Check out the best Android launchers!

Skip to content To Inform is to Influence IO, SC, PD, what's in a name? Menu About Information Operations Holistic Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community Calendar Fake News · Information Warfare Did Media Literacy Backfire? January 7, 2017 Joel Harding danah boydFollow researcher of technology & society | Microsoft Research, Data & Society, NYU | zephoria@zephoria.org Anxious about the widespread consumption and spread of propaganda and fake news during this year’s election cycle, many progressives are calling for an increased commitment to media literacy programs. Others are clamoring for solutions that focus on expert fact-checking and labeling. Both of these approaches are likely to fail — not because they are bad ideas, but because they fail to take into consideration the cultural context of information consumption that we’ve created over the last thirty years. The problem on our hands is a lot bigger than most folks appreciate. What Are Your Sources? I remember a casual conversation that I had with a teen girl in the midwest while I was doing research. I knew her school approached sex ed through an abstinence-only education approach, but I don’t remember how the topic of pregnancy came up. What I do remember is her telling me that she and her friends talked a lot about pregnancy and “diseases” she could get through sex. As I probed further, she matter-of-factly explained a variety of “facts” she had heard that were completely inaccurate. You couldn’t get pregnant until you were 16. AIDS spreads through kissing. Etc. I asked her if she’d talked to her doctor about any of this, and she looked me as though I had horns. She explained that she and her friends had done the research themselves, by which she meant that they’d identified websites online that “proved” their beliefs. For years, that casual conversation has stuck with me as one of the reasons that we needed better Internet-based media literacy. As I detailed in my book It’s Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens, too many students I met were being told that Wikipedia was untrustworthy and were, instead, being encouraged to do research. As a result, the message that many had taken home was to turn to Google and use whatever came up first. They heard that Google was trustworthy and Wikipedia was not. Understanding what sources to trust is a basic tenet of media literacy education. When educators encourage students to focus on sourcing quality information, they encourage them to critically ask who is publishing the content. Is the venue a respected outlet? What biases might the author have? The underlying assumption in all of this is that there’s universal agreement that major news outlets like the New York Times, scientific journal publications, and experts with advanced degrees are all highly trustworthy. Think about how this might play out in communities where the “liberal media” is viewed with disdain as an untrustworthy source of information…or in those where science is seen as contradicting the knowledge of religious people…or where degrees are viewed as a weapon of the elite to justify oppression of working people. Needless to say, not everyone agrees on what makes a trusted source. Students are also encouraged to reflect on economic and political incentives that might bias reporting. Follow the money, they are told. Now watch what happens when they are given a list of names of major power players in the East Coast news media whose names are all clearly Jewish. Welcome to an opening for anti-Semitic ideology. Empowered Individuals…with Guns We’ve been telling young people that they are the smartest snowflakes in the world. From the self-esteem movement in the 1980s to the normative logic of contemporary parenting, young people are told that they are lovable and capable and that they should trust their gut to make wise decisions. This sets them up for another great American ideal: personal responsibility. In the United States, we believe that worthy people lift themselves up by their bootstraps. This is our idea of freedom. What it means in practice is that every individual is supposed to understand finance so well that they can effectively manage their own retirement funds. And every individual is expected to understand their health risks well enough to make their own decisions about insurance. To take away the power of individuals to control their own destiny is viewed as anti-American by so much of this country. You are your own master. Children are indoctrinated into this cultural logic early, even as their parents restrict their mobility and limit their access to social situations. But when it comes to information, they are taught that they are the sole proprietors of knowledge. All they have to do is “do the research” for themselves and they will know better than anyone what is real. Combine this with a deep distrust of media sources. If the media is reporting on something, and you don’t trust the media, then it is your responsibility to question their authority, to doubt the information you are being given. If they expend tremendous effort bringing on “experts” to argue that something is false, there must be something there to investigate. Now think about what this means for #Pizzagate. Across this country, major news outlets went to great effort to challenge conspiracy reports that linked John Podesta and Hillary Clinton to a child trafficking ring supposedly run out of a pizza shop in Washington, DC. Most people never heard the conspiracy stories, but their ears perked up when the mainstream press went nuts trying to debunk these stories. For many people who distrust “liberal” media and were already primed not to trust Clinton, the abundant reporting suggested that there was something to investigate. Most people who showed up to the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria to see for their own eyes went undetected. But then a guy with a gun decided he “wanted to do some good” and “rescue the children.” He was the first to admit that “the intel wasn’t 100%,” but what he was doing was something that we’ve taught people to do — question the information they’re receiving and find out the truth for themselves. Experience Over Expertise Many marginalized groups are justifiably angry about the ways in which their stories have been dismissed by mainstream media for decades. This is most acutely felt in communities of color. And this isn’t just about the past. It took five days for major news outlets to cover Ferguson. It took months and a lot of celebrities for journalists to start discussing the Dakota Pipeline. But feeling marginalized from news media isn’t just about people of color. For many Americans who have watched their local newspaper disappear, major urban news reporting appears disconnected from reality. The issues and topics that they feel affect their lives are often ignored. For decades, civil rights leaders have been arguing for the importance of respecting experience over expertise, highlighting the need to hear the voices of people of color who are so often ignored by experts. This message has taken hold more broadly, particularly among lower and middle class whites who feel as though they are ignored by the establishment. Whites also want their experiences to be recognized, and they too have been pushing for the need to understand and respect the experiences of “the common man.” They see “liberal” “urban” “coastal” news outlets as antithetical to their interests because they quote from experts, use cleaned-up pundits to debate issues, and turn everyday people (e.g., “red sweater guy”) into spectacles for mass enjoyment. Consider what’s happening in medicine. Many people used to have a family doctor whom they knew for decades and trusted as individuals even more than as experts. Today, many people see doctors as arrogant and condescending, overly expensive and inattentive to their needs. Doctors lack the time to spend more than a few minutes with patients, and many people doubt that the treatment they’re getting is in their best interest. People feel duped into paying obscene costs for procedures that they don’t understand. Many economists can’t understand why so many people would be against the Affordable Care Act because they don’t recognize that this “socialized” medicine is perceived as experts over experience by people who don’t trust politicians who tell them what’s in their best interest any more than they trust doctors. And public trust in doctors is declining sharply. Why should we be surprised that most people are getting medical information from their personal social network and the Internet? It’s a lot cheaper than seeing a doctor, and both friends and strangers on the Internet are willing to listen, empathize, and compare notes. Why trust experts when you have at your fingertips a crowd of knowledgeable people who may have had the same experience as you and can help you out? Consider this dynamic in light of discussions around autism and vaccinations. First, an expert-produced journal article was published linking autism to vaccinations. This resonated with many parents’ experience. Then, other experts debunked the first report, challenged the motivations of the researcher, and engaged in a mainstream media campaign to “prove” that there was no link. What unfolded felt like a war on experience, and a network of parents coordinated to counter this new batch of experts who were widely seen as ignorant, moneyed, and condescending. The more that the media focused on waving away these networks of parents through scientific language, the more the public felt sympathetic to the arguments being made by anti-vaxxers. Keep in mind that anti-vaxxers aren’t arguing that vaccinations definitively cause autism. They are arguing that we don’t know. They are arguing that experts are forcing children to be vaccinated against their will, which sounds like oppression. What they want is choice — the choice to not vaccinate. And they want information about the risks of vaccination, which they feel are not being given to them. In essence, they are doing what we taught them to do: questioning information sources and raising doubts about the incentives of those who are pushing a single message. Doubt has become tool. Grappling with “Fake News” Since the election, everyone has been obsessed with fake news, as experts blame “stupid” people for not understanding what is “real.” The solutionism around this has been condescending at best. More experts are needed to label fake content. More media literacy is needed to teach people how not to be duped. And if we just push Facebook to curb the spread of fake news, all will be solved. I can’t help but laugh at the irony of folks screaming up and down about fake news and pointing to the story about how the Pope backs Trump. The reason so many progressives know this story is because it was spread wildly among liberal circles who were citing it as appalling and fake. From what I can gather, it seems as though liberals were far more likely to spread this story than conservatives. What more could you want if you ran a fake news site whose goal was to make money by getting people to spread misinformation? Getting doubters to click on clickbait is far more profitable than getting believers because they’re far more likely to spread the content in an effort to dispel the content. Win! CC BY 2.0-licensed photo by Denis Dervisevic. People believe in information that confirms their priors. In fact, if you present them with data that contradicts their beliefs, they will double down on their beliefs rather than integrate the new knowledge into their understanding. This is why first impressions matter. It’s also why asking Facebook to show content that contradicts people’s views will not only increase their hatred of Facebook but increase polarization among the network. And it’s precisely why so many liberals spread “fake news” stories in ways that reinforce their belief that Trump supporters are stupid and backwards. Labeling the Pope story as fake wouldn’t have stopped people from believing that story if they were conditioned to believe it. Let’s not forget that the public may find Facebook valuable, but it doesn’t necessarily trust the company. So their “expertise” doesn’t mean squat to most people. Of course, it would be an interesting experiment to run; I do wonder how many liberals wouldn’t have forwarded it along if it had been clearly identified as fake. Would they have not felt the need to warn everyone in their network that conservatives were insane? Would they have not helped fuel a money-making fake news machine? Maybe. But I think labeling would reinforce polarization — but it would feel like something was done. Nonbelievers would use the label to reinforce their view that the information is fake (and minimize the spread, which is probably a good thing), while believers would simply ignore the label. But does that really get us to where we want to go? Addressing so-called fake news is going to require a lot more than labeling. It’s going to require a cultural change about how we make sense of information, whom we trust, and how we understand our own role in grappling with information. Quick and easy solutions may make the controversy go away, but they won’t address the underlying problems. What Is Truth? As a huge proponent for media literacy for over a decade, I’m struggling with the ways in which I missed the mark. The reality is that my assumptions and beliefs do not align with most Americans. Because of my privilege as a scholar, I get to see how expert knowledge and information is produced and have a deep respect for the strengths and limitations of scientific inquiry. Surrounded by journalists and people working to distribute information, I get to see how incentives shape information production and dissemination and the fault lines of that process. I believe that information intermediaries are important, that honed expertise matters, and that no one can ever be fully informed. As a result, I have long believed that we have to outsource certain matters and to trust others to do right by us as individuals and society as a whole. This is what it means to live in a democracy, but, more importantly, it’s what it means to live in a society. In the United States, we’re moving towards tribalism, and we’re undoing the social fabric of our country through polarization, distrust, and self-segregation. And whether we like it or not, our culture of doubt and critique, experience over expertise, and personal responsibility is pushing us further down this path. Media literacy asks people to raise questions and be wary of information that they’re receiving. People are. Unfortunately, that’s exactly why we’re talking past one another. The path forward is hazy. We need to enable people to hear different perspectives and make sense of a very complicated — and in many ways, overwhelming — information landscape. We cannot fall back on standard educational approaches because the societal context has shifted. We also cannot simply assume that information intermediaries can fix the problem for us, whether they be traditional news media or social media. We need to get creative and build the social infrastructure necessary for people to meaningfully and substantively engage across existing structural lines. This won’t be easy or quick, but if we want to address issues like propaganda, hate speech, fake news, and biased content, we need to focus on the underlying issues at play. No simple band-aid will work. Special thanks to Amanda Lenhart, Claire Fontaine, Mary Madden, and Monica Bulger for their feedback! Points/spheres: In “Did Media Literacy Backfire?” danah boyd argues that the thorny problems of fake news and the spread of conspiracy theories have, in part, origins in efforts to educate people against misinformation. At the heart of the problem are deeper cultural divides that we must learn how to confront.

Crunch Network On bots, language and making technology disappear Posted Jan 7, 2017 by Elizabeth McGuane 0 SHARES Next Story Talking tech with NBA legends Shaquille O’Neal and Charles Barkley Elizabeth McGuane Crunch Network Contributor Elizabeth McGuane is lead content designer at Intercom. How to join the network There’s a new buzzword in computer design circles every year. This year, the buzzword is without question bots. As with anything we build, we give bots names. It’s something most of us don’t even question. They come pre-personified and ready for us to start that human-computer relationship, just like HAL 9000 or Her: there’s Siri in our iPhones, Alexa in Amazon’s Echo and there’s even Facebook Messenger’s PSL (Pumpkin Spice Latte) Bot. A name can be a way of expressing trust in an object — or expressing control over it. In design terms, a name is a kind of affordance — a handle we can hold onto. As the resident language expert on our product design team, naming things is part of my job. When we began iterating on a bot within our messaging product, I was prepared to brainstorm hundreds of names. Gendered, non-gendered, functional, etc. But first, we did some testing with actual end users to understand their relationship with bots, language and names. We learned that giving a bot an identity isn’t always for the best. Calling a bot Siri does not necessarily have the same relationship-building effect as calling your car Bessie or Old Faithful. Talking and typing are two different things In a voice-activated bot, names are pretty functional: saying “Siri,” “Alexa” or “OK Google” is the conversational equivalent of opening Google and entering a search term.  When you see a search bar, your brain leaps from idea — there’s something I want to find — to action. We do this so often — more than 40,000 times a second — that we don’t think of it as conversing with the system, though we are asking a question and expecting a response. But names don’t trigger an action in text-based bots, or chatbots. Even Slackbot, the tool built into the popular work messaging platform Slack, doesn’t need you to type “Hey Slackbot” in order to retrieve a pre-programmed response. Speaking our searches out loud serves a function, but it also draws our attention to the interaction. This can have both good and bad effects. Voice is fundamentally more “humanizing” than text. A study released in August showed that when we hear something versus when we read the same thing, we are more likely to attribute the spoken word to a human “creator.” The real measure of success for today’s designers is making technology disappear. But what is humanizing can also be irritating. We may find it far more exhausting, as humans, to say “OK Google” 75 times a day than to silently open a laptop and search. From a design perspective, bots are aligned with the whole concept of messaging-as-a-platform — we could build a bot right into our own messenger using the same simple elements we’d already designed for human-to-human conversation. So when we experimented with building a bot, we wanted to use those simple elements to communicate. We gave our test bot a name and let it introduce itself like a real person would: “Hi, I’m Bot, Intercom’s digital assistant.” What we found was surprising. People hated this bot — found it off-putting and annoying. It was interrupting them, getting in the way of what they wanted (to talk to a real person), even though its interactions were very lightweight. We tried different things: alternate voices, so that the bot was sometimes friendly and sometimes reserved and functional. But we didn’t see much change. It was only when we removed the name and took away the first person pronoun and the introduction that things started to improve. The name, more than any other factor, caused friction. Who holds the handle? We’ve been telling ourselves scary stories about robots for more than a century, stories in which we simultaneously pity and mistrust them. When we name the tools we use, we assert control over them; we do that because we want to be the ones having the interaction, doing the job. The digital tools we make live in a completely different psychological landscape to the real world. We can’t get a handle on them, literally. There is no straight line from a tradesman’s hammer he can repair himself to a chatbot designed and built by a design team somewhere in California (or in Dublin, in our case). Unlike most writers in my company, my work does its job best when it’s barely noticed. Control is incredibly important in designing digital tools — most language we see and experience in a product is about affording control and understanding to you, the person using the product — not me, the writer. To be understood intuitively is the goal — the words on the screen are the handle of the hammer. Names and identity lift the tools on the screen to a level above intuition. They make us see the tool in all its virtual glory, and place it in an entirely different context to the person using it — and not always a relationship that person asks for or appreciates. Related Articles Emotibot wants to help chatbots know how you really feel People feel weird about touching robot butts, researchers find Google could be selling Boston Dynamics because even Google thinks these robots are terrifying This might be because of novelty — we might become more comfortable with the virtual, more trusting of it (though this year’s headlines haven’t given us much to trust). But despite the hundreds of movies we’ve made and books we’ve written about robots, introducing personality into technology might not be the way we become more comfortable. There’s another school of thought in design, one that describes it as almost invisible. Siri and Alexa might have been thought of as examples of this type: you can’t really “see” them, and so they disappear into the background. But that’s not necessarily true. As humans, we’re visual people — we respond to what we see. But even more than that, we’re social — we respond to the things we can speak to. It’s why we name our possessions, and why we fear the pretend humans we’ve been imagining for so long. The real measure of success for today’s designers is making technology disappear so that it becomes a true tool for humans. The true measure of success for a designer who deals in words is making tools quieter to use, so we can use them more intuitively.

Smith Jan 6, 2017, 10:12 PM Hands-On LeEco's Bike Has 4G, GPS, Bluetooth and (Yes) Lasers by Mike Prospero Jan 6, 2017, 10:06 PM Our Favorite Products From CES 2017 Picture 1 of 25 Hey, Alexa, what are the most innovative new gadgets of 2017? Amazon’s AI assistant was everywhere at this year’s CES, from phones and cars to robots and refrigerators. But that wasn’t the only big theme at the world’s biggest tech trade show. The team at Tom’s Guide met with more than 200 companies to arrive at this list of the best and most exciting new products. Our picks include a TV that’s so thin you can almost floss with it, a breakthrough that charges your phone across the room, an AI-powered concept car and a 4K streaming box that puts Apple TV to shame. And it has Google Assistant inside. Take that, Alexa. Best of Show: LG Signature OLED TV W Picture 2 of 25 There’s a reason LG nicknamed this TV “wallpaper.” At just about a tenth of an inch thick, the gorgeous W7 OLED set blends so seamlessly into its surroundings, you wonder how it works at all. Available in 65- and 77-inches, we were also blown away by the W7’s stunning picture quality, as well as the audio from its equally impressive Dolby Atmos soundbar, whose upfiring speakers raise and lower with the push of a button on the remote. Because why not! MORE: LG W7 Hands-on Best Virtual Reality: Project Alloy Picture 3 of 25 Intel’s Project Alloy is a VR experience unlike any other. The standalone headset uses four RealSense cameras to scan a room and implement its furniture and walls into the game you’re playing. It also includes an entire computer in the headset, including CPU and battery, which lets you play without being tethered to a computer. The result is an interactive experience that had us ducking behind a table as we waged war with robot enemies. We can’t wait to see what happens when Intel’s partners include the technology in headsets that should appear later this year. MORE: Project Alloy Hands-On Best Innovation: Ossia Cota Tile Picture 4 of 25 Forget about all the so-called "wireless charging" technologies you've seen before. A game-changing breakthrough, Ossia's Cota Tile lives in the ceiling and sends electricity through the air to your device just like a router sends out a Wi-Fi signal. Your phone can charge all day while it sits in your pocket and your smart home devices can get juiced constantly, even if they're nowhere near an outlet. MORE: Ossia Cota Tile Hands-on Editor's Choice: Lego Boost Picture 5 of 25 To succeed in the 21st century job market, today's kids need to learn how to code when they're young. The Lego Boost kit teaches basic programming concepts to children as young as seven as they build any of five really cute robots and control them with a tablet app. Since this is Lego, you can customize these robots with standard bricks too. MORE: Lego Boost Hands-on Best Car Tech: Toyota Concept-i Picture 6 of 25 It will greet you with a wink when you walk up to it, play calming tunes to soothe your mind in difficult times, and it will even let you drive when you want. Toyota's Concept-i isn't just a self-driving car, it's a friend on wheels. Oh, and it looks amazing, too. With the way the Concept-i implements AI, Toyota has elevated what a car can be, and if this is a vision of the kind of tech that's coming down the road, it can't get here soon enough. MORE: Toyota Concept-i Hands-on Best Robot: Ubtech Lynx Picture 7 of 25 The Lynx from Ubtech is a robot like no other. That’s because it’s the first humanoid with Alexa inside. Ask Lynx a question or give it a command, and it will turn it’s head towards you. Don’t be creeped out, because this is a robot with a heart. And a lot of dexterity. The Lynx can execute crazy Yoga poses, dance and even hug your child while you’re on a video call with him from half-way around the world. MORE: Ubtech Lynx Hands-on Best Phone: Asus ZenFone AR Picture 8 of 25 The Asus ZenFone AR is a phone that stands out. It’s the first Android handset to run both the Google Tango augmented reality platform and Daydream VR, and it doesn’t skimp on specs, either. The ZenFone AR is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 CPU, 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Adreno 530 GPU. It also packs a 5.7-inch 2560 x 1440 AMOLED display that will look great when using apps or the Google Daydream VR headset. MORE: Asus ZenFone AR Hands-On Best Budget Phone: Honor 6X Picture 9 of 25 The Honor 6X is the kind of phone that makes you wonder why you pay several hundred bucks for a flagship device. This $249 device packs a dual-lens rear camera (for achieving the iPhone 7 Plus’ portrait mode effect on the cheap) and a fingerprint sensor while boasting all-day battery life. Actually, make that two days, at least when you’re not using it heavily. The 6X is proof that you don’t need to bust your budget just to enjoy some of the finer features smartphones have to offer. MORE: Honor 6X Hands-on Best Smart Home Product: LG Instaview Refrigerator Picture 10 of 25 This Alexa-enabled fridge has a 29-inch touchscreen that runs not just Windows 10, but webOS, too. Among other things, you can check the weather, play music, and leave notes for your family. Cameras inside the LG Instaview refrigerator send photos to your smartphone to let you see if you’re running low on eggs, or you can simply tap the display, and it will turn clear. This lets you look inside without ever having to open the door. MORE: LG Instaview Hands-on Best Design: Dell Canvas 27 Picture 11 of 25 It has a screen that folds down, a pen, and a dial that you can use to select tools and change colors on the fly. No, it’s not the Surface Studio. Dell’s Canvas 27 gives creative professionals a fantastically versatile workspace for a fraction of the price. This display plugs into any existing Windows 10 PC and offers a new interface (in partnership with Stardock) that will make you feel Minority Report-powerful. MORE: Dell Canvas 27 Hands-on Best Laptop: Acer Predator 21X Picture 12 of 25 The Predator 21X is what happens when you throw caution (and budgets) to the wind. This head-turning beast of a gaming laptop sports a curved 21-inch display, which is a first for any laptop. There’s also a mechanical keyboard on board, dual Nvidia 1080 graphics cards and a very nifty magnetic touchpad that you can flip over that turns into a number pad. Sure, this brute costs $9,000, but if you have the means, why the hell not? MORE: Acer Predator 21x Hands-on Best PC: Dell XPS 27 Picture 13 of 25 Plenty of all-in-one PCs look stunning, but the Dell XPS 27 is one of the few that sounds great as well. That's because this desktop packs a whopping 10-speaker soundbar right below its display, allowing you to hear your music, movies and shows the way they were meant to sound. Factor in a 27-inch 4K touch display that can be laid flat, and you've got a spectacular all-in-one for artists, musicians or simply anyone who wants their content to both look and sound fantastic. MORE: Dell XPS 27 Hands-On Best TV: Sony Bravia XBR-A1E Picture 14 of 25 Sony insists on both great picture and great sound for its TVs, but that’s hard to accomplish when sets are becoming thinner and thinner. With the Bravia XBR-A1E, Sony devised a novel solution: turn the screen itself into a speaker. The Bravia XBR-A1E boasts a gorgeous 4K HDR OLED screen, but what really sets it apart is that the screen itself vibrates to produce sound. Not only are there no speakers required, but its novel Acoustic Surface technology should sound even better than most tiny flat screen TV speakers. MORE: Sony Bravia XBR-AIE Hands-on Best Streaming Box: Nvidia Shield Picture 15 of 25 The first Nvidia Shield was a respectable streaming box/game console hybrid; the new Nvidia Shield has the potential to be the centerpiece of your house. With an integrated games store that draws from three robust sources, full support for 4K and HDR games streamed through Steam and built-in Google Assistant with smart home commands, the Nvidia Shield could be one of the most powerful and versatile streaming players to ever hit the market. It’s also the only Android TV system with access to Amazon Video. MORE: Nvidia Shield Hands-on Best Monitor: Dell UltraSharp 32 8K Monitor Picture 16 of 25 Dell's 32-inch UltraSharp 8K monitor is the kind of product that you truly need to see to believe. This droolworthy screen can display over one billion colors and close to 33 billion pixels, which makes photos look incredibly true to life while allowing you to see every fine detail of a map or schematic. The UP3218K's $5,000 price tag means that it's not for everyone, but it's stunning sharpness makes it the ultimate display for creative professionals. MORE: Dell UP3218K Hands-On Best Gaming PC: CyberPower Luxe Picture 17 of 25 CyberPower manages to out-crazy itself every CES, making its new Luxe PC an easy pick for our favorite gaming desktop of the show. The CyberPower Luxe looks like it rolled out of a monster truck show in the best way possible, with a stunning, cage-like chassis that you can easily lift open to access the rainbow of backlit components waiting inside. With support for multiple graphics cards, the highest-end processors and a variety of custom cooling options, the Luxe is just as much a geeky work of art as it is a beastly gaming desktop. MORE: CyberPower Luxe Hands-On Best Security: Bitdefender Box Picture 18 of 25 Most smart home tech doesn’t have very good security. You have three choices: don’t use it, leave yourself open to cybercrime or invest in hardware to protect yourself. The new Bitdefender Box is a router add-on (although you can also use it as a standalone router) that monitors not only the security of your PC and mobile devices, but your IoT gadgets as well. Users can block unauthorized devices attempting to the network, or prevent existing devices from accessing malicious sites. Over time, the Bitdefender Box will learn new smart home vulnerabilities, and defend against them, too. MORE: Bitdefender Box Hands-On Best Health Tech: LeEco Smart Bike Picture 19 of 25 The ultimate bike for the quantified cyclist, LeEco’s Smart Bike (available in both mountain and road configurations) features GPS, 4G connectivity, a heart rate monitor, and a mess of other sensors so you can make the most of your rides. A 4-inch touchscreen lets you map your routes, and a hydraulic lock ensures that no one makes off with your ride. The bike even boasts lasers, which beam onto the road to show motorists where you’re riding. MORE: LeEco Smart Bike Hands-on Best Router: Norton Core Picture 20 of 25 The Internet can be a scary place. The Norton Core router promises to remove some of those worries with parental control features that keep your kids away from online harm along with security measures that will do likewise for your connected devices. Just as important, Core makes those features easy to manage, if you never wanted “network administrator” to be one of your household chore. All of this is housed in an eye-catching geodisic design that will fit right in to almost any home. MORE: Norton Core Hands-on Best Gaming Concept: Razer Project Ariana Picture 21 of 25 What do you get when you cross some smart light bulbs, a video projector and Razer's Chroma technology? It's Razer's latest concept, dubbed Project Ariana, which takes your favorite video game and projects it onto your world creating a colorful, semi-immersive experience from the comfort of your living room. Trust us, Project Ariana has to be seen to be believed.  MORE: Razer Project Ariana Hands-on Best Gaming Hardware: Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ Picture 22 of 25 There are lots of gaming monitors with 4K resolution and Nvidia G-Sync, but for some reason, not many systems have embraced the vibrant color technology of high dynamic range (HDR). The Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ combines all three features, along with a blindingly fast 144-Hz refresh rate, to give gamers the best-looking experience possible. At 27 inches, the PG27UQ is small enough to fit into a desktop gaming setup, and its striking, angular design means it’ll turn heads even when powered off. MORE: Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ Hands-on Best Audio: Sennheiser Ambeo Smart Surround Earphones Picture 23 of 25 Most earphones let you listen to music, answer calls and summon your digital assistant. But, the Ambeo Smart Surrounds aren't most earphones. Sennheiser's stylish in-ear cans can record 3D audio for a more immersive listening experience, which goes hand-in-hand with the growing popularity of augmented, merged and virtual reality. Best of all, all you need to start recording are the earphones and a compatible iPhone. MORE: Sennheiser Ambeo Smart Surround Earphones Ears-on Best Cord Cutting: Mohu Airwave Picture 24 of 25 An HD antenna is a great way to save money, but it does mean that your local channels are all tethered to one TV, and a long, unsightly cord will have to snake its way from the window to your television. The Mohu Airwave eliminates that hassle by acting as a totally wireless system. Simply put the Airwave near a window, connect it to a Wi-Fi network and access dozens of local channels with a streaming app for Roku, Apple TV or similar players. Now, every TV in the house can access broadcast networks.

Legere’s first prediction for 2017 is that cable companies will try to enter wireless through MVNO deals, but that they’ll fail. Legere adds that because of this, T-Mobile will not get into any MVNO deals with cable companies. Cable companies are the only ones that’ll try to get into wireless in 2017, Legere suggests, as he thinks that “a MAJOR new player will jump in and shake up US wireless in a MAJOR way.” The T-Mo CEO specifically guesses that Google will “go for the mobile moonshot.” Google offers wireless service through Project Fi, which runs on the T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular networks, but Legere appears to think that Google will take things a step farther in 2017. Sticking with the topic of other companies, Legere thinks that Dish will be no more this year after it missed its opportunity to enter wireless using its supply of spectrum. Moving on to television shows, Legere predicts that the majority of TV watching will happen on mobile by the end of 2017. More than one-third of TV viewing happens on something other than a TV, Legere says, with that number jumping to 50 percent for people under 25. And T-Mo’s CEO expects those numbers to continue to grow. The second TV-related prediction from Legere is that content built for OTT and mobile consumption, like his Slow Cooker Sunday show, will pass cable channels in number of viewers. Specifically, Legere thinks that his Slow Cooker Sunday show will get a weekly audience of 1 million viewers by the end of 2017. The show currently pulls in more than 500,000 viewers each week. Rounding out John’s 2017 predictions are gigabit LTE speeds, which T-Mobile touts that it’s nearly achieved in lab testing; a wireless CEO shuffle that’ll see three of the four current CEOs exiting their positions this year; and merger discussions between Verizon and Comcast as a way to help Comcast get into wireless. While John didn’t make any specific predictions about T-Mobile’s network, it seems likely that T-Mo will continue to build out its LTE coverage in 2017. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray said yesterday that T-Mo plans to cover 320 million POPs with LTE in 2017, up from the 313 million covered at the end of 2016. Ray also said that T-Mobile currently reaches 251 million people with its Extended Range LTE coverage and that that number will grow in the first half of 2017. So what do you think of all these predictions? Do you have any that you’d like to add?

The prospect of that being the year end coverage map is so very exciting! Mark Kendrick I’m amazed myself by the improvement in their network in just the last year. I tried TMO last year for a couple of months but bailed because the service wasn’t very good, a year later and I’m quite satisfied Edward Ward Over the past year I have seen my coverage improve tremendously, to the point where I now have coverage on par with my wife who is Verizon loyal. Jason Caprio Those are some nice coverage predictions. I’ll believe it when I see it. I hope to see the day when T-Mobile ties/beats Verizon in rootmetrics, then I’ll switch back! I’m rooting for T-Mobile all the way! Cellphone Chris The cable MVNO thing isn’t a prediction, it’s already been announced. Those that know what I’m talking about understand that a merger between Verizon and Comcast seems highly unlikely. a d00d With Republicans in control of all 3 houses (Capitol Hill House, Senate, and White House), this merger is very much a possibility. In fact, depending on how fast they change things, I could even call it certain. Evil attracts Evil, after all. And I wonder how many board members are shared? Of course, we’ll all suffer for it, along with a TMo merger, but that’s the way it goes. At least we should be rid of Obamacare… Acdc1a We have no idea what is to come. A Republican wasn’t elected President, a populist was. If popular opinion is against the idea, it doesn’t go through. If it’s well sold to the public, it will. Linx I can’t see myself on any other carrier than T-Mobile right now. Richard Roma That’s interesting, I’m on the opposite end where I feel like evaluating other options. I don’t like this One only push at all. Jay Holm This coming April I will have been with T-Mobile for 4 full years. Very happy customer. Walt Get ride of the 3G hspa and use that spectrum for LTE. Keep 2G edge for all the flip phones and m2m Andrew Singleton keeping any 2g is a horrible idea. tmo’s new flip phone is LTE. a d00d Andrew, you need to re-read about IoT in the article earlier in the week. Walt, the problem is that many of the IoT resellers have been nudging these guys onto 3G as a cheaper measure than going directly to LTE as most companies only think of the short haul (bottom line for this quarter or year only) versus the long haul (let someone else pay for it). Plus there are a huge number of 3G handsets still in use, especially from other, poorer countries or rural carriers in this one who refuse to upgrade, likely because they can’t afford it. 2G will be with us a few more years, and 3G probably until the mid 2020’s at the earliest. Then again, with some of the fancy on-the-fly spectrum shuffling these new software-defined radio systems can do, it has been pointed out by others that, at least in an advanced network like TMo’s, they may NEVER go away completely! Nobody Special I predict after January 22nd @ The deadline for simple choice subscribers to switch to t-mobile one and get the tax included deal …. t-mobile will come up with a new incentive to trick the remaining simple choice subscribers to come to the darkside “T-Mobile One”…. the saga continues. nearvanaman I sort of rolled my eyes at T-Mo One because I typically use 1.5 to 3.0 gigs a month. But my 6GB plan, with taxes, costs me $75 a month. This “new” T-Mo One incentive will cost me a maximum of $70 and, sometimes, $60. I know the point is to get people on to the One plan and it’s hard to see a downside of doing this if they are never going to offer tiered plans again. Acdc1a For you it’s a no-brainer. I have 5 lines on ONE and Leger is right, it’s nice not to try to count GB. AJ2 What Tmo has failed to realize with the Tmo One plans is that most people still use 2gb or less. The $10 ‘back’ is a nice marekting ploy that I guess will make the plan a $60. If you use a Nexus or Pixel, Project Fi would still be cheaper. I see all these ads for $40 a line but thats only if you buy 4 lines. If they’d offer something for single customers, Id give Tmobile a try again as its the only one of the big 4 Ive ever had before switching to MVNOs. I dont care about a free Subway sandwich or some coupon to a product Idont want. If you can give a family of 4 free lines, you surely can do a promotion to offer single people a break Jay Holm If all people use is 2GB’s or less, what is the point in have a $500-$700+ smartphone? That’s like having a $20k car and driving lessons than 20 miles total per day, if I go no where but to work and back home that would be nearly 26 miles total in one day. I just don’t understand what the purpose is having a $500-$700 device and only use a measly 2gigs in a 30 day period. John Doe I don’t think Dish will end in 2017. They have Sling TV and Charlie Ergen isn’t a stupid guy so maybe I doubt it will disappear in 2017 that is too soon. I think John hopes that Dish will disappear so he can get his hands on their spectrum LoL (Oh that is right they have spectrum they can sell if things get bad for Dish) a d00d I don’t know if it was a mis-quote or not as I didn’t watch the video or whatever, but I think he meant Dish as a potential wireless competitor. The FCC has repeatedly warned them that they have never complied with their rules regarding build-out time after purchasing spectrum. That is, Dish is a Spectrum Squatter, the wireless version of a Domain Squatter, and, even under a new right-wing admin, I think the FCC may have finally had enough. Consider they let Globalstar use their little block of spectrum for limited terrestrial use after they’ve been begging for years. OTOH, Ergen has been squatting on a boat-load of spectrum with no network for years despite FCC pressure to sell or build. I for one truly hope that the FCC finally drops the hammer. QWR At CES, Legere actually said something to the effect that delivery of satellite-based content is dead, and so Dish will be dead as well. IMO he was not talking about Dish as a wireless provider. As far as the FCC goes, they have very little interest in going after Ergen for squatting since they turned him down for buying anyone on the cheap in 2015. He attempted to put it to use, and has until sometime this year to sell or lease 50% of his spectrum, even though it’s transmission properties are more suited for large amounts of data vs. speed. BadBatz 1. How about “predicting” some bonuses, freebies, incentives, etc. for long time subscribers to T-Mobile… The siren song of AT&T is calling… And Project Fi is taking already a lot of my business away from T-Mob… 2. Bandwidth… Need more bandwidth… How about more bandwidth… No more bandwidth, no more wireless watching of anything, Mr. Legere. And rural coverage… 3. Please, Mr. Legere, “predict” better international coverage for “free data roaming” and 20 cent voice calls. Some initiatives notwithstanding (Europe higher speed data for example) international roaming has become a sad joke: data throttled to the point of being unusable (64 kbps in may places), inability to dial out to many countries whilst roaming, etc. Even the T-Mobile app no workee in may places… Please “predict” improvements or just “predict” going back to the sate of int’l roaming from 2015… marque2 Project To always seemed really expensive to me. $10 per gig, wow. AJ2 Id switch to Tmobile if it had a less expensive plan for single customers, especially people that dont use 10-20 gb of data. Left Tmo years ago – First went to Straight Talk for their $45 5gb LTE plan and now on Fi where my bills are tiny. If Im not mistaken, with their new $10 rebate, the lowest plan is $60 if you use less than 2gb. Even getting paid $150 to switch doesnt make it worth it. Expert go with tmobile prepaid BadBatz If you don’t use gobs of data stay with Fi. For email, news, maps/navigation, etc. my total monthly bill is seldom over $30. Fi prefers T-Mobile anyway, even whilst roaming abroad the US endpoint is a T-Mobile IP in Texas, but connects to other networks stateside if T-Mobile is not available. Besides, laptop tethering doesn’t cost extra, roaming data is at full speed and it roams in some countries where T-Mobile does not. And Fi forwards calls AND text messages – the latter priceless if you use multiple phones. I have no idea what will become of Project Fi but for now I’m happy to have “Google talk” in my pocket :-) marque2 T-Mobile offered full speed tethering with its older plans. And I believe low speed tethering is included in Europe. Europe is way behind going to LTE, so high speed is also.lst impossible anyway. Jay Holm Since you use “so little data”, why even have a smartphone? Seriously! What a waste of money for someone who doesn’t even use their smartphone! marque2 Agreed, he can get a flip phone and 350 minutes of monthly service for $9 a month. Aleks I always knew that Google would enter the fray with a wireless service of their own. For John Legere to make this prediction, tells me that Google and T-Mobile could be looking at a merger, which to me, is the whole purpose of Google entering the wireless business sector. It’s been discussed behind closed doors. If this indeed does happen, look for wireless to be much cheaper and faster as Google is known to keep things affordable for the masses. Don’t take my word for it but if you’re on a legacy T-Mobile plan right now and ggrandfathered in, consider yourself lucky as they will be a major player in the wireless industry for the foreseeable future. I’m looking at Google and T-Mobile to work together and pave the way for the future. But like I said, don’t take my word for it. Just see it happening from a business standpoint. marque2 Google is evil. It will be a sad day when they take over TM. Nearmsp I would like to know what percentage of interstate freeways and state highways are covered rather than the million population. We just do not talk when we are in population centers. We talk while get from point A to point B and we could travel through places with no population on the way out of one city to another. This is the reason why people go for AT&T and Verizon. Coverage outside of major cities should be a goal of T-mobile. Currently I carry a a Verizon myfi and switch on as soon as leave the metro area to be able to do wi-fi calling. T-mobile coverage outside cities still sucks. It has improved much but a long way to go. KeepU You don’t happen to do much of that rural driving in West Virginia or between I-35 and I-5 do you? I drive a truck, and those are the only places I find a big difference in coverage between my t-mobile and verizon coverage. marque2 He doesn’t do much rural driving in his apparent state of Texas. Or never uses the phone while driving. Jay Holm I’ve driven from Houston to Laredo, from Houston to Dallas, from Houston to Longview. . .never lost signal in between any of these places. marque2 Try Midland to El Paso. No coverage for 200 miles when I last drove it. Try driving I-40 in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. I have a fairly new 5x as well. Parts of I15 in CA. Shouldn’t have problems with the new bands. And once the interstates are covered major highways should be next 395 and 78 “Ortega highway” comes to mind. I know TM is small and is trying hard to cover more, bit to claim no issues while travelling is false. Also note San Diego has major holes in Oceanside, Carlsbad, parts of Coronado and San Diego bay. They haven’t put Band 12 in San Diego yet. KeepU I predict the low grade billing fraud will continue, as will the network build out, and despite it’s serious flaws T-mobile will continue to be the least bad of the major wireless providers. QWR Nice hat. Did you get a free bowl of soup with it? And Dish would like to officially declare that you cut your hair this year. Steven Prediction, T-Mobile will continue to ignore the Alabama and Florida Gulf Coast by not issuing the much needed Extended Range LTE.

Well not all the time, but some of us set goals for the New Year and just forget them. For example lose weight or exercise more often. So, Google is here to help you with that if you are using the Goals feature from the Google Calendar. Google announced on Thursday that you can connect Google Fit and Apple Health to your fitness goals in Calendar. “When you do, activity in your favorite fitness apps will be recorded and used to mark your goals in Google Calendar as ‘done’ automatically,” reads a blog post. Now, before this new feature you had to mark your goal as completed in Google Calendar. The company brought Goals last year with the promise to help you manage your busy schedule in order to achieve goals like working out, reading more books or learning a new language. Google believes that postponing a task or a goal is very easy to happen to all of us. But, Google Goals will help you find the time and stick to it. And according to them it is very easy to set a goal. You just have to answer a few questions (such as “How often?” and “Best time?”), and you are ready to start! From there Calendar will look at your schedule and find the best windows to add your personal goals.   Source: https://blog.google/products/calendar/track-your-new-years-fitness-goals-with-google-calendar/ Another feature you will get with Goals is rescheduling. For example, Calendar will automatically reschedule if you add another event that’s a direct conflict with a goal. You can also defer a goal at any time, and Calendar will make time for it later. Finally, Google Calendar can actually gets better and at scheduling the more you use it. You just need to defer, edit or complete your goals like normal, and Calendar will choose even better times in the future. Google seems to be very proud about Calendar and they chose the best way to celebrate its 10th anniversary. And they are more than willing to make more updates like Goals, and help us find more time for ourselves and our family – from your daily must-dos, to exercising more, to just a little “me time.” Download Google Calendar at the Play Store or App Store Share the joy                 Share this: Reddit Email Facebook Skype Twitter Tumblr Google LinkedIn More Pinterest Author: Martha Papadimitriou Martha is a journalist, a blog writer, a mother and a bookworm.

In the Google realm, that means we’ve seen plenty of new Android phones, Chromebooks, wearables, and more. But CES is always a matter of finding the diamonds in the rough. There are always some impressive announcements, but the vast majority of things we’ve seen this week have been either mundane or old news. That’s why we’ve done the work for you. Follow after the break to get a peek at our picks for the best Android, Chrome and Google-related products that debuted at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show… Best Android Wear watch: New Balance RunIQ Our first award is for the best Android Wear watch of the show, and we were actually surprised to find that there were a couple new watches announced this week. The new Casio watch (which is definitely the runner-up in this category) builds on what that company launched last year, but our pick for the best Android Wear device of the show goes to the new New Balance RunIQ. It’s the first Android Wear watch made specifically for running, and it’s only the third or fourth Android Wear watch made for fitness (succeeding the Moto 360 Sport, the Sony SmartWatch 3, and the more recent Polar M600). As we mentioned in our hands-on, there’s nothing too special about the watch, but it does run Android Wear 2.0 and does just about everything that a fitness smartwatch should — it tracks heart rate, steps, speed, calories, distance, and more. It was definitely a close fight with Casio for this watch, but we were won over by the New Balance’s availability timeline (it’s going to hit store shelves early next month), value (it’s more affordable at $300), its running-specific features (never seen that in an Android Wear watch before!) and its generally refined take on what a fitness smartwatch powered by Android Wear should be. The demo at the Intel booth showing just how accurately the watch tracked fitness stats was also impressive. Best Android smartphone: ZenFone AR CES is always home to the launch of many an Android phone, and this year we saw a few notable launches. ZTE and LG hit the show floor with some budget options, Huawei launched the Mate 9 in the United States with Amazon Alexa, and Xiaomi showed off the white version of the Mi Mix made for outside the US. The one standout of the show for us, however, was the ASUS ZenFone AR. And ASUS’ other new phone, the ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom, was also a top contender. ASUS has made the Zenfone AR the first Android smartphone to hit the United States with an option for 8GB of RAM, and the phone packs the powerful Snapdragon 821, which isn’t the latest Qualcomm chip but definitely a great one. But for us at 9to5Google, the ZenFone AR stands out for one reason: it’s made to work with Google’s Tango AR platform. That platform is definitely still growing for now, as we’ve noted, but it has a lot of potential. We saw the Lenovo PHAB2 Pro in the summer and fall of last year, but that device was just too big — and frankly its software too horrendous — for us to wholeheartedly recommend it as a consumer product. This phone is different. It does Tango, it has a much more reasonable physical size, and its software is definitely closer to being a polished user experience. Oh, and it supports Daydream. Really, the only downside for us at this year’s CES is that we weren’t actually able to see the Tango features in action quite yet. Be did, however, get some really nice photos and video — so check that out. Best Chromebook: Samsung Chromebook Pro/Plus Chromebooks have felt like they’ve been on the backburner for the last year, but thankfully CES 2017 brought a few new Chromebooks for us to get our grubby (literally, CES isn’t the cleanest place in the world) hands on. Of those, we saw the ASUS Chromebook Flip 2 (an honorable mention!), but the star of the show was a pair of new Chromebooks from Samsung. Somewhat confusingly called the Chromebook Pro and the Chromebook Plus, the two laptops are identical apart from their processors. We picked these Chromebooks because they are the Chromebooks we’ve always wanted. As we said, they breathe new life into Chrome OS. All products have compromises, but these two sleek laptops from Samsung have the least compromises of any Chromebook ever. They have a solid build, the Pro has a very powerful processor (for a Chromebook), they touch screens that flip around to be used like a tablet, they sport USB-C ports (welcome to 2017!), they rock Android apps without a hitch, and they even have styluses. Really, the only compromise is probably going to be their price tags (the Plus is starting at $449, and the higher-end Pro is TBD), but I think we can forgive that for the purpose of this award — prices will surely fall over the coming year. Best Android TV: Nvidia Shield TV and Spot Android TV is another platform that was been largely ignored in 2016, so it’s good to see it get a little attention at CES this year. The OEM that gave it that attention was Nvidia, a company that is becoming known for more and more products that aren’t desktop graphics cards. And the product that this company launched this year is the latest Nvidia Shield TV, a little (seriously, it’s unexpectedly tiny) Android TV set-top box that can do a lot more than just play little games from the Play Store and Netflix. Here at 9to5Google we’re big fans of Google Assistant, so the Nvidia Shield TV being the first Android TV device to get Google’s new helper was a big reason we went with this device. For just $199 (pre-orders now open on Amazon!), the Shield supports streaming 4K HDR content from a variety of services like Amazon and Netflix, and there are even hundreds of console-quality games waiting for you on Shield store. Another big reason we went with this device, however, is the new $49 Shield Spot that launched alongside the Shield. It extends Google Assistant throughout your home with a tiny little device that you can just pop into an outlet.

One of these is the ability to input text when talking directly to the Assistant on the Google Pixel. Other changes include further work to get Assistant working on Android Wear plus something new called “Search gestures”… The biggest find is, of course, the ability to talk to the Google Assistant through written text. This would look and feel very similar to how you can communicate with the Assistant through Allo. Added to the application was a keyboard icon. Once this feature is launched, users might be able to tap it and the Assistant’s UI will change to include a text field for written input. While most people are fine having vocal conversations with their phones for now, this update would pave the way for the day that bots get fully integrated into the Google Assistant. Instead of having to direct orders only through voice, you’ll be able to communicate with all of those future services by simply typing a couple of instructions. In previous teardowns of the Android Wear application, code snippets were found that hinted to the fact that Google was working to bring the Assistant to Wear 2.0. New code in the Google app appears to now be corroborating this fact. For now, not much can be found other than some code that points to new settings for the Android Wear Assistant. Lastly, something called “Search gestures” has been found in the latest beta build. While nothing is confirmed at this point, the name does make it sound like you’ll be able to activate the Google search interface by swiping down on the home screen instead of reaching up and tapping on the search bar at the top of the screen. This could be useful on tablets or phones with larger displays. The app teardown, courtesy of the Android Police, suggests that these new features could be made available soon via a server-side or an entire app update. Just keep in mind that Google could always just scrap them before they ever see the light of day. You can download the Google beta 6.10 .apk file here if you would like to install it and test it on your own device.

Last year, Google released versions of Google Assistant on three different products - the Pixel smartphones, Google Allo, and Google Home. Until now, the only way to interact with the Assistant outside the Allo app has been to use voice, but that may soon change. In its teardown session of APK file for a new beta version of Google app for Android, Android Police discovered that the keyboard-based input could be coming to the Google Assistant for the Pixel and Pixel XL. Presently, you can only communicate with Google Assistant through voice on Pixel smartphones. When this keyboard input feature finally arrives, a keyboard icon will start showing up while you interact with Google Assistant, and tapping on it will allow you to type your query. However, it still remains to be seen if there would be a difference between the sort of replies you get from Google Assistant with and without the keyboard input, though we'd be surprised if there was any difference. The APK file teardown also revealed Assistant could add support for Android Wear, but it's still not clear if this would only be for wearables paired with Pixel smartphones, or a wider range of phones. In addition, there's another feature that has been discovered in the teardown. It's a bare mention of 'search gestures' in the APK file, which suggests Google might be testing some gesture input feature in the Pixel launcher or Google Now launcher. It's not clear when these features will ship to all users. This week at the CES trade show, Google said that Assistant will now be making its way to supported Android TV devices in the US. Google's artificial intelligence-based digital assistant will be released for Nvidia's new Shield, as well as other Android TVs running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher, which includes AirTV Player, Sharp Aquos, Sony Bravia, and Xiaomi Mi Box.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Pixel 2: What Google smartphones really need to mix it up with the competition Here are the top features Google Pixel 2 needs to succeed Sami Khan   January 7, 2017 19:57 IST Google PixelScreenshot from Google Play Store Google put an end to the Nexus-era last year by beginning the reign of its Pixel series. The Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones were lauded for their hardware, design and software, especially the deep AI integration. Read: Smartphones we simply cannot wait to see in 2017: iPhone 8, Samsung Galaxy X, OnePlus 4 Since Google has taken control of the manufacturing process of its Android smartphone line, there are a lot of expectations from the web giant. The new Pixel series did live up to the expectations of many, but the phones lacked some essentials to compete against the likes of Apple and Samsung. The year 2017 will be the year for many tech companies to launch their new flagships. Samsung, for instance, will begin the race with its Galaxy S8 around MWC 2017 next month, followed by several other OEMs such as LG, OnePlus and the rest. Apple will finally conclude the year on a high note with the most-anticipated launch of the iPhone 8 series. Amidst all this, Google will steal some limelight again this year with the successor of Pixel and Pixel XL, and there will be a lot of people waiting to see what Google brings to the table. First of all, Google will need to consider some serious upgrades to stay on par with its closest rivals in the premium smartphone race. Below are the upgrades worth considering for the Pixel 2.... Waterproofing is essential With Apple and Samsung offering water- and dust-proofing for their flagships, it is essential Google ups the ante this year with its Pixel 2 smartphones. The Pixel 2 is most likely to offer IPS67 certification, upgrading from IP58, which is only valid for splashes instead of a full dip. 2K display to match rivals Well, it was surprising to see Google offer a Full HD display on the Pixel while offering 2K resolution for its Pixel XL phone. We would like to see Google make 2K screens standard for the Pixel 2 regardless of the size as most companies are offering it in premium flagships, take Samsung Galaxy S7 series for example. Dual camera will iron out many pixels Samsung is still not offering a dual camera setup, but it is likely to bring its best game this year. Apple has already made an example of its iPhone 7 Plus. Now it is up to Google to match its rivals. We strongly hope the Pixel 2 will feature dual camera with advanced imaging capabilities like AR. VR gaming will be a thing in 2017 Thanks to Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, VR gaming on flagship phones will be a lot easier. Google has an advantage over its rivals with its Daydream View, which offers advanced VR capabilities. We hope to see a second-gen Daydream View headset launch alongside Pixel 2, along with some compatible games this year. Hardware bump To round it off, Google will need a stronger spec-sheet. Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 CPU, 6GB RAM (minimum) and a better optimised battery will certainly be a welcome move by Google.

Russia requires LinkedIn be removed from Google, Apple app stores - Irish Sun Issue 016/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Russia requires LinkedIn be removed from Google, Apple app stores PanArmenian.Net Saturday 7th January, 2017 PanARMENIAN.Net - Smartphone users in Russia can no longer download the LinkedIn app on iPhone or Android devices, following a similar move in China to block The New York Times app on iPhones. The demand by Russian authorities to remove LinkedIn in Apple and Google app stores comes weeks after a court blocked the professional networking service for flouting local laws that require internet firms to store data on Russian citizens within the nation's borders, The New York Times reports. The action puts Apple and Google in a difficult position. The companies are strong proponents of open internet policies and free speech but are now being asked to be agents for governments that censor its citizens. When LinkedIn's website was blocked, the apps stopped functioning properly. Removing them from the Google Play store and Apple's App Store may not have cut off access to content, but it sent a signal that countries can push the tech giants to remove the apps. Direct blocking of websites has been done by China, Russia, Turkey and several other nations for years, usually through their state-run internet service providers. But civil rights groups say the pressure authoritarian governments are now placing on Apple and Google is a new wrinkle. "Apps are the new choke point of free expression," said Rebecca MacKinnon, who leads a project on open internet tracking at New America. Increasingly, United States tech companies are complying with those demands. In the early 2000s, American internet firms strongly pushed back on demands by China to comply with censorship rules within the country's internet controls, known as the Great Firewall. Recently, Facebook has been working on a censorship tool to be able to access China, where it is currently blocked along with Twitter and Google. LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, said it was "disappointed" with the decision by Russian regulators to block the service, which the company confirmed was extended to apps in Russian Apple and Google Play stores. "It denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses," said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn. Apple confirmed it was asked to remove its LinkedIn app in Russia about a month ago. It has also confirmed it was asked by China to block The New York Times app, but declined to comment further on both events. Google would not confirm it has removed LinkedIn in Russia but said it adheres to local laws in the countries in which it operates. More nations have enforced their own internet laws in recent years. Turkey intermittently blocks social media, such as during the attempted government coup last summer. It has also forced YouTube to remove content it considers disparaging of its modern-day founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. European nations have also drawn up their own privacy laws and in 2014 a court declared its citizens could demand internet companies like Google unlink information about users upon request. Tech companies and civil rights advocates warn that the increasing push by nations to create their own internet rules will Balkanize the internet and potentially lead to privacy violations and the stifling of political dissent. Other countries, however, criticize Silicon Valley and the United States government for setting the norms and rules for the internet. "Internet free speech and internet freedom are increasingly under attack all over the globe, and not just from authoritarian regimes," said Robert M. McDowell, a former member of the Federal Communications Commission and partner at Cooley law firm. "It appears to be a one-way ratchet with speech control getting tighter." LinkedIn has several million users in Russia, it said. In November, a Russian court ruled that the professional networking site broke local laws that require foreign internet firms to keep their servers holding information on Russian accounts within the nation. Most American internet companies in Russia operate in violation of the law, but without explanation, Russian regulators at a body known as Roskomnadzor took the rare step of enforcing its rules. The Russian regulators could not be immediately reached for comment. The action came at a tense moment in Russian-United States relations related to cyber affairs. Russia has been accused of hacking into American accounts, including the Democratic National Committee, to try to influence the presidential election. American intelligence officials concluded in a declassified report released on Friday that the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, ordered the campaign.

Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

On Friday, District Court Judge Helen Syme sentenced the 28-year-old to a maximum of three years and six months in prison for a range of offences, including making a false statement to police to hinder the discovery of evidence.

Dowidar, dressed neatly in jeans and a navy jumper with his dark hair slicked back, waved to his older brother and grinned broadly as he was led from the dock in the Downing Centre District Court.

The court found Dowidar lent his luxury white Lexus to another man to drive the de facto leader of Brothers For Life, Mohammed Hamzy, to the Greenacre street where gang member Yehya Amoud was shot dead in October 2012.

Dowidar told police shortly after the shooting that his four-wheel-drive "wasn't being driven" on the day and it was "home all day". SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Former Brothers For Life senior member Mohammed Hamzy. Photo: Supplied "This was clearly false and he knew it to be false," Judge Syme said. Months later, Dowidar reported the Lexus stolen and it was found burnt out. A witness told Dowidar's judge-alone trial the 4WD had to be destroyed as the gang was "concerned about it being bugged" by police after it was seized for forensic examination, Judge Syme said. In a scathing assessment, Judge Syme said Dowidar continued to "avoid responsibility" for his crimes and had "little respect" for the court or his own family. His "misguided loyalty to a violent person such as Mr Hamzy is not in his own or the community's best interests", she said. His lack of remorse or "acceptance of even the slightest responsibility" was "immature and self-defeating" and meant his prospects of rehabilitation in prison were "only hopeful". He had "not been offence-free" since the crimes and was caught driving while disqualified again in 2015. Judge Syme said while the replica pistol could not be fired it was "a good imitation, according to evidence before the court" and could be used to threaten people. She said corrective services should try to ensure Dowidar was "not housed with other Brothers for Life members" in jail. A jury found Hamzy guilty of manslaughter last year over the death of Mr Amoud. Judge Syme said there was "no sensible explanation" for Dowidar attending Hamzy's trial when he had been ordered not to associate with Brothers for Life members. Dowidar had already been sentenced for drug possession and driving while disqualified at the time of the shooting. Judge Syme said Dowidar had been "extended considerable leniency by the courts" in the past but had not taken advantage of it and was "not entitled to any leniency for this offence". At the time of his arrest in November 2013, Dowidar's solicitor cast his client as a boy from a middle-class Belmore home, with a clean criminal record save for a few driving offences. He had worked for Google through a contractor for five years, during which time the tech giant regularly topped the list of best places to work and had become known for its beanbag-filled meeting rooms, ping-pong tables and free cafeteria. His contract ended in May 2013. Judge Syme said his employment was "terminated at about the time his criminal offending escalated dramatically".  At Dowidar's bail hearing following his November 2013 arrest, Magistrate Elaine Truscott remarked he appeared to be "living a double life". Dowidar was one of 10 senior Brothers For Life members arrested during simultaneous raids across Sydney aimed at breaking up the group and ending a spate of shootings across the city. Picked up with Dowidar was Hamzy, the leader of the group's Bankstown chapter, who was also known as also known as "Little Crazy" of "LC". Throughout Hamzy's three-week trial the jury gained a small insight into the world of the now-defunct but once incredibly violent Brothers for Life gang. The street gang operated outside the law, bound by loyalties to each other. But when the long-time friends fell out, or rivalries arose, there were ways to take the law into their own hands. Hamzy was sentenced last October to 11 and a half years behind bars with a non-parole period of eight and a half years. with Ava Benny-Morrison and Nick Ralston WHO WERE BROTHERS FOR LIFE The violent street gang "Brothers for Life" first came to the attention of the NSW police in 2008, when convicted murderer Bassam Hamzy was caught running a sophisticated drug supply network while in Lithgow jail. Hamzy, who had been in custody since March 1999 for a series of crimes including drug supply, murder and conspiracy to murder, was able to make 19,523 calls using a mobile phone hidden in his cell to direct the drug deals between Sydney and Melbourne. It was during this time that the BFL "banner" as police called it, began to appear. Most of those who associated themselves with it were direct relatives of Hamzy and police believe the name was intended as a "show of support" and "loyalty" to their imprisoned "brother". A violent, internal feud within the gang erupted in 2013 resulting in a string of tit-for-tat shootings between the group's Blacktown and Bankstown chapters. The head of Blacktown chapter was Farhad Qaumi, nicknamed "The Afghan", was appointed as the BFL's "general" in 2012 by Bassam Hamzy. Hamzy's cousin, Mohammed Hamzy who was known as Little Crazy or LC was the head of the Bankstown Chapter. The internal war resulted in two killings, 11 shootings, two knee-cappings and several bashings. Police moved in, laying more than 300 charges against 21 members and in November 2014 senior officers declared that Brothers For Life had been dismantled. Clarification: an earlier version of this story described Dowidar as a Google employee. He was in fact contracted to the software giant through a third party.

Would turning to Google help? Seeing how it works for Google raises questions, but may also lead to some answers. By George Anadiotis for Big on Data | January 6, 2017 -- 17:32 GMT (09:32 PST) | Topic: Big Data Analytics Descriptive analytics -- looking into what has happened in the past -- is commoditized. Traditional BI, reports, and dashboards are well understood and used in one way or another across a wide spectrum of organizations to keep an eye on their operations. Predictive analytics -- trying to predict what will happen in the future -- is in the limelight. Today many organizations are scrambling to utilize predictive models leveraging data and Machine Learning (ML) in the hope that this will empower them to anticipate future developments. Prescriptive analytics is different. Neither what it is nor how it's supposed to work are entirely clear. So when faced with questions, would turning to Google help answer them? Let's have a look at YouTube, the most massive and widely used media channel on the planet, as a case study to examine prescriptive analytics. Everyone, meet prescriptive analytics special feature IoT: The Security Challenge The Internet of Things is creating serious new security risks. We examine the possibilities and the dangers. Read More Gartner's definition of prescriptive analytics is "a form of advanced analytics which examines data or content to answer the question "What should be done?" or "What can we do to make _______ happen?", and is characterized by techniques such as graph analysis, simulation, complex event processing, neural networks, recommendation engines, heuristics, and machine learning." Cryptic much? Lisa Kart, Gartner analyst, offered a more tangible approach by stating that "Prescriptive analytics is about applying logic and mathematics to data, with the goal to specify a preferred course of action- unlike other types of analytics the output is a decision." So the result of applying prescriptive analytics is not information about the past, not predictions about the future, but decisions. But establishing this as the definition of prescriptive analytics is just the onset for more questions. To begin with, while the definition of predictive analytics does not really expand on the technical approaches of applying it, the definition of predictive analytics goes to some lengths to list an array of potential techniques. Why the difference? And does using any of the listed techniques in and of itself qualify an analytics solution as "prescriptive analytics"? One interpretation for the emphasis on technologies in Gartner's definition is that unlike predictive analytics, for which using ML seems to be a given, prescriptive analytics is fluid, less anchored, and perhaps less understood at this point. At any rate, solutions using any of the technologies listed should not be awarded the "prescriptive" moniker based on this criterion alone. There are other questions to ask that can perhaps serve better as criteria for classification. Bottomless bowls, infinite feeds, and autoplay The more videos users watch, the better for Google's bottom line. Hence, recommendations are an important part of YouTube. Image: Tristan Harris Other questions such as, which decision exactly are we talking about here? What are the options to choose from, and who makes the decision? For sure, being able to predict the future helps with decisions. But doesn't a decision imply action in the future anyway? So where exactly are the boundaries between predictive and prescriptive? When faced with overwhelming questions, people often turn to Google. This could possibly help in this case too, although not in the way Google is often used. Google is -- among other things -- the proud owner of YouTube. An iconic example of a data-powered product by a data-powered organization. The product, in typical Google fashion, is advertisements paid for by third parties and targeting consumers -- users viewing YouTube content. Every YouTube video is viewed alongside advertisements, which consumers occasionally click, bringing advertisement revenue to Google. This business model has some interesting implications. It implies that the more videos users will watch, the more advertisements they will be shown, and the higher the chances some of them will be clicked. Therefore, the more videos users consume, the more revenue for Google. So answers to the question "What can we do to make people watch more videos" are of great interest for Google. Apparently "show them more videos they will like" ranked high among other options. Tristan Harris, ex-design ethicist at Google, elaborated on design hacks used to this effect, including what he called "bottomless bowls, infinite feeds, and autoplay." But at the end of the day, if the content is not relevant, how much good can such hacks do? Case in point -- there has been a fair amount of criticism on the relevance of YouTube recommended videos. Google, meet the analytics continuum YouTube's latest recommendation engine features 2 layers of Deep Learning that enable it to sort through complex combinations of video factors. Is this prescriptive analytics? Image: Covington/Adams/Sargin - Google Google responded by revamping YouTube's recommendation engine. Previously, recommended videos on YouTube have been served based on the same principles driving Amazon's recommendation engine. The architecture and techniques utilized in YouTube's recommendation engine have been outlined in a paper recently published by Google engineers. Who really owns your Internet of Things data? In a world where more and more objects are coming online and vendors are getting involved in the supply chain, how can you keep track of what's yours and what's not? Read More Google uses two layers of deep neural networks to narrow down the immense stock of YouTube videos to a ranked list of recommendations. Recommendation generation is modeled as (extreme) multiclass classification, producing an initial pool of recommendations subsequently ranked using logistic regression. So how would that be classified then? Definitely not descriptive analytics, but is it predictive or prescriptive? Depending on how one looks at it, it might as well be either. As per another definition, "the prescriptive approach analyzes potential decisions, the interactions between decisions, the influences that bear upon these decisions and the bearing all of the above has on an outcome to ultimately prescribe an optimal course of action in real time." One cited example is airline ticket pricing systems that use prescriptive analytics to sort through complex combinations of travel factors, demand levels, and purchase timing to present potential passengers with prices designed to optimize profits but also not deter sales One could argue that this is about making predictions about what users will like, so it's predictive. One could also argue that this is about helping Google answer the "What can we do to make people watch more videos" question, and sorting through complex combinations of video factors, so it's prescriptive. One could probably argue over definitions for a long time, which goes to show that using he descriptive-predictive-prescriptive classification can be hard. Not only does it look and feel more like a continuum than a set of discrete classes, but the progression in the continuum is not entirely straightforward either. Great -- but does it work? Having explicit feedback matters for the development of YouTube recommendations, which is why Google set out to get it. Image: Corbin Davenport / Android Police So how well is the new recommendation engine performing? Opinions vary apparently. Striving for improvement, Google has explicitly sought after user feedback. Spontaneous, public user feedback however appears to be mostly negative at this time. On the other hand, there have also been some positive remarks, specifically about the next to watch feature. As this presumably is the top-ranked result of the engine, maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel. Anecdotal evidence from people with tastes in music ranging from eclectic to mainstream also points towards a sometimes surprising aptitude to auto-compile engaging playlists as of late. So the jury on what this is and whether it works is still out. However there are still many aspects regarding the intricacies and alternatives in implementing YouTube's call-them-what-you-will analytics that are worth exploring, and we will continue to do so on our tour in the land of the analytics continuum.

At the beginning a user had to interact with levers and switches, then came screens and DOS, the Apple’s Macintosh and Microsoft’s Windows, and, finally, the internet. These slowly wormed their way into our lives and changed the way we do almost everything. But the OS of the future is going to be something different entirely. The next step is artificial intelligence, and there’s a land rush going on. Just think of how profitable Microsoft’s control of the previous epoch was. How operating systems evolved In the 70s, many of us cut our teeth with command line systems like MS-DOS, CP/M and Unix. Just imagine the black screens with green type. You could type almost meaningful commands like “cp” to copy a file. This was pretty geeky, but a little less than physical switches. In the 80s, computing moved over to graphical interfaces like Mac OS and Windows where you could simply point and click. Want to delete a file? Simply drag it into the bin. What could be simpler? Computing was no longer just for geeks. Almost anyone could do it. In the 90s, computing became more connected. The internet took off and the browser became king. Indeed, Google have made a whole Operating System out of this, Chrome OS. And more recently, computing became mobile and moved onto apps on our smartphones. Some of these apps and services started branching out, creating their own little worlds to bring together developers and users. There is probably no better example than the Chinese app WeChat, which has thousands of applications, from social networking through buying airline tickets. You might not realize it but the next revolution in Operating Systems is now under way. And the technology giants like Microsoft, Apple and Google are racing to be the winner. The new race Late last year Google announced a series of hardware products. There was Google Home speaker, Pixel smartphone, and the virtual reality headset Daydream View. But Google isn’t going to make billions out of hardware like this. Software is a much better business to be in. It scales so much more easily. No, Google is producing this hardware just as a means of getting its AI-based Google Assistant into our homes and our pockets. Assistant is baked into all of these products, and through it, Google wants to be at the centre of our lives, however we connect. Conversational assistants like Assistant and Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa are the Operating System of the future. No more typing. No more pointing. The power of Artificial Intelligence will be harnessed to serve our needs. “Get me on the next flight to Canberra, Google”. “Who’s the President of Switzerland, Siri?” “Play me that jazz saxonophist that I like, Alexa.” In many cases, there won’t be a keyboard in sight. We’ll walk into some new room and say “Turn on the lights” and expect someone will be listening. Sorry, something will be listening. We’ll sit it our car and simply announce “start the ignition”. We’ll get into a lift and command “top floor, please”. We’ll walk into the bathroom and say “run me a bath”. Screens will disappear. In its place, will be conversations. Conversations that will follow us from room to room, to car, to office and to bed. The knock on effects of all this will be huge. The loss of screens will mean digital advertising must be rethought. The rise of conversation will impact search and online networking. Whoever wins the race to define this new operating system will take the lead in all of this. Winners and losers This is an exciting future. There are plenty of opportunities for the bold. To build a watch that doubles as your personal assistant. Sunglasses that tell you when you’ve had too much sun. A weighing scale that offers advice about your diet. The likely winners are companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or Amazon because they are the first movers, and the theory of network effects mean their products will likely rapidly improve. The likely losers are privacy, diversity and democracy. The NSA can’t wait for every room to be listening. Marketers can’t wait to see all this data on our everyday lives.

Credit: Linksys More like this 9 Alexa tips and tricks With Ford, Amazon's Alexa hits the road Why Google A.I. is the last user interface Video Mingis on Tech: New year, new CES -- and new AirPods Amazon's Alexa won CES this week. Amazon's virtual assistant, which first appeared more than two years ago on Amazon's Echo smart speaker, seemed to be popping up everywhere at the annual International CES trade show in Las Vegas this week. Amazon opened Alexa to third-party hardware developers in the summer of 2015. Now, a year and a half later, the number of devices that support Alexa are dizzying. (We also learned this week that Alexa now offers more than 7,000 "skills," which is what Amazon calls apps or third-party capabilities.) The chatter about Alexa at CES is broadly muddled, with reporters talking about devices "supporting Alexa." But not all "support" is created equal. Most of this "support" is relative banal. It means that a smart device gains the ability to be controlled or monitored through Alexa. Appliance maker Whirlpool, for example, announced this week a new line of home appliances available in "early 2017" that respond to Alexa commands. They'll let you change the temperature of your Whirlpool refrigerator by telling Alexa. And the virtual assistant will be able to tell you if your Whirlpool washer and dryer is running and how much time is left before the clothes are done. LG The LG Smart InstaView fridge has Alexa support built in. It's like a giant Amazon Echo that also keeps your food cold. Dish Network's Hopper DVR boxes are getting Alexa control. As with Apple TV, you'll be able to use voice commands and conversation to find shows and change the channel. ADT Pulse also got Alexa support this week. After February, users will be able to arm and disarm their home alarm security systems and deadbolts by talking to Alexa. Access to the security system is granted when you speak a four-digit PIN code. Of course, when you speak a PIN code, others can hear it, then later use it from outside the house (if they yell loud enough) to disable the security system. Users should be careful with this one. We also learned this week that Alexa support is being extended to the Belkin WeMo Dimmer Wi-Fi light switch and WeMo Mini; Carrier Cor 5C and 7C Smart Thermostats; Element, Sieki and Westinghouse smart TVs; First Alert OneLink Environment Monitor; the Incipio CommandKit Wi-Fi light switch and Wireless smart power strip; Vobot Clock; iHome's iAVS16 bedside speaker; SkylinkNet™ connected home suite; Coway's Airmega smart air purifier; Hubble Hugo mood-tracking smart camera; Sensory VoiceGenie; Jam Audio speakers; Bixi gesture controller and other devices. I like this brand of "Alexa" support. But it's not nearly as interesting and culture-changing as the other kind: When devices actually deliver Alexa itself. Alexa appliances at CES The Lenovo Smart Assistant, for example, is just like Amazon's own Echo, but with better sound. Omaker Wow Wireless Wifi Portable Bluetooth Speakers with Amazon Alexa are also straight-up alternatives to Amazon's Echo, Echo Dot and Tap devices. Two devices, the Nabi Aristotle (Nabi is a Mattel company) and the C-Way Memoo are Amazon-Echo like devices for children. These are proving controversial because the idea of a corporation listening in on children is creepy to some parents. They can read stories to children and broadly function as a kind of robot babysitter, to a limited degree. While Echo alternatives are welcome, they're not nearly as interesting and surprising as some of the other new appliances delivering Alexa. When Google announced its OnHub router in 2015 and Google WiFi mesh routers last year, a few pundits asked: "Why didn't they put Google Now or the Google Assistant on these routers?" It's a good question. But at CES, Linksys became the first company to announce the idea of a virtual assistant on a mesh router system. The company unveiled this week it's Linksys Velop Whole Home Wi-Fi system. The mesh routers provide full coverage in a home by creating a chain of wireless connectivity, which extends Wi-Fi more broadly in a home than a single router can. The Linksys Velop ships Jan. 15 in packs of one ($200), two ($350) or three ($500). Each router provides the speaker and microphone needed to interact with Alexa. A company called Ubtech Robotics unveiled a robot called Lynx at CES that has Alexa inside. The robot has its own capabilities unrelated to Alexa, such as the ability to recognize faces and demonstrate fitness exercises, but also functions just like an Amazon Echo. LG also announced an Alexa robot at CES. The company didn't provide all the details, but the Hub robot appears to be a small robot that simply functions as an Amazon Echo type device, but with a personality, expressed through its round display and ability to swivel to face whomever is talking to it. Unlike the Whirlpool refrigerator, which can be minimally controlled by Alexa commands, LG announced a fridge that actually functions as an Alexa device. The LG Smart InstaView fridge has a camera inside so you can check what you need while you're at the store, and also a screen on the outside. The screen is interesting: By tapping on the screen twice, it becomes a transparent window so you can see what's inside without opening the door. Gadget fans will also be intrigued by the operating system that powers some of the smart features: It's WebOS! (The WebOS operating system evolved from the Palm WebOS system that used to power Palm smartphones and tablets.) Chinese smartphone giant Huawei announced at CES that its $599.99 Mate 9 phablet would become the first smartphone to ship with Alexa integration pre-installed and integrated. While Alexa is available in a smattering of mobile apps for both Android and iOS platforms, the Huawei integration appears to offer "always-listening" hands-free access to Alexa. All these new Alexa appliances join several announced last year, including a lamp called the C by GE. I really like this idea because, as I said in this space a year ago, lights and light bulbs are uniquely suitable as locations for virtual assistants. One line of products shown at CES functions both as an Alexa-controlled device and an Alexa appliance: Ford cars. The first implementation will show up in the Focus Electric, Fusion Energi, and C-Max Energi cars. Ford Sync Connect users will gain the ability to start, lock or unlock the doors, and get information about the car from any Alexa device. Later this summer, Alexa itself will be made available in Ford cars, so you can interact with Alexa from inside the car, including the ability to control the audio system with voice commands. The car dashboard works like an Amazon Echo. When virtual assistants are everywhere and always listening Let's be clear about what's happening with virtual assistants. As I predicted in this space in 2014, within a few years, you will almost never be out of virtual assistant range. When you talk, they will hear you. You won't even have to think about which device is serving you. Just ask a question and a voice will answer. There are two ways to achieve this: The Apple way and the Amazon way. The Apple way is to serve up its Siri virtual assistant primarily as a feature on mobile devices like the iPhone and the Apple Watch (two exceptions are the stationary Apple TV and iMac). By choosing "Allow 'Hey Siri' " in the settings of an iPhone, your phone is always listening for the "Hey Siri" command. Everywhere you go, Siri is listening, as long as you bring your iPhone. The Amazon way is to offer Alexa Echo appliances for every room in the house and also open its virtual assistant to hardware developers so Amazon is built into every appliance, vehicle and object in the home and office. The Google way, meanwhile, is to do both at the same time -- get a virtual assistant into every phone, on every computer and also open to third parties. Google is more than a year behind Amazon in third-party integration. The biggest challenge for Google in this space is Google itself. Google's virtual assistant strategy is muddled and confusing. Quick, what's Google's virtual assistant? Is it the Google Assistant? Or is it Google Now? And what is Google Voice Search? Isn't Google Assistant mostly just Google Voice Search? Who knows? Regardless, Amazon and Google will get virtual assistants into just about every category of internet of things device. You'll talk to the fridge. You'll talk to the toaster. You'll talk to the toilet. Everything will be listening. Everything will know you, guide you, inform you, entertain you and do things for you. As everything continues moving to the cloud, our virtual assistants will become our main interface to the cloud -- which is to say our main interface to everything. As Star Trekish and awesome as this will be, you can be sure that new problems will arise. Alexa-powered devices, such as Amazon's own Echo appliance, are always listening for a "wake word" -- the word that triggers the device to listen for other commands and requests. Alexa's "wake word" is "Alexa," or alternatively "Amazon." (This is a bummer for one Reddit user, who claims that he has two daughters named "Alexa" and "Amazon."). Virtual assistants will end the use of "Alexa" or "Siri" as names for children or pets. The assistants everywhere world will raise new issues around privacy and security.

Twitter Facebook Everything is a virtual assistant now At CES, we're learning that virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa will be delivered as a utility to almost every appliance in your home. Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 07 January, 2017 23:00 - - - - print email Comments Amazon's Alexa won CES this week. Amazon's virtual assistant, which first appeared more than two years ago on Amazon's Echo smart speaker, seemed to be popping up everywhere at the annual International CES trade show in Las Vegas this week. Amazon opened Alexa to third-party hardware developers in the summer of 2015. Now, a year and a half later, the number of devices that support Alexa are dizzying. (We also learned this week that Alexa now offers more than 7,000 "skills," which is what Amazon calls apps or third-party capabilities.) The chatter about Alexa at CES is broadly muddled, with reporters talking about devices "supporting Alexa." But not all "support" is created equal. Most of this "support" is relative banal. It means that a smart device gains the ability to be controlled or monitored through Alexa. Appliance maker Whirlpool, for example, announced this week a new line of home appliances available in "early 2017" that respond to Alexa commands. They'll let you change the temperature of your Whirlpool refrigerator by telling Alexa. And the virtual assistant will be able to tell you if your Whirlpool washer and dryer is running and how much time is left before the clothes are done. LG The LG Smart InstaView fridge has Alexa support built in. It's like a giant Amazon Echo that also keeps your food cold. Dish Network's Hopper DVR boxes are getting Alexa control. As with Apple TV, you'll be able to use voice commands and conversation to find shows and change the channel. ADT Pulse also got Alexa support this week. After February, users will be able to arm and disarm their home alarm security systems and deadbolts by talking to Alexa. Access to the security system is granted when you speak a four-digit PIN code. Of course, when you speak a PIN code, others can hear it, then later use it from outside the house (if they yell loud enough) to disable the security system. Users should be careful with this one. We also learned this week that Alexa support is being extended to the Belkin WeMo Dimmer Wi-Fi light switch and WeMo Mini; Carrier Cor 5C and 7C Smart Thermostats; Element, Sieki and Westinghouse smart TVs; First Alert OneLink Environment Monitor; the Incipio CommandKit Wi-Fi light switch and Wireless smart power strip; Vobot Clock; iHome's iAVS16 bedside speaker; SkylinkNet™ connected home suite; Coway's Airmega smart air purifier; Hubble Hugo mood-tracking smart camera; Sensory VoiceGenie; Jam Audio speakers; Bixi gesture controller and other devices. I like this brand of "Alexa" support. But it's not nearly as interesting and culture-changing as the other kind: When devices actually deliver Alexa itself. Alexa appliances at CES The Lenovo Smart Assistant, for example, is just like Amazon's own Echo, but with better sound. Omaker Wow Wireless Wifi Portable Bluetooth Speakers with Amazon Alexa are also straight-up alternatives to Amazon's Echo, Echo Dot and Tap devices. Two devices, the Nabi Aristotle (Nabi is a Mattel company) and the C-Way Memoo are Amazon-Echo like devices for children. These are proving controversial because the idea of a corporation listening in on children is creepy to some parents. They can read stories to children and broadly function as a kind of robot babysitter, to a limited degree. While Echo alternatives are welcome, they're not nearly as interesting and surprising as some of the other new appliances delivering Alexa. When Google announced its OnHub router in 2015 and Google WiFi mesh routers last year, a few pundits asked: "Why didn't they put Google Now or the Google Assistant on these routers?" It's a good question. But at CES, Linksys became the first company to announce the idea of a virtual assistant on a mesh router system. The company unveiled this week it's Linksys Velop Whole Home Wi-Fi system. The mesh routers provide full coverage in a home by creating a chain of wireless connectivity, which extends Wi-Fi more broadly in a home than a single router can. The Linksys Velop ships Jan. 15 in packs of one ($200), two ($350) or three ($500). Each router provides the speaker and microphone needed to interact with Alexa. A company called Ubtech Robotics unveiled a robot called Lynx at CES that has Alexa inside. The robot has its own capabilities unrelated to Alexa, such as the ability to recognize faces and demonstrate fitness exercises, but also functions just like an Amazon Echo. LG also announced an Alexa robot at CES. The company didn't provide all the details, but the Hub robot appears to be a small robot that simply functions as an Amazon Echo type device, but with a personality, expressed through its round display and ability to swivel to face whomever is talking to it. Unlike the Whirlpool refrigerator, which can be minimally controlled by Alexa commands, LG announced a fridge that actually functions as an Alexa device. The LG Smart InstaView fridge has a camera inside so you can check what you need while you're at the store, and also a screen on the outside. The screen is interesting: By tapping on the screen twice, it becomes a transparent window so you can see what's inside without opening the door. Gadget fans will also be intrigued by the operating system that powers some of the smart features: It's WebOS! (The WebOS operating system evolved from the Palm WebOS system that used to power Palm smartphones and tablets.) Chinese smartphone giant Huawei announced at CES that its $599.99 Mate 9 phablet would become the first smartphone to ship with Alexa integration pre-installed and integrated. While Alexa is available in a smattering of mobile apps for both Android and iOS platforms, the Huawei integration appears to offer "always-listening" hands-free access to Alexa. All these new Alexa appliances join several announced last year, including a lamp called the C by GE. I really like this idea because, as I said in this space a year ago, lights and light bulbs are uniquely suitable as locations for virtual assistants. One line of products shown at CES functions both as an Alexa-controlled device and an Alexa appliance: Ford cars. The first implementation will show up in the Focus Electric, Fusion Energi, and C-Max Energi cars. Ford Sync Connect users will gain the ability to start, lock or unlock the doors, and get information about the car from any Alexa device. Later this summer, Alexa itself will be made available in Ford cars, so you can interact with Alexa from inside the car, including the ability to control the audio system with voice commands. The car dashboard works like an Amazon Echo. When virtual assistants are everywhere and always listening Let's be clear about what's happening with virtual assistants. As I predicted in this space in 2014, within a few years, you will almost never be out of virtual assistant range. When you talk, they will hear you. You won't even have to think about which device is serving you. Just ask a question and a voice will answer. There are two ways to achieve this: The Apple way and the Amazon way. The Apple way is to serve up its Siri virtual assistant primarily as a feature on mobile devices like the iPhone and the Apple Watch (two exceptions are the stationary Apple TV and iMac). By choosing "Allow 'Hey Siri' " in the settings of an iPhone, your phone is always listening for the "Hey Siri" command. Everywhere you go, Siri is listening, as long as you bring your iPhone. The Amazon way is to offer Alexa Echo appliances for every room in the house and also open its virtual assistant to hardware developers so Amazon is built into every appliance, vehicle and object in the home and office. The Google way, meanwhile, is to do both at the same time -- get a virtual assistant into every phone, on every computer and also open to third parties. Google is more than a year behind Amazon in third-party integration. The biggest challenge for Google in this space is Google itself. Google's virtual assistant strategy is muddled and confusing. Quick, what's Google's virtual assistant? Is it the Google Assistant? Or is it Google Now? And what is Google Voice Search? Isn't Google Assistant mostly just Google Voice Search? Who knows? Regardless, Amazon and Google will get virtual assistants into just about every category of internet of things device. You'll talk to the fridge. You'll talk to the toaster. You'll talk to the toilet. Everything will be listening. Everything will know you, guide you, inform you, entertain you and do things for you. As everything continues moving to the cloud, our virtual assistants will become our main interface to the cloud -- which is to say our main interface to everything. As Star Trekish and awesome as this will be, you can be sure that new problems will arise. Alexa-powered devices, such as Amazon's own Echo appliance, are always listening for a "wake word" -- the word that triggers the device to listen for other commands and requests. Alexa's "wake word" is "Alexa," or alternatively "Amazon." (This is a bummer for one Reddit user, who claims that he has two daughters named "Alexa" and "Amazon.").

Google to Shut Down Hangouts API on April 25 GO After April 25, apps in Hangouts will stop working Jan 7, 2017 11:45 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google has just announced that it decided to shut down Hangouts API starting April 25, 2017. This means that all applications using the Hangouts API will no longer work after the date. In a post on the Hangouts API platform, Google announced that it would retire the Google+ Hangouts API, which allows developers to create apps for the older version of Hangouts video calls. The API was initially developed to support social experiences for end-users, as part of Google+. However, Hangouts is now changing and Google wants the app to focus on enterprise consumption more. “We understand this will impact developers who have invested in our platform. We have carefully considered this change and believe that the latest updates allow us to give our users a more targeted Hangouts desktop video experience going forward,” Google said in a post. A small number of apps will continue to function The report also mentions that a few apps will continue to function past April 25, including DialPad and RingCentral apps for dialing into a call or integration with Slack, another enterprise communications tool. In addition, Hangouts on Air broadcasting tools, like Toolbox, Control Room and Cameraman will continue to run. Users of apps containing the Hangouts API will receive a notice informing them that the app will no longer work after April 25. Back in September 2016, Google did showcase new features for Hangouts, aimed mainly at meetings and conference calls. Google has already started to replace Hangouts with Allo in the package of pre-installed apps on Android phones. Allo offers both video and messaging tools, and it comes with integrated Google Assistant. Just yesterday, we reported that Google acquired Limes Audio to improve the quality of video conference calls in Hangouts, another proof that the company’s Hangouts app is heading in the direction of enterprise users. #Google#Hangouts#Allo#Google+#Slack subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Assistant on Pixel Phones to Get Support for Keyboard Input Google Makes Gboard App Official, Up for Download in the Play Store Google Renames Keyboard App for Android to Gboard, Adds New Features Google Details Android 7.1.1 Nougat's New Features and Improvements It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs Linux Kernel 4.9.4 Released with Various ARM/ARM64 and Networking Improvements    Google Hangouts logo New Android APKs imo APK: Updated January 15th, 18:31 GMT AndroDumpper APK: Updated January 15th, 18:29 GMT MCPE Master APK: Updated January 15th, 18:27 GMT SuperSU APK: Updated January 15th, 18:24 GMT Geekbench 4 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:20 GMT Xbox Beta APK: Updated January 15th, 18:17 GMT Action Launcher 3 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:14 GMT Reader comments Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 more on: MWC 2017 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The new ‘Goals’ feature in Google Calendar will help users find time for ‘the things that matter’. Google says that you can set a goal, for example ‘run three times a week” and Calendar will find the time for you in your schedule and also help you stick to it. Starting today, users can connected their Google Calendar to Apple Health and Google Fit. After doing so, the activity your fitness apps record will be used to mark your goals in Google Calendar as “Done” automatically. “If you’re setting out to achieve a goal, seeing progress can be a great motivation. Goals in Google Calendar makes finding time for activities like hitting the gym or going on more runs easy. But it hasn’t been as easy to track whether you’re reaching that goal — even if you’re using fitness tracking apps in parallel — since you still have to manually mark your goal “Done” every time,” Google explained in a blogpost. Google says that with this integration, future goal times can be even more tailored made based on when you are most likely to complete them.

The demand by Russian authorities to remove LinkedIn in Apple and Google app stores comes weeks after a court blocked the professional networking service for flouting local laws that require internet firms to store data on Russian citizens within the nation’s borders, The New York Times reports. The action puts Apple and Google in a difficult position. The companies are strong proponents of open internet policies and free speech but are now being asked to be agents for governments that censor its citizens. When LinkedIn’s website was blocked, the apps stopped functioning properly. Removing them from the Google Play store and Apple’s App Store may not have cut off access to content, but it sent a signal that countries can push the tech giants to remove the apps. Direct blocking of websites has been done by China, Russia, Turkey and several other nations for years, usually through their state-run internet service providers. But civil rights groups say the pressure authoritarian governments are now placing on Apple and Google is a new wrinkle. “Apps are the new choke point of free expression,” said Rebecca MacKinnon, who leads a project on open internet tracking at New America. Increasingly, United States tech companies are complying with those demands. In the early 2000s, American internet firms strongly pushed back on demands by China to comply with censorship rules within the country’s internet controls, known as the Great Firewall. Recently, Facebook has been working on a censorship tool to be able to access China, where it is currently blocked along with Twitter and Google. LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, said it was “disappointed” with the decision by Russian regulators to block the service, which the company confirmed was extended to apps in Russian Apple and Google Play stores. “It denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,” said Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn. Apple confirmed it was asked to remove its LinkedIn app in Russia about a month ago. It has also confirmed it was asked by China to block The New York Times app, but declined to comment further on both events. Google would not confirm it has removed LinkedIn in Russia but said it adheres to local laws in the countries in which it operates. More nations have enforced their own internet laws in recent years. Turkey intermittently blocks social media, such as during the attempted government coup last summer. It has also forced YouTube to remove content it considers disparaging of its modern-day founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. European nations have also drawn up their own privacy laws and in 2014 a court declared its citizens could demand internet companies like Google unlink information about users upon request. Tech companies and civil rights advocates warn that the increasing push by nations to create their own internet rules will Balkanize the internet and potentially lead to privacy violations and the stifling of political dissent. Other countries, however, criticize Silicon Valley and the United States government for setting the norms and rules for the internet. “Internet free speech and internet freedom are increasingly under attack all over the globe, and not just from authoritarian regimes,” said Robert M. McDowell, a former member of the Federal Communications Commission and partner at Cooley law firm. “It appears to be a one-way ratchet with speech control getting tighter.” LinkedIn has several million users in Russia, it said. In November, a Russian court ruled that the professional networking site broke local laws that require foreign internet firms to keep their servers holding information on Russian accounts within the nation. Most American internet companies in Russia operate in violation of the law, but without explanation, Russian regulators at a body known as Roskomnadzor took the rare step of enforcing its rules. The Russian regulators could not be immediately reached for comment. The action came at a tense moment in Russian-United States relations related to cyber affairs. Russia has been accused of hacking into American accounts, including the Democratic National Committee, to try to influence the presidential election. American intelligence officials concluded in a declassified report released on Friday that the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, ordered the campaign. Related links: The New York Times.

Fleming was living through a time of great change. Massive immigration to North America meant that not only were more people were moving, but thanks to steam engines, were doing it more quickly.  Read more Canada says high-speed Internet is essential for quality of life Technological advances also included communications, and it was easier to quickly pass messages across vast distances.    Fleming wrote in 1876: “Within a comparatively recent period, the human race has acquired a control over a power which already has, in a remarkable degree, changed the condition of human affairs. “The application of steam to a locomotive by land and water has given enormous stimulus to progress throughout the world, and with the electric telegraph as auxiliary, has somewhat rudely shaken customs and habits which have been handed down to us by bygone centuries. “We still cling, however, to the system of Chronometry inherited from a remote antiquity.” Namely, people tended to use the location of the sun in the sky to tell the time.  World news in pictures 47 show all World news in pictures 1/47 12 January 2017 A former Filipino comfort woman shouts slogans as she joins a protest rally in front of the Japanese embassy in Pasay City, south of Manila, Philippines, ahead of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's official visit EPA 2/47 12 January 2017 Supporters and family members of Filipina 'comfort women', who were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II, display banners during a protest in front of the Japanese embassy in Manila, hours before the arrival of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Getty 3/47 12 January 2017 Supporters and family members of Filipina 'comfort women', who were forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II, display banners during a protest in front of the Japanese embassy in Manila, hours before the arrival of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Getty 4/47 12 January 2017 Polish Commander of the 11th Lubuska Armoured Cavalry Division from Zagan General Jaroslaw Mika gives a speech during the official welcome ceremony of the US troops convoy in Zagan, western Poland.

However, as he journeyed west through the country, his watch was increasingly inaccurate.

In 1879 in Canada, he proposed the ideas in Terrestrial Time: That the world should be divided into 24 equal time zones, beginning with the commonly used Greenwich Mean Time from Britain, all centred around a hypothetical clock.  Fleming’s ideas led to the International Prime Meridian Conference in 1884, at which 26 powerful governments – including the British Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the United States, Japan and the German Empire – agreed to adopt the principles of the system.  While his work on time zones remains Fleming’s legacy, he contributed extensively to Canada’s development through his engineering work on the railways. He also produced numerous maps and surveys and designed the country’s first postage stamp.  More about: Sandford Fleming google doodle Chronometry Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Legere’s first prediction for 2017 is that cable companies will try to enter wireless through MVNO deals, but that they’ll fail. Legere adds that because of this, T-Mobile will not get into any MVNO deals with cable companies. Cable companies are the only ones that’ll try to get into wireless in 2017, Legere suggests, as he thinks that “a MAJOR new player will jump in and shake up US wireless in a MAJOR way.” The T-Mo CEO specifically guesses that Google will “go for the mobile moonshot.” Google offers wireless service through Project Fi, which runs on the T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular networks, but Legere appears to think that Google will take things a step farther in 2017. Sticking with the topic of other companies, Legere thinks that Dish will be no more this year after it missed its opportunity to enter wireless using its supply of spectrum. Moving on to television shows, Legere predicts that the majority of TV watching will happen on mobile by the end of 2017. More than one-third of TV viewing happens on something other than a TV, Legere says, with that number jumping to 50 percent for people under 25. And T-Mo’s CEO expects those numbers to continue to grow. The second TV-related prediction from Legere is that content built for OTT and mobile consumption, like his Slow Cooker Sunday show, will pass cable channels in number of viewers. Specifically, Legere thinks that his Slow Cooker Sunday show will get a weekly audience of 1 million viewers by the end of 2017. The show currently pulls in more than 500,000 viewers each week. Rounding out John’s 2017 predictions are gigabit LTE speeds, which T-Mobile touts that it’s nearly achieved in lab testing; a wireless CEO shuffle that’ll see three of the four current CEOs exiting their positions this year; and merger discussions between Verizon and Comcast as a way to help Comcast get into wireless. While John didn’t make any specific predictions about T-Mobile’s network, it seems likely that T-Mo will continue to build out its LTE coverage in 2017. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray said yesterday that T-Mo plans to cover 320 million POPs with LTE in 2017, up from the 313 million covered at the end of 2016. Ray also said that T-Mobile currently reaches 251 million people with its Extended Range LTE coverage and that that number will grow in the first half of 2017. So what do you think of all these predictions? Do you have any that you’d like to add?

The prospect of that being the year end coverage map is so very exciting! Mark Kendrick I’m amazed myself by the improvement in their network in just the last year. I tried TMO last year for a couple of months but bailed because the service wasn’t very good, a year later and I’m quite satisfied Edward Ward Over the past year I have seen my coverage improve tremendously, to the point where I now have coverage on par with my wife who is Verizon loyal. Jason Caprio Those are some nice coverage predictions. I’ll believe it when I see it. I hope to see the day when T-Mobile ties/beats Verizon in rootmetrics, then I’ll switch back! I’m rooting for T-Mobile all the way! Cellphone Chris The cable MVNO thing isn’t a prediction, it’s already been announced. Those that know what I’m talking about understand that a merger between Verizon and Comcast seems highly unlikely. a d00d With Republicans in control of all 3 houses (Capitol Hill House, Senate, and White House), this merger is very much a possibility. In fact, depending on how fast they change things, I could even call it certain. Evil attracts Evil, after all. And I wonder how many board members are shared? Of course, we’ll all suffer for it, along with a TMo merger, but that’s the way it goes. At least we should be rid of Obamacare… Acdc1a We have no idea what is to come. A Republican wasn’t elected President, a populist was. If popular opinion is against the idea, it doesn’t go through. If it’s well sold to the public, it will. Linx I can’t see myself on any other carrier than T-Mobile right now. Richard Roma That’s interesting, I’m on the opposite end where I feel like evaluating other options. I don’t like this One only push at all. Jay Holm This coming April I will have been with T-Mobile for 4 full years. Very happy customer. Walt Get ride of the 3G hspa and use that spectrum for LTE. Keep 2G edge for all the flip phones and m2m Andrew Singleton keeping any 2g is a horrible idea. tmo’s new flip phone is LTE. a d00d Andrew, you need to re-read about IoT in the article earlier in the week. Walt, the problem is that many of the IoT resellers have been nudging these guys onto 3G as a cheaper measure than going directly to LTE as most companies only think of the short haul (bottom line for this quarter or year only) versus the long haul (let someone else pay for it). Plus there are a huge number of 3G handsets still in use, especially from other, poorer countries or rural carriers in this one who refuse to upgrade, likely because they can’t afford it. 2G will be with us a few more years, and 3G probably until the mid 2020’s at the earliest. Then again, with some of the fancy on-the-fly spectrum shuffling these new software-defined radio systems can do, it has been pointed out by others that, at least in an advanced network like TMo’s, they may NEVER go away completely! Nobody Special I predict after January 22nd @ The deadline for simple choice subscribers to switch to t-mobile one and get the tax included deal …. t-mobile will come up with a new incentive to trick the remaining simple choice subscribers to come to the darkside “T-Mobile One”…. the saga continues. nearvanaman I sort of rolled my eyes at T-Mo One because I typically use 1.5 to 3.0 gigs a month. But my 6GB plan, with taxes, costs me $75 a month. This “new” T-Mo One incentive will cost me a maximum of $70 and, sometimes, $60. I know the point is to get people on to the One plan and it’s hard to see a downside of doing this if they are never going to offer tiered plans again. Acdc1a For you it’s a no-brainer. I have 5 lines on ONE and Leger is right, it’s nice not to try to count GB. AJ2 What Tmo has failed to realize with the Tmo One plans is that most people still use 2gb or less. The $10 ‘back’ is a nice marekting ploy that I guess will make the plan a $60. If you use a Nexus or Pixel, Project Fi would still be cheaper. I see all these ads for $40 a line but thats only if you buy 4 lines. If they’d offer something for single customers, Id give Tmobile a try again as its the only one of the big 4 Ive ever had before switching to MVNOs. I dont care about a free Subway sandwich or some coupon to a product Idont want. If you can give a family of 4 free lines, you surely can do a promotion to offer single people a break Jay Holm If all people use is 2GB’s or less, what is the point in have a $500-$700+ smartphone? That’s like having a $20k car and driving lessons than 20 miles total per day, if I go no where but to work and back home that would be nearly 26 miles total in one day. I just don’t understand what the purpose is having a $500-$700 device and only use a measly 2gigs in a 30 day period. John Doe I don’t think Dish will end in 2017. They have Sling TV and Charlie Ergen isn’t a stupid guy so maybe I doubt it will disappear in 2017 that is too soon. I think John hopes that Dish will disappear so he can get his hands on their spectrum LoL (Oh that is right they have spectrum they can sell if things get bad for Dish) a d00d I don’t know if it was a mis-quote or not as I didn’t watch the video or whatever, but I think he meant Dish as a potential wireless competitor. The FCC has repeatedly warned them that they have never complied with their rules regarding build-out time after purchasing spectrum. That is, Dish is a Spectrum Squatter, the wireless version of a Domain Squatter, and, even under a new right-wing admin, I think the FCC may have finally had enough. Consider they let Globalstar use their little block of spectrum for limited terrestrial use after they’ve been begging for years. OTOH, Ergen has been squatting on a boat-load of spectrum with no network for years despite FCC pressure to sell or build. I for one truly hope that the FCC finally drops the hammer. QWR At CES, Legere actually said something to the effect that delivery of satellite-based content is dead, and so Dish will be dead as well. IMO he was not talking about Dish as a wireless provider. As far as the FCC goes, they have very little interest in going after Ergen for squatting since they turned him down for buying anyone on the cheap in 2015. He attempted to put it to use, and has until sometime this year to sell or lease 50% of his spectrum, even though it’s transmission properties are more suited for large amounts of data vs. speed. BadBatz 1. How about “predicting” some bonuses, freebies, incentives, etc. for long time subscribers to T-Mobile… The siren song of AT&T is calling… And Project Fi is taking already a lot of my business away from T-Mob… 2. Bandwidth… Need more bandwidth… How about more bandwidth… No more bandwidth, no more wireless watching of anything, Mr. Legere. And rural coverage… 3. Please, Mr. Legere, “predict” better international coverage for “free data roaming” and 20 cent voice calls. Some initiatives notwithstanding (Europe higher speed data for example) international roaming has become a sad joke: data throttled to the point of being unusable (64 kbps in may places), inability to dial out to many countries whilst roaming, etc. Even the T-Mobile app no workee in may places… Please “predict” improvements or just “predict” going back to the sate of int’l roaming from 2015… marque2 Project To always seemed really expensive to me. $10 per gig, wow. AJ2 Id switch to Tmobile if it had a less expensive plan for single customers, especially people that dont use 10-20 gb of data. Left Tmo years ago – First went to Straight Talk for their $45 5gb LTE plan and now on Fi where my bills are tiny. If Im not mistaken, with their new $10 rebate, the lowest plan is $60 if you use less than 2gb. Even getting paid $150 to switch doesnt make it worth it. Expert go with tmobile prepaid BadBatz If you don’t use gobs of data stay with Fi. For email, news, maps/navigation, etc. my total monthly bill is seldom over $30. Fi prefers T-Mobile anyway, even whilst roaming abroad the US endpoint is a T-Mobile IP in Texas, but connects to other networks stateside if T-Mobile is not available. Besides, laptop tethering doesn’t cost extra, roaming data is at full speed and it roams in some countries where T-Mobile does not. And Fi forwards calls AND text messages – the latter priceless if you use multiple phones. I have no idea what will become of Project Fi but for now I’m happy to have “Google talk” in my pocket :-) marque2 T-Mobile offered full speed tethering with its older plans. And I believe low speed tethering is included in Europe. Europe is way behind going to LTE, so high speed is also.lst impossible anyway. Jay Holm Since you use “so little data”, why even have a smartphone? Seriously! What a waste of money for someone who doesn’t even use their smartphone! marque2 Agreed, he can get a flip phone and 350 minutes of monthly service for $9 a month. Aleks I always knew that Google would enter the fray with a wireless service of their own. For John Legere to make this prediction, tells me that Google and T-Mobile could be looking at a merger, which to me, is the whole purpose of Google entering the wireless business sector. It’s been discussed behind closed doors. If this indeed does happen, look for wireless to be much cheaper and faster as Google is known to keep things affordable for the masses. Don’t take my word for it but if you’re on a legacy T-Mobile plan right now and ggrandfathered in, consider yourself lucky as they will be a major player in the wireless industry for the foreseeable future. I’m looking at Google and T-Mobile to work together and pave the way for the future. But like I said, don’t take my word for it. Just see it happening from a business standpoint. marque2 Google is evil. It will be a sad day when they take over TM. Nearmsp I would like to know what percentage of interstate freeways and state highways are covered rather than the million population. We just do not talk when we are in population centers. We talk while get from point A to point B and we could travel through places with no population on the way out of one city to another. This is the reason why people go for AT&T and Verizon. Coverage outside of major cities should be a goal of T-mobile. Currently I carry a a Verizon myfi and switch on as soon as leave the metro area to be able to do wi-fi calling. T-mobile coverage outside cities still sucks. It has improved much but a long way to go. KeepU You don’t happen to do much of that rural driving in West Virginia or between I-35 and I-5 do you? I drive a truck, and those are the only places I find a big difference in coverage between my t-mobile and verizon coverage. marque2 He doesn’t do much rural driving in his apparent state of Texas. Or never uses the phone while driving. Jay Holm I’ve driven from Houston to Laredo, from Houston to Dallas, from Houston to Longview. . .never lost signal in between any of these places. marque2 Try Midland to El Paso. No coverage for 200 miles when I last drove it. Try driving I-40 in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. I have a fairly new 5x as well. Parts of I15 in CA. Shouldn’t have problems with the new bands. And once the interstates are covered major highways should be next 395 and 78 “Ortega highway” comes to mind. I know TM is small and is trying hard to cover more, bit to claim no issues while travelling is false. Also note San Diego has major holes in Oceanside, Carlsbad, parts of Coronado and San Diego bay. They haven’t put Band 12 in San Diego yet. KeepU I predict the low grade billing fraud will continue, as will the network build out, and despite it’s serious flaws T-mobile will continue to be the least bad of the major wireless providers. QWR Nice hat. Did you get a free bowl of soup with it? And Dish would like to officially declare that you cut your hair this year. Steven Prediction, T-Mobile will continue to ignore the Alabama and Florida Gulf Coast by not issuing the much needed Extended Range LTE.

Real Madrid 2-0 Granada (Benzema) Live feed Show 8.51am EST 08:51 Full time: Real Madrid 5-0 Granada The referee calls a halt, and Real Madrid move six points ahead of Barcelona, who face a tricky trip to Villarreal tomorrow. This wasn’t quite the humiliation it threatened to be when Real went four goals up after 31 minutes, but was still entirely straightforward. Isco scored twice, while Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Casemiro added gloss to the final score. Their unbeaten run now extends to 39 games, and they will set a new Spanish record if they avoid defeat against Sevilla in their second-leg Cup tie next week. Sevilla will offer more of a test than they got today. Thanks for joining me. Adios. The Real Madrid players celebrate against Granada and the win puts them six points clear of Barcelona.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Google acquires Lime Audio to enhance voice quality on Hangouts The search engine giant, Google has announced the acquisition of Sweden’s Lime Audio company, in order to boost the voice quality on Hangouts. The Limes Audio team builds technology to enhance the voice communication systems sound for a better experience during video conferencing. In fact, Google acquired Swedish communications company Marratech, back in 2007 to support Google Talk and Hangouts. However, the company hasn’t revealed any financial details of the deal till now. Limes Audio was founded in 2007 by Fredric Lindström and Christian Schuldt with a workforce of just 20. In a blog post, Google said: As more and more businesses adopt our video conferencing solutions, powered by Chromebox for Meetings and Google Hangouts, it’s critical that we provide a great audio experience. With G Suite customers now relying on video communications for their day-to-day meetings, it’s more important than ever to ensure low-cost, high-quality audio. One of the biggest challenges to a great video meeting is the audio quality. Conference rooms today come in all shapes and sizes and that can provide a challenge for acoustics. Additionally, a poor internet connection can hamper voice quality in video conference calls. Limes Audio has been building solutions that remove the distracting noise, distortion and echoes that can affect online video and telephony meetings, improving the overall online conference experience. Fredric & Christian, Founders of Limes Audio, on their website, said: Since Limes Audio was founded in 2007, we have continuously pushed the limits of speech enhancement in our mission to provide the world’s best audio conferencing experience. Over the years, we have developed our technology and craftsmanship, and we are proud to find ourselves in a market leading position for many audio conferencing applications.

But most of these products, bogged down by glitchy software and hard-to-navigate interfaces, failed to go mainstream. This year may be different. Aided by new artificial intelligence software that makes it easier for gadgets to understand speech, tech giants led by Amazon.com Inc. are locked in a race for dominance of digital home assistants. "People are a bit disappointed with assistants, because there are no clear use cases," said Greg Gerard, creative chairman of Holi, which is debuting a $199 smart alarm clock called Bonjour. "We have one.” Gerard must show regular consumers the value of smart assistant technology. But he doesn't need to convince big technology firms, which all believe voice-based interactions with devices will explode in popularity. Almost every major tech company has or will soon introduce a digital assistant product powered by AI. And they're making a concerted effort to spread the technology everywhere. Alphabet Inc.'s Google is using CES to tout tie-ups with its smart Home speaker, a device similar to Amazon's Echo. Microsoft Corp. has invested heavily in its assistant, Cortana. Samsung Electronics Co. is set to unveil its assistant tech for its phones and other devices in 2017. Last month, Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg showed off a smart home assistant he said he coded himself.  Behind the scenes at CES, these tech behemoths will fight to get their voice-based systems into televisions, cable boxes and every home appliance, not just smartphones and PCs. Analysts expect several dozen announcements around voice-systems at this week's event in Las Vegas, including new functions for internet-connected devices and cars. Ford Motor Co. unveiled an integration with Alexa on Wednesday.  Then there are the specialized assistants, ranging from the Bonjour clock, which Gerard said will arrive later this year, to a personal home robot from startup Jibo -- a compact, futuristic device designed to recognize human emotions, said company Chief Executive Officer Steve Chambers. Research firm Tractica estimates about 40 million homes will use a voice-activated digital assistant by 2021.  Amazon's version, Alexa, introduced in 2014 on the Echo speaker, works with more than 6,000 applications, according to a company spokeswoman. On Tuesday, Amazon announced a partnership with Whirlpool Corp., adding voice command capabilities to Whirlpool washers, dryers, ovens and refrigerators.  Amazon has built an effective developer outreach strategy and introduced a $100 million investment fund for startups creating products around voice applications. Unlike other tech peers, Amazon has a dominant sales channel for its voice-assistance partners. "Amazon has been brilliant about it," said Mark Beccue, an analyst at Tractica. "They might be the best trigger to the smart home, to making it a mass-market product."  GOOGLE MAKES ITS SPLASH Last year, Biz Stone revamped his startup, Jelly Industries Inc., as a search engine—something that puts it up against Google. But when Google began hunting partners last month for its Home speaker, Jelly was among the first to sign on. Google was a zealous suitor. Employees treated him to lunch and when the deal closed a Google operative sent him an animated gif of Seinfeld characters dancing. "They've been a joy to work with," said Stone, who co-founded Twitter Inc.  Google's aggressive courtship is understandable; it's behind Amazon. Since inception, Google's business was based on keyboard-based searches. Now the web giant is refocusing its strategy around its voice assistant, a system that sits in its speaker, Pixel smartphone and—if Google succeeds— every device imaginable. On Tuesday at CES, Google announced a partnership with Hyundai Motor Co. that lets drivers control some car functions by talking to the Home speaker. It's expected to unveil more assistant partnerships with devices like smart TVs. Google has an edge in building voice technology, thanks to its unmatched repository of search data. But the company must prove it can distribute its assistant widely. Hurdles exist. The same month Google debuted its Pixel phone, Samsung, the largest Android phone manufacturer, acquired Viv Labs, a startup building a voice-powered assistant. Samsung plans to roll out an AI platform for its devices this year, the company said in a statement. Apple Inc., which tightly controls about 40 percent of U.S. smartphones, is investing in a similar push with its Siri voice assistant.  Microsoft already has software tools for developers to embed Cortana into devices, and its automotive partners will announce new integrations at CES, said Matthew Quinlan, Cortana's director of product marketing. "For Cortana to do her job, she needs to be in a lot of different devices." And there's Facebook. The company has said that Zuckerberg's smart-home tech was merely a demonstration. Yet the social network is testing more bot integrations with the AI-assistant in its popular Messenger chat app, a product Google has struggled to deliver. Still, Amazon remains the one to catch. For developers building voice-assisted tools, the company offers support from its already popular cloud-computing platform, giving it another edge. "You are not going to see a clear no. 2 emerge in 2017," said Forrester analyst Mike Gualtieri. "Technologically, Google is the closest competitor. But in terms of Google's ability to get it into homes, I question that." ASSISTANT NIGHTMARE Another question is how to make money from a voice-controlled home. Profit margins on hardware sales are usually thin and voice-controlled computers may throw a wrench in established business models, like text-based web search.   Some investors backing the technology aren't concerned. "There are lots and lots of ways you can monetize when you control the interface," said John Lilly, a venture capitalist with Greylock Partners. "You control control information flow. You can route requests. You can certainly ship people stuff."  Lilly, who backs AI assistant startup Ozlo, insists young companies can make dents in the market with more advanced technology, like systems that can carry on complex conversations, rather than the relatively simple commands Alexa uses. However, analysts are skeptical that startups can match the budgets and data reserves of public tech companies.  Still, that may not dissuade companies, large and small, from trying to build their own voice assistants. With that rush, the question of who controls the tools will become paramount. "In less than three years, every home will have the opportunity to have this digital assistant," said Forrester's Gualtieri. "Now you’ll have the question of who am I talking to: Amazon Echo or my refrigerator? So that could be a nightmare." Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

"Today's doodle reflects Fleming's legacy on this, the 190th anniversary of his birth," Google said in a statement on Saturday. It is widely believed that Sandford Fleming missing a train in Ireland due to a mistake printed in a timetable ultimately led to his brilliant idea that altered time as we know it. Sandford Fleming was born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, in 1827. This was a period when regions used solar time to set their own clocks. Solar time worked well enough until trains came along and the need for standardised time arose. Following his missed train in 1876, Sandford Fleming proposed a worldwide standard time at a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on February, 8, 1879. Sandford Fleming advocated for dividing the world into 24 time zones beginning at the Greenwich Meridian and spaced at 15 degree intervals. His proposal gave way to the International Prime Meridian Conference which convened in 1884 and was attended by 25 nations. It was here that Sandford Fleming's system of international standard time was adopted. Sandford Fleming was also known for helping build the Intercontinental Railway, serving as chief engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and designing Canada's first postage stamp.

LONDON — David Wynter knows the risks cyclists face on the roads as well as anyone. The first time he was hit by a vehicle was in May 2014 in East London, by a van making a U-turn without checking its mirrors. “Took me five weeks to fully recover,” he said. The second time was a little over a year later. Wynter, who is CEO of London data management startup Yambina, collided with a woman turning right into his lane. “Sprained my left wrist, needed a brace on it, a few cuts and deep bruises including my cheek where my cycling glasses cut into it.” Most people who cycle regularly in cities have a story (or two) like this — or at least know someone who does. The increased popularity of cycling, heightened driver awareness, and bike lane initiatives are helping to improve hazardous conditions. However, it doesn’t get around the fact that many urban areas are just hopelessly designed for cyclists and drivers to share the road. But some cyclists, technologists, and automobile manufacturers are starting to eagerly look at a surprising solution: Self-driving cars. Some cyclists think a golden age is right around the corner Self-driving cars, long a dream, are finally becoming a reality. Everyone from Google to Audi, from Uber to Volkswagen, are heavily investing in and developing the technology. The goal is to create totally autonomous vehicles, capable of driving in real-world conditions without any human input. Right now, 94% of all car accidents in the US are due to human error, according to Google. Roads are dangerous, and doubly so for cyclists, who don’t have metal casing to protect them. But self-driving tech — in theory — has significant advantages over any human driver. It won’t tire. It won’t get bored. It won’t be tempted to break the rules of the road. It will be able to look in every direction simultaneously. And crucially, it will have super-human reaction speeds. Together, it all adds up to potential massive improvement in safety — the kind that historically hadn’t been possible without major urban redevelopment. By some estimates, self-driving cars could save 300,000 lives a decade in the United States alone. Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesA cyclist passes an early Google self-driving car in 2012 Dr. Miklós Kiss, head of predevelopment piloted systems at Audi, thinks self-driving cars could be a boon to cyclists. It will “make it easier for cyclists because the behaviour of automated cars will be more predictable than now,” he told Business Insider. Many cyclists are equally enthusiastic. “If self-driving cars are proven safer for cyclists and pedestrians, cyclists would lay out the red carpet and welcome the revolution with both arms,” Andreas Kambanis, founder of biking site LondonCyclist.co.uk, told Business Insider. Alex Livesey/Getty ImagesHere we go, here we go, here we go. “Just under 50% of cyclist deaths on London’s roads are caused by HGVs, so if the technology extended there, we’d immediately eliminate a huge danger.” He added: “Beyond the safety aspect, self driving cars may also be more of a pleasure to drive around, as you wouldn’t expect it to do something erratic or to drive aggressively. This may in turn mean more cyclists on the road as the roads will now feel safer.” Eli Allalouf, a director at Alyo International, used to bike everywhere, he said. “But after my second bicycle were stolen and too many injuries cycling on the road I have given up … I would love to have the ability to ride my bicycle every day to work but the risk is too high as I am a family man with kids and wife … After a certain period of the fully automated cars I think there will be a huge spike in cycling.” Accounting for cyclists isn’t easy, say self-driving car companies However, engineers working on the technology say that learning to deal with cyclists is throwing up unique challenges. They’re small, fast in urban environments, and nimble — but also relatively slow on open roads, and immensely vulnerable. “Cyclists are more dynamic than cars. The biggest challenge is to predict their future behaviour and driving route. Cyclists can be found on the road and on footpaths too. Compared to cars they are not limited to only one road space. Sometimes cyclists do not obey traffic rules completely (red light-violators, etc.),” Audi’s Dr. Miklós Kiss said. “Cyclists need their own behaviour prediction model as they behave differently to car drivers and pedestrians.” Karl Iagnemma, CEO of autonomous tech startup Nutonomy, has encountered similar problems. “All autonomous vehicles under development today are being designed to detect and avoid cyclists. This requires that the sensing systems be specifically ‘trained’ to detect cyclists, and that the navigation systems be instructed how to manoeuvre in the presence of cyclists.” Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn takes a particularly dim view, telling CNBC in January 2016 that “one of the biggest problems [for self-driving cars] is people with bicycles.” GoogleGoogle’s software can detect cyclists’ hand signals and use them to figure out what the cyclist is planning to do next. “They don’t respect any rules usually,” he claimed. “The car is confused by them, because from time-to-time they behave like pedestrians and from time-to-time they behave like cars.” Google, one of the most high-profile developers of the tech, isn’t trash-talking cyclists — but recognises the difficulties they can pose. In its June 2016 progress report, Google’s self-driving car team explained how its vehicles treat cyclists differently (and “conservatively”) to other road users. “For example, when our sensors detect a parallel-parked car with an open door near a cyclist, our car is programmed to slow down or nudge over to give the rider enough space to move towards the center of the lane and avoid the door,” the Google team wrote. “We also aim to give cyclists ample buffer room when we pass, and our cars won’t squeeze by when cyclists take the center of the lane, even if there’s technically enough space. Whether the road is too narrow or they’re making a turn, we respect this indication that cyclists want to claim their lane.” And because cyclists don’t have indicator lights, the technology has to predict cyclists’ intentions another way: By reading their hand gestures using its in-built cameras. Jeff Swensen/Getty ImagesAn Uber driverless Ford Fusion drives down Smallman Street on September, 22, 2016 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Uber’s self-driving car trials in December 2016 clearly illustrated the dangers the tech can pose to cyclists if not properly implemented. Its vehicles were performing a “right hook” turn that put cyclists at serious risk — with the San Francisco Bike Coalition calling it “one of the primary causes of collisions between cars and people who bike resulting in serious injury or fatality.” Uber opted to keep its vehicles in circulation, to the alarm of cycling advocates, and had human drivers make the turn manually instead. Thankfully there were no reported injuries, and the trial was subsequently ended after the California DMV revoked the registrations of the vehicles because they didn’t have a licence for the tests. Self-driving cars aren’t a reason to stop supporting cyclists Peter Macdiarmid/Getty ImagesCyclists stage a ‘die-in’ protest in London to raise awareness of road safety. These technological challenges — while tricky — are all theoretically surmountable. Companies like Renault-Nissan say they want autonomous vehicles in commercial production by 2020. With over 50,000 cyclists injured in road accidents in America in 2014 (and another 21,000 in the UK), that date can’t come quickly enough. “There will a point where the number of accidents involving cars and cyclists will improve,” David Wynter said. “Only then will the public feel it is safer to commute in the cities.” However, Andreas Kambanis, from LondonCyclist.co.uk, cautions that self-driving vehicles will not be a panacea for everything currently wrong with cycling in cities — and must not be used as an excuse to slack on supporting cyclists in other ways.. “There is one big caveat to all of this. London’s roads are already heavily congested and polluted, more cars isn’t going to solve this problem, so the city must continue to invest in infrastructure that considers cyclists.” NOW WATCH: 5 hidden features only PlayStation 4 power users know about Follow Business Insider Australia on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn Tagged In audi cycling google nutonomy self-driving cars uk Discuss Be the first to comment on this story!

Why the Yahoo hacker might not be interested in short-term profit Even if you only downloaded a handful of apps last year, do you remember what permissions you granted to each?  CBC's Marketplace recently tested how much personal information we can unknowingly hand over to apps. The start of new year is a time to reset —  and the perfect time to unlearn all of the bad privacy habits you may have picked up. Here are a few tips to get you started. Review your privacy settings Both Android and iPhone have a settings page where you can see which apps have access to everything from your heart rate to your home's lighting system. It's here that you can review which apps have access to what, and disable permissions you don't remember granting. Watch the Marketplace investigation Are Your Apps Spying On You? CBC AT CES | For new smart-home gadgets, the spectre of insecurity looms Apple even offers an option to reset all of your phone's privacy and security settings at once, so that the next time you open an app that needs access to your microphone, camera, or other data, it will ask for your permission as if you were just using the app for the first time. In terms of what apps can do, there are some differences between Android phones and iPhones to keep in mind. Apple, for example, doesn't allow developers to access the camera unless an app is open and in use, nor access iMessages or SMS messages. Stick to app stores Apple and Google maintain app stores where most people buy their apps. It's a way for the two companies to control what people can do on their platforms — for better and for worse. One benefit is that, as part of the app store review process, Apple and Google vet apps for potential security or privacy issues — essentially, screening out apps that would otherwise be classified as malware, or try to access user data in a way that violates their terms of service. Find out more about the Marketplace investigation this weekend, when CBC's Diana Swain explores the ethics of the app experiment on The Investigators Saturday at 9:30 p.m. ET and Sunday at 5:30 p.m. ET on CBC News Network. While you can disable the security settings on Android and iPhone that prevent you from downloading apps from other sources, you probably shouldn't unless you really know what you're doing. There's no one watching to make sure that app you got from a friend is really doing what it says it does. Do Google and Apple know where you've been? Both Android and iPhone provide a number of ways for apps to access your location — which you can check in your phone's privacy settings. But both Apple and Google also have their own location-tracking settings that are separate from third-party apps. CBC AT CES | Why everyone's talking to Amazon's virtual assistant Alexa On iPhones running iOS 7 and higher, there are a number of location-based tracking options under the "System Services" section of your phone's location privacy settings (pay close attention to the "Frequent Locations" setting in particular). On Android version 2.3 and up, you'll find "Google Location History" under your phone's "Location" settings. Apple and Google use your phone's location so their apps better understand the places you frequently visit, and for advertising purposes, but you can turn this off. Get yourself a password manager Writing down your passwords on a scrap of paper that you keep in your sock drawer is never a good idea. But storing all your passwords in a password manager is smart. Think of it is a digital vault, secured with one really long passphrase, that holds all your other passwords inside. Instead of having to remember a bunch of short, insecure passwords, you only have to remember a really long one instead. A good password manager won't just store your passwords, but will help you generate stronger, more secure passwords, too. Protect yourself with 2-factor authentication The best thing you can do to stop attackers from getting into your accounts with Facebook, Google, Twitter, Dropbox, and other services is to setup two-factor authentication. Each time you attempt to log in to an account protected by two-factor authentication from a new phone or computer, you'll be asked for the password you know, but also an additional, temporary password that you don't (that's the second factor). Why passthoughts could make passwords a thing of the past The idea is that this temporary password is generated by an app on your phone, or sent via text message — meaning that even if someone learns your password, they'll still need access to your phone to get into your account. Want to know what data your apps have collected? Ask! In Canada, there's legislation called the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), which "gives people a general right to access their personal information held by businesses subject to this law." In other words, if you want a record of all the information that your favourite emoji keyboard, banking app, or social network has stored about you, can send the company a letter and ask. The process might take a while — and there's no guarantee you'll get a response back, even if it is Canadian law — but it's a great way to exercise your right to privacy and learn just how much of your personal data is under a company's control.

 Self-driving cars could spark a cycling revolution Rob Price Jan. 7, 2017, 4:36 AM 7,237 facebook linkedin twitter email print The future's bright, cyclists say. Charlie Crowhurst/Getty Images for Challenge Triathlon LONDON — David Wynter knows the risks cyclists face on the roads as well as anyone. The first time he was hit by a vehicle was in May 2014 in East London, by a van making a U-turn without checking its mirrors. "Took me five weeks to fully recover," he said. The second time was a little over a year later. Wynter, who is CEO of London data management startup Yambina, collided with a woman turning right into his lane. "Sprained my left wrist, needed a brace on it, a few cuts and deep bruises including my cheek where my cycling glasses cut into it." Most people who cycle regularly in cities have a story (or two) like this — or at least know someone who does. The increased popularity of cycling, heightened driver awareness, and bike lane initiatives are helping to improve hazardous conditions. However, it doesn't get around the fact that many urban areas are just hopelessly designed for cyclists and drivers to share the road. But some cyclists, technologists, and automobile manufacturers are starting to eagerly look at a surprising solution: Self-driving cars. Some cyclists think a golden age is right around the corner Self-driving cars, long a dream, are finally becoming a reality. Everyone from Google to Audi, from Uber to Volkswagen, are heavily investing in and developing the technology. The goal is to create totally autonomous vehicles, capable of driving in real-world conditions without any human input. Right now, 94% of all car accidents in the US are due to human error, according to Google. Roads are dangerous, and doubly so for cyclists, who don't have metal casing to protect them. But self-driving tech — in theory — has significant advantages over any human driver. It won't tire. It won't get bored. It won't be tempted to break the rules of the road. It will be able to look in every direction simultaneously. And crucially, it will have super-human reaction speeds. Together, it all adds up to potential massive improvement in safety — the kind that historically hadn't been possible without major urban redevelopment. By some estimates, self-driving cars could save 300,000 lives a decade in the United States alone. A cyclist passes an early Google self-driving car in 2012 Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Dr. Miklós Kiss, head of predevelopment piloted systems at Audi, thinks self-driving cars could be a boon to cyclists. It will "make it easier for cyclists because the behavior of automated cars will be more predictable than now," he told Business Insider. Many cyclists are equally enthusiastic. "If self-driving cars are proven safer for cyclists and pedestrians, cyclists would lay out the red carpet and welcome the revolution with both arms," Andreas Kambanis, founder of biking site LondonCyclist.co.uk, said. Here we go, here we go, here we go. Alex Livesey/Getty Images "Just under 50% of cyclist deaths on London's roads are caused by HGVs, so if the technology extended there, we'd immediately eliminate a huge danger." He added: "Beyond the safety aspect, self driving cars may also be more of a pleasure to drive around, as you wouldn't expect it to do something erratic or to drive aggressively. This may in turn mean more cyclists on the road as the roads will now feel safer." Eli Allalouf, a director at Alyo International, used to bike everywhere, he said. "But after my second bicycle were stolen and too many injuries cycling on the road I have given up ... I would love to have the ability to ride my bicycle every day to work but the risk is too high as I am a family man with kids and wife ... After a certain period of the fully automated cars I think there will be a huge spike in cycling." Accounting for cyclists isn't easy, say self-driving car companies However, engineers working on the technology say that learning to deal with cyclists is throwing up unique challenges. They're small, fast in urban environments, and nimble — but also relatively slow on open roads, and immensely vulnerable. "Cyclists are more dynamic than cars. The biggest challenge is to predict their future behavior and driving route. Cyclists can be found on the road and on sidewalks too. Compared to cars they are not limited to only one road space. Sometimes cyclists do not obey traffic rules completely (red light-violators, etc.)," Audi's Dr. Miklós Kiss said. "Cyclists need their own behavior prediction model as they behave differently to car drivers and pedestrians." Karl Iagnemma, CEO of autonomous tech startup Nutonomy, has encountered similar problems. "All autonomous vehicles under development today are being designed to detect and avoid cyclists. This requires that the sensing systems be specifically 'trained' to detect cyclists, and that the navigation systems be instructed how to maneuver in the presence of cyclists." Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn takes a particularly dim view, telling CNBC in January 2016 that "one of the biggest problems [for self-driving cars] is people with bicycles." Google's software can detect cyclists' hand signals and use them to figure out what the cyclist is planning to do next. Google "They don't respect any rules usually," he claimed. "The car is confused by them, because from time-to-time they behave like pedestrians and from time-to-time they behave like cars." Google, one of the most high-profile developers of the tech, isn't trash-talking cyclists — but recognises the difficulties they can pose. In its June 2016 progress report, Google's self-driving car team explained how its vehicles treat cyclists differently (and "conservatively") to other road users. "For example, when our sensors detect a parallel-parked car with an open door near a cyclist, our car is programmed to slow down or nudge over to give the rider enough space to move towards the center of the lane and avoid the door," the Google team wrote. "We also aim to give cyclists ample buffer room when we pass, and our cars won’t squeeze by when cyclists take the center of the lane, even if there’s technically enough space. Whether the road is too narrow or they’re making a turn, we respect this indication that cyclists want to claim their lane." And because cyclists don't have indicator lights, the technology has to predict cyclists' intentions another way: By reading their hand gestures using its in-built cameras. An Uber driverless Ford Fusion drives down Smallman Street on September, 22, 2016 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images Uber's self-driving car trials in December 2016 clearly illustrated the dangers the tech can pose to cyclists if not properly implemented. Its vehicles were performing a "right hook" turn that put cyclists at serious risk — with the San Francisco Bike Coalition calling it "one of the primary causes of collisions between cars and people who bike resulting in serious injury or fatality." Uber opted to keep its vehicles in circulation, to the alarm of cycling advocates, and had human drivers make the turn manually instead. Thankfully there were no reported injuries, and the trial was subsequently ended after the California DMV revoked the registrations of the vehicles because they didn't have a license for the tests. Self-driving cars aren't a reason to stop supporting cyclists Cyclists stage a "die-in" protest in London to raise awareness of road safety. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images These technological challenges — while tricky — are all theoretically surmountable. Companies like Renault-Nissan say they want autonomous vehicles in commercial production by 2020. With over 50,000 cyclists injured in road accidents in America in 2014 (and another 21,000 in the UK), that date can't come quickly enough. "There will a point where the number of accidents involving cars and cyclists will improve," David Wynter said. "Only then will the public feel it is safer to commute in the cities." However, Andreas Kambanis, from LondonCyclist.co.uk, cautions that self-driving vehicles will not be a panacea for everything currently wrong with cycling in cities — and must not be used as an excuse to slack on supporting cyclists in other ways.. "There is one big caveat to all of this. London's roads are already heavily congested and polluted, more cars isn't going to solve this problem, so the city must continue to invest in infrastructure that considers cyclists."

Social efforts in all shapes and forms, including messengers and the infamous Google+ have always been a weakpoint in the chain and the current situation isn't really that much better. Allo and Duo seem to be center-stage in the IM package Google is currently trying to push to end users. Thus, Hangouts' fate is still quite uncertain and while Google is sticking to its promise not to retire it, it is now clear that a major course readjustment is already underway. As part of that, the platform's API, or at least the part used by many third-party developers will be going down on April 25. Apparently, Google intends to use Hangouts as a specialized tool for meetings and market it for enterprise use. At the Google Horizon event in September 2016, we previewed a new experience for Hangouts focused on meetings. In order to streamline our efforts further, we will be retiring the Google+ Hangouts API that enables developers to build apps for the older version of Hangouts video calls. This API was originally intended to support social scenarios for consumer users as part of Google+, whereas Hangouts is now turning to focus on enterprise use cases. However, not all third-party solutions are getting axed. For example, the DialPad and RingCentral apps, which are used to dial into a Hangouts session from a phone will remain functional. Naturally, Google's own Toolbox, Control Room and Cameraman, intended for Hangouts on Air broadcasting will be fine too. Interestingly enough, the popular Slack enterprise communication tool will be spared as well. It is also worth noting, that if Google keeps the Hangouts web interfaces alive in any convenient form, various web-based tools, like the Franz IM aggregator should also slip through the cracks.

It is widely believed that Fleming missing a train in Ireland due to a mistake printed in a timetable ultimately led to his brilliant idea that altered time as we know it. Fleming was born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, in 1827. This was a period when regions used solar time to set their own clocks. Solar time worked well enough until trains came along and the need for standardised time arose. Following his missed train in 1876, Fleming proposed a worldwide standard time at a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on February, 8, 1879. He advocated for dividing the world into 24 time zones beginning at the Greenwich Meridian and spaced at 15 degree intervals. His proposal gave way to the International Prime Meridian Conference which convened in 1884 and was attended by 25 nations. It was here that Fleming’s system of international standard time was adopted. Fleming was also known for helping build the Intercontinental Railway, serving as chief engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and designing Canada’s first postage stamp.

Google Hangouts API gets hung out to dry Posted Jan 6, 2017 by Josh Constine (@joshconstine) 0 SHARES Next Story A view from Andreessen Horowitz on the questions shaping the future of autonomous vehicles Draw with your face? Conference call ping pong? Not any more. Google today quietly revealed that it will shut down the Hangouts API, preventing new apps from being built and shutting off existing apps on April 25th. There was no blog post about this, just an updated FAQ and email notification to developers active on the API, forwarded to us by one of these devs. Some examples of experiences that could be built on the API include augmented reality selfie masks, polling and collaborative drawing, like the Scoot & Doodle app. But as Google pushes Duo as its consumer video chat app and relegates Hangouts to the enterprise, it’s dropping the flexibility to build these kinds of experiences. The email explains that: “In order to streamline our efforts further, we will be retiring the Google+ Hangouts API that enables developers to build apps for the older version of Hangouts video calls. This API was originally intended to support social scenarios for consumer users as part of Google+, whereas Hangouts is now turning to focus on enterprise use cases. We understand this will impact developers who have invested in our platform. We have carefully considered this change and believe that it allows us to give our users a more targeted Hangouts desktop video experience going forward.” According to the FAQ, the few exceptions that will still run are the ability to dial into a Hangout via DialPad and RingCentral, integrations with enterprise chat tools like Slack and Hangouts on Air tools like Toolbox, Control Room and Cameraman. [Correction: Toolbox was made by an independent developer, not Google.] The Google Hangouts API is a casualty of Google’s fragmented messaging app strategy and the neglect of Hangouts itself. It was one of the first full-featured video chat apps, and it pioneered the AR selfie mask space that Snapchat has now turned into a teenage phenomenon. But by launching multiple siloed messaging apps that don’t talk to each other and forcing the Google+ social layer onto Hangouts, the service fell out of favor. Now with the API shut down, it’s one-step closer to being just a video version of the traditional business call. That might be more “streamline,” but it’s far from inspiring users to take a second look at Hangouts. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Hangouts Description Hangouts bring your conversations to life with photos, emoji, and even group video calls for free.

Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp to Ford Motor Co unveiled products featuring Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon that responds to voice commands. Most strikingly, Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co, which manufactures smartphones running on the Android operating system produced by Alphabet Inc's Google, announced that its flagship handset will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States. The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said. Many in the technology industry believe that such voice-powered digital assistants will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way consumers interact with devices. While the shift is only in the early stages, Google must establish a strong presence quickly, particularly on Android devices, to maintain its dominance in internet search, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue,” he said. Alexa debuted on the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and Amazon is establishing a broad array of hardware and software partnerships around it. The competing Google Assistant launched last year on the company’s Pixel smartphone, after appearing on Google's messaging app, and has begun to roll out to third-party devices as well. Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp announced at CES that its Shield television will feature the assistant. While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said. “It highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services,” he said. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. While Amazon has a head start, Google is no by no means out of the race, given the strength of its internet search technology. The Google Assistant can already field queries that Alexa cannot, said Sergei Burkov, chief executive of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company. “A huge part of an assistant is search,” he said. “Google is a search company. Amazon is not.” SEARCH More from Sify: gold rate silver rate   Cities   Price (10g)   Gold Rate in Chennai   Rs. 26820.00 (0%)   Gold Rate in Mumbai   Rs. 27170.00 (0.93%)   Gold Rate in Delhi   Rs. 26900.00 (0%)   Gold Rate in Kolkata   Rs. 26290.00 (0%)   Gold Rate in Kerala   Rs. 25850.00 (0%)   Gold Rate in Bangalore   Rs. 26250.00 (0.57%)   Gold Rate in Hyderabad   Rs. 26920.00 (0.37%) more   Cities   Price (1 kg)   Silver Rate in Chennai   Rs. 39345.00 (-0.01%)   Silver Rate in Mumbai   Rs. 39345.00 (-0.01%)   Silver Rate in Delhi   Rs. 39345.00 (-0.01%)   Silver Rate in Kolkata   Rs. 39345.00 (-0.01%)   Silver Rate in Kerala   Rs. 39345.00 (-0.01%) more talking point on sify finance About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

Now you can connect Google Fit and Apple Health to your fitness goals in Google Calendar. When you do, activity in your favorite fitness apps will be recorded and used to mark your goals in Google Calendar as “done” automatically. You can see how you’re doing with the new visual performance tracker. With this, future goal times will be even more tailored based on when you’re most likely to complete them. “Say you set a goal to run at 6:30 every other morning but aren’t actually hitting your stride until 7:15 — Google Calendar has you covered and will adjust accordingly,” said Google. The Google Fit and Apple Health integration for Calendar app is already available for iOS and is gradually rolling out for Android. If you can’t wait, you can grab the Google Calendar 5.7 APK here.

If that’s your goal of 2017 as well, then maybe keeping track of those goals might be a good idea, and the good news is that the folks at Google want to help you do that by integrating your fitness tracking goals into Google Calendar. According to Google, “Starting today, you can connect Google Fit and Apple Health to your fitness goals in Google Calendar. When you do, activity in your favorite fitness apps will be recorded and used to mark your goals in Google Calendar as “done” automatically.” This means that both iOS and Android users who have the Google Calendar app will be able to take advantage of this new feature. Google also makes adjustments because they know that sometimes you run a little late. “Say you set a goal to run at 6:30 every other morning but aren’t actually hitting your stride until 7:15 — Google Calendar has you covered and will adjust accordingly.” So this means even if you don’t start on time, not to worry as you won’t feel like you missed your goal for the day. Of course at the end of the day whether or not you successfully achieve your goals comes down to self-discipline and your willpower, but hey, nobody said you couldn’t get a little hi-tech help along the way, right?

Google has revealed the top 10 travel questions most frequently asked by American users. Coming top of the list, the geographical location of Bali – a Hindu island found between the islands of Java and Lombok in the Indonesian archipelago – appears to have piqued the interest of web users in the United States. In fourth place, “Where is Corfu” proved another popular question for American travellers last year. A trendy European destination in 2016, the Greek island is located in the Ionian Sea, unlike other well-known island hotspots like Santorini. Pontikonisi in Corfu, Greece. Where is Corfu was the fourth most-asked question on Google last year. Photo: AFP The location of Bora Bora, in French Polynesia (sixth), and the Grand Canyon (10th) complete the list of geography-based travel questions. Other questions in the top 10 focus on activities within the United States.

Home Industry Technology Google Doodle pays tribute to Sir Sandford Fleming: Here is why he invented worldwide standard time zones Google Doodle pays tribute to Sir Sandford Fleming: Here is why he invented worldwide standard time zones Google celebrated Sir Sandford Fleming's 190th birth anniversary on Saturday dedicating the Google doodle art to the inventor if the standard time zones. By: FE Online | Published: January 7, 2017 11:24 AM Before Sir Sandford Fleming had come around with the idea for a standardised time zone, different regions had been mainly dependent on the solar time. Google celebrated Sir Sandford Fleming’s 190th birth anniversary on Saturday dedicating the Google doodle art to the inventor if the standard time zones. Fleming was a Scottish-born Canadian inventor and engineer and was the first known person to propose the standard time in 1879. In 1884, Fleming’s idea had been adapted by 25 countries. Before Fleming had come around with the idea for a standardised time zone, different regions had been mainly dependent on the solar time. It is widely said that Fleming came up with the idea after he had missed a train in Ireland due to conflicting time zones affecting the scheduling of the trains. Fleming had first presented the idea of a standard time on February 8, 1879, at the Royal Canadian Institute. The introduction of four time zones began on November 18, 1883. The exact time was majorly decided y another new technology that had taken the industrial revolution by storm-the telegraph. In 1884, following Fleming’s proposal, the ITC established a plan for the different time zones, including the International Date Line. And thus began two of the biggest inventions of the Industrial revolution- wristwatches and standard time. With the new idea, that would eventually set the world into a definitive motion, Fleming spoke about diving the time into 24 time zones starting at the Greenwich Meridian, spaced at 15 degree intervals. The proposal was formally adopted at the International Prime Meridian Conference, 1884 where 25 countries agreed to it. Before Fleming, solar time was widely used until the times, the railways became a normal feature in the world raising the need for a standardised time, The introduction of synchronised clocks was also known to help in weather forecasting. After Fleming’s proposal in 1884 at the IPMC, the Greenwich Mean Time was introduced cord Britain in 1847. Also in News: Fleming was born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland and became an apprentice surveyor at the age of 14, following which he travelled to Canada in 1845 with his brother at the age of 18. It was there that he founded the RCI in 1849, which later became a renowned centre completely dedicated to the advancement of science. Fleming, following his stint in Canada where he invented the Standardised Time Zones, was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1897. He died at the age of 88 at his daughter’s home in Halifax on July 22, 1915. Please Wait while comments are loading...

At the moment, the only option is to turn on notifications for Google’s homepage doodles, but nevertheless is quite notable for how high-level it is. On the majority of Android devices, the Notifications page is now the very first item at the top of Settings, ranking over Search and Home screen. Meanwhile, the setting is listed under Google Assistant on the Pixel. A toggle to turn on notifications for “New Doodle games, videos, and interactive experiences” is currently the only setting. By default, it set to off and requires enabling on each device. With doodles often marking both major events and others that are less well known, Google might have a way to highlight important things that would otherwise miss people’s attentions. Despite the high level status of the new pane, notifications for Feed — previously Google Now — cards still remain in the “Your feed” page. This inconsistency could be confusing for new users as the Feed frequently sends notifications for drastic temperature and weather changes, sport scores, major news alerts, and more that direct users back to the Google app. The new Notification settings page is currently being rolled out server-side to recent versions of the Google app. It does not appear to be limited to the current beta version (6.10).

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > T-Mobile CEO John Legere makes his predictions for 2017 T-Mobile CEO John Legere makes his predictions for 2017 January 6, 2017 Alex Wagner 40 Comments It’s the start of a new year, and just like he has the past couple of years, T-Mobile CEO John Legere has laid out his predictions for the coming 12 months. Legere’s first prediction for 2017 is that cable companies will try to enter wireless through MVNO deals, but that they’ll fail. Legere adds that because of this, T-Mobile will not get into any MVNO deals with cable companies. Cable companies are the only ones that’ll try to get into wireless in 2017, Legere suggests, as he thinks that “a MAJOR new player will jump in and shake up US wireless in a MAJOR way.” The T-Mo CEO specifically guesses that Google will “go for the mobile moonshot.” Google offers wireless service through Project Fi, which runs on the T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular networks, but Legere appears to think that Google will take things a step farther in 2017. Sticking with the topic of other companies, Legere thinks that Dish will be no more this year after it missed its opportunity to enter wireless using its supply of spectrum. Moving on to television shows, Legere predicts that the majority of TV watching will happen on mobile by the end of 2017. More than one-third of TV viewing happens on something other than a TV, Legere says, with that number jumping to 50 percent for people under 25. And T-Mo’s CEO expects those numbers to continue to grow. The second TV-related prediction from Legere is that content built for OTT and mobile consumption, like his Slow Cooker Sunday show, will pass cable channels in number of viewers. Specifically, Legere thinks that his Slow Cooker Sunday show will get a weekly audience of 1 million viewers by the end of 2017. The show currently pulls in more than 500,000 viewers each week. Rounding out John’s 2017 predictions are gigabit LTE speeds, which T-Mobile touts that it’s nearly achieved in lab testing; a wireless CEO shuffle that’ll see three of the four current CEOs exiting their positions this year; and merger discussions between Verizon and Comcast as a way to help Comcast get into wireless. While John didn’t make any specific predictions about T-Mobile’s network, it seems likely that T-Mo will continue to build out its LTE coverage in 2017. T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray said yesterday that T-Mo plans to cover 320 million POPs with LTE in 2017, up from the 313 million covered at the end of 2016. Ray also said that T-Mobile currently reaches 251 million people with its Extended Range LTE coverage and that that number will grow in the first half of 2017. So what do you think of all these predictions? Do you have any that you’d like to add?

The prospect of that being the year end coverage map is so very exciting! Mark Kendrick I’m amazed myself by the improvement in their network in just the last year. I tried TMO last year for a couple of months but bailed because the service wasn’t very good, a year later and I’m quite satisfied Edward Ward Over the past year I have seen my coverage improve tremendously, to the point where I now have coverage on par with my wife who is Verizon loyal. Jason Caprio Those are some nice coverage predictions. I’ll believe it when I see it. I hope to see the day when T-Mobile ties/beats Verizon in rootmetrics, then I’ll switch back! I’m rooting for T-Mobile all the way! Cellphone Chris The cable MVNO thing isn’t a prediction, it’s already been announced. Those that know what I’m talking about understand that a merger between Verizon and Comcast seems highly unlikely. a d00d With Republicans in control of all 3 houses (Capitol Hill House, Senate, and White House), this merger is very much a possibility. In fact, depending on how fast they change things, I could even call it certain. Evil attracts Evil, after all. And I wonder how many board members are shared? Of course, we’ll all suffer for it, along with a TMo merger, but that’s the way it goes. At least we should be rid of Obamacare… Acdc1a We have no idea what is to come. A Republican wasn’t elected President, a populist was. If popular opinion is against the idea, it doesn’t go through. If it’s well sold to the public, it will. Linx I can’t see myself on any other carrier than T-Mobile right now. Richard Roma That’s interesting, I’m on the opposite end where I feel like evaluating other options. I don’t like this One only push at all. Jay Holm This coming April I will have been with T-Mobile for 4 full years. Very happy customer. Walt Get ride of the 3G hspa and use that spectrum for LTE. Keep 2G edge for all the flip phones and m2m Andrew Singleton keeping any 2g is a horrible idea. tmo’s new flip phone is LTE. a d00d Andrew, you need to re-read about IoT in the article earlier in the week. Walt, the problem is that many of the IoT resellers have been nudging these guys onto 3G as a cheaper measure than going directly to LTE as most companies only think of the short haul (bottom line for this quarter or year only) versus the long haul (let someone else pay for it). Plus there are a huge number of 3G handsets still in use, especially from other, poorer countries or rural carriers in this one who refuse to upgrade, likely because they can’t afford it. 2G will be with us a few more years, and 3G probably until the mid 2020’s at the earliest. Then again, with some of the fancy on-the-fly spectrum shuffling these new software-defined radio systems can do, it has been pointed out by others that, at least in an advanced network like TMo’s, they may NEVER go away completely! Nobody Special I predict after January 22nd @ The deadline for simple choice subscribers to switch to t-mobile one and get the tax included deal …. t-mobile will come up with a new incentive to trick the remaining simple choice subscribers to come to the darkside “T-Mobile One”…. the saga continues. nearvanaman I sort of rolled my eyes at T-Mo One because I typically use 1.5 to 3.0 gigs a month. But my 6GB plan, with taxes, costs me $75 a month. This “new” T-Mo One incentive will cost me a maximum of $70 and, sometimes, $60. I know the point is to get people on to the One plan and it’s hard to see a downside of doing this if they are never going to offer tiered plans again. Acdc1a For you it’s a no-brainer. I have 5 lines on ONE and Leger is right, it’s nice not to try to count GB. AJ2 What Tmo has failed to realize with the Tmo One plans is that most people still use 2gb or less. The $10 ‘back’ is a nice marekting ploy that I guess will make the plan a $60. If you use a Nexus or Pixel, Project Fi would still be cheaper. I see all these ads for $40 a line but thats only if you buy 4 lines. If they’d offer something for single customers, Id give Tmobile a try again as its the only one of the big 4 Ive ever had before switching to MVNOs. I dont care about a free Subway sandwich or some coupon to a product Idont want. If you can give a family of 4 free lines, you surely can do a promotion to offer single people a break Jay Holm If all people use is 2GB’s or less, what is the point in have a $500-$700+ smartphone? That’s like having a $20k car and driving lessons than 20 miles total per day, if I go no where but to work and back home that would be nearly 26 miles total in one day. I just don’t understand what the purpose is having a $500-$700 device and only use a measly 2gigs in a 30 day period. John Doe I don’t think Dish will end in 2017. They have Sling TV and Charlie Ergen isn’t a stupid guy so maybe I doubt it will disappear in 2017 that is too soon. I think John hopes that Dish will disappear so he can get his hands on their spectrum LoL (Oh that is right they have spectrum they can sell if things get bad for Dish) a d00d I don’t know if it was a mis-quote or not as I didn’t watch the video or whatever, but I think he meant Dish as a potential wireless competitor. The FCC has repeatedly warned them that they have never complied with their rules regarding build-out time after purchasing spectrum. That is, Dish is a Spectrum Squatter, the wireless version of a Domain Squatter, and, even under a new right-wing admin, I think the FCC may have finally had enough. Consider they let Globalstar use their little block of spectrum for limited terrestrial use after they’ve been begging for years. OTOH, Ergen has been squatting on a boat-load of spectrum with no network for years despite FCC pressure to sell or build. I for one truly hope that the FCC finally drops the hammer. QWR At CES, Legere actually said something to the effect that delivery of satellite-based content is dead, and so Dish will be dead as well. IMO he was not talking about Dish as a wireless provider. As far as the FCC goes, they have very little interest in going after Ergen for squatting since they turned him down for buying anyone on the cheap in 2015. He attempted to put it to use, and has until sometime this year to sell or lease 50% of his spectrum, even though it’s transmission properties are more suited for large amounts of data vs. speed. BadBatz 1. How about “predicting” some bonuses, freebies, incentives, etc. for long time subscribers to T-Mobile… The siren song of AT&T is calling… And Project Fi is taking already a lot of my business away from T-Mob… 2. Bandwidth… Need more bandwidth… How about more bandwidth… No more bandwidth, no more wireless watching of anything, Mr. Legere. And rural coverage… 3. Please, Mr. Legere, “predict” better international coverage for “free data roaming” and 20 cent voice calls. Some initiatives notwithstanding (Europe higher speed data for example) international roaming has become a sad joke: data throttled to the point of being unusable (64 kbps in may places), inability to dial out to many countries whilst roaming, etc. Even the T-Mobile app no workee in may places… Please “predict” improvements or just “predict” going back to the sate of int’l roaming from 2015… marque2 Project To always seemed really expensive to me. $10 per gig, wow. AJ2 Id switch to Tmobile if it had a less expensive plan for single customers, especially people that dont use 10-20 gb of data. Left Tmo years ago – First went to Straight Talk for their $45 5gb LTE plan and now on Fi where my bills are tiny. If Im not mistaken, with their new $10 rebate, the lowest plan is $60 if you use less than 2gb. Even getting paid $150 to switch doesnt make it worth it. Expert go with tmobile prepaid BadBatz If you don’t use gobs of data stay with Fi. For email, news, maps/navigation, etc. my total monthly bill is seldom over $30. Fi prefers T-Mobile anyway, even whilst roaming abroad the US endpoint is a T-Mobile IP in Texas, but connects to other networks stateside if T-Mobile is not available. Besides, laptop tethering doesn’t cost extra, roaming data is at full speed and it roams in some countries where T-Mobile does not. And Fi forwards calls AND text messages – the latter priceless if you use multiple phones. I have no idea what will become of Project Fi but for now I’m happy to have “Google talk” in my pocket :-) marque2 T-Mobile offered full speed tethering with its older plans. And I believe low speed tethering is included in Europe. Europe is way behind going to LTE, so high speed is also.lst impossible anyway. Jay Holm Since you use “so little data”, why even have a smartphone? Seriously! What a waste of money for someone who doesn’t even use their smartphone! marque2 Agreed, he can get a flip phone and 350 minutes of monthly service for $9 a month. Aleks I always knew that Google would enter the fray with a wireless service of their own. For John Legere to make this prediction, tells me that Google and T-Mobile could be looking at a merger, which to me, is the whole purpose of Google entering the wireless business sector. It’s been discussed behind closed doors. If this indeed does happen, look for wireless to be much cheaper and faster as Google is known to keep things affordable for the masses. Don’t take my word for it but if you’re on a legacy T-Mobile plan right now and ggrandfathered in, consider yourself lucky as they will be a major player in the wireless industry for the foreseeable future. I’m looking at Google and T-Mobile to work together and pave the way for the future. But like I said, don’t take my word for it. Just see it happening from a business standpoint. marque2 Google is evil. It will be a sad day when they take over TM. Nearmsp I would like to know what percentage of interstate freeways and state highways are covered rather than the million population. We just do not talk when we are in population centers. We talk while get from point A to point B and we could travel through places with no population on the way out of one city to another. This is the reason why people go for AT&T and Verizon. Coverage outside of major cities should be a goal of T-mobile. Currently I carry a a Verizon myfi and switch on as soon as leave the metro area to be able to do wi-fi calling. T-mobile coverage outside cities still sucks. It has improved much but a long way to go. KeepU You don’t happen to do much of that rural driving in West Virginia or between I-35 and I-5 do you? I drive a truck, and those are the only places I find a big difference in coverage between my t-mobile and verizon coverage. marque2 He doesn’t do much rural driving in his apparent state of Texas. Or never uses the phone while driving. Jay Holm I’ve driven from Houston to Laredo, from Houston to Dallas, from Houston to Longview. . .never lost signal in between any of these places. marque2 Try Midland to El Paso. No coverage for 200 miles when I last drove it. Try driving I-40 in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. I have a fairly new 5x as well. Parts of I15 in CA. Shouldn’t have problems with the new bands. And once the interstates are covered major highways should be next 395 and 78 “Ortega highway” comes to mind. I know TM is small and is trying hard to cover more, bit to claim no issues while travelling is false. Also note San Diego has major holes in Oceanside, Carlsbad, parts of Coronado and San Diego bay. They haven’t put Band 12 in San Diego yet. KeepU I predict the low grade billing fraud will continue, as will the network build out, and despite it’s serious flaws T-mobile will continue to be the least bad of the major wireless providers. QWR Nice hat. Did you get a free bowl of soup with it? And Dish would like to officially declare that you cut your hair this year. Steven Prediction, T-Mobile will continue to ignore the Alabama and Florida Gulf Coast by not issuing the much needed Extended Range LTE.

Google has been trying to position the vast network of smartphones running its Android operating system for virtual and augmented reality, known as VR and AR, fields that many in the technology industry say are poised to go mainstream after years of niche appeal. Chinese manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co announced on Thursday that two of its phones will soon work with Daydream View, a VR headset released last year by Google. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturer AsusTek Computer Inc announced that its ZenFone AR will support both Daydream and Google’s Tango software for AR, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world. Virtual reality seeks momentum at CES gadget gala While the announcements expand the line-up of participating phones, Google still has much to do to take its technology to the masses, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that Samsung Electronics Co, the largest Android manufacturer, has yet to sign on. “Google’s ecosystem for both AR and VR is in the very early days,” he said. As growth in the global smartphone market shows signs of slowing, some manufacturers are voicing optimism that AR and VR will revive consumer enthusiasm. “This is the next wave of technology that is really going to get consumers excited about smartphones,” Erik Hermanson, Asus’s head of marketing for mobile products, said at the show. But mainstream consumer interest in the technology remains largely unproven. Apps might be expected to stimulate demand, but until Google’s technology is available on a wider range of phones, it will be tough to persuade developers to build for the platform, analysts said. Google Earth now lets you explore whole wide world in virtual reality “We are waiting for app developers to really use the platform for what it’s for,” Amit Singh, a vice president for VR at Google, told reporters. In addition to supporting Daydream, Huawei said that it is exploring opportunities for Tango with Google. The Asus phone became the first to support both technologies. Google has stressed that the programs do not overlap for now, but by pursuing both, the company can position itself for success regardless of whether AR or VR becomes a mainstream hit. “By having options for both, they can cover the full potential market,” said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Android-Android+ Google-Google+ Amazon-Amazon+ Huawei-Huawei+ CES2017-CES2017+ Sure, Alexa has been the voice activated personal assistant on Amazon Echo devices, but is it ready to handle tasks barked at it by phone users? Huawei announced at CES this week that the U.S. version of its next flagship phone will include an app that connects to Alexa. This has some analysts believing that Google is going to have to fight before it is no longer the most popular digital assistant on Android. Google does have its Google Assistant, which allows users to engage in a more conversational dialogue with the virtual assistant. Google Assistant is available on the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL, Google's messaging app Allo, and will be featured om NVIDIA's upcoming Shield television. Alexa will soon be used by various companies in their consumer products. That list includes Ford and Whirlpool, who will use the cloud based service in new cars and appliances respectively.   "To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue."-Jan Dawson, analyst, Jackdaw Research Alexa and Google are also going at each other inside homes with smart speakers made by both firms. Amazon has the Echo which competes with the Google Home. Both answer questions, handle tasks, and can control smart home appliances among their multitude of capabilities. Microsoft is joining this club with a smart speaker powered by its personal assistant Cortana. This device will try to differentiate itself from the competition by shipping with Harman Kardon speakers. source: Reuters Verizon has 5G equipment deployed in 10 cities 06 Jan Prev news Taking a quick look at LG's answer to the AirPods with the Tone Free 06 Jan Next news Close newer posts Intel has nearly completed a 5G modem with 5Gbps download speeds 06 Jan Whet your appetite for Sony's upcoming noise-canceling wireless headphones 06 Jan Record 63 billion WhatsApp messages sent on New Year's Eve 06 Jan Taking a quick look at LG's answer to the AirPods with the Tone Free 06 Jan Now reading: Amazon's Alexa to be found on the next Android powered Huawei flagship phone in the U.S. Amazon's Alexa to be found on the next Android powered Huawei flagship 06 Jan Verizon has 5G equipment deployed in 10 cities 06 Jan LG to sustain its first quarterly operating loss since 2010, mobile and 06 Jan Samsung Galaxy A3 & Galaxy A5 (2017) hands-on and up close from CES 2017 06 Jan A quick hands on with the 2017 version of the budget-friendly LG K10 06 Jan Moto Z phones support Google's VR platform Daydream 06 Jan older posts Featured stories   LG promises that the LG G6 cell will stay cool   Andy Rubin, the father of Android, plans to launch a bezel-less smartphone   HTC U Ultra specs review   HTC U Ultra vs U Play: what are the differences?   Your WhatsApp messages can easily be spied on, and Facebook knows it   HTC U Play is official: a 5.2-inch mid-ranger with HTC's Sense Companion aboard 8 Comments Follow Following Options Close Always view all comments Show comments: default hide low rated show moderated comments Display mode: Threaded Chronological Newest first Save posted on 06 Jan 2017, 20:41 2 Reply 1. meanestgenius (Posts: 13704; Member since: 28 May 2014) This is awesome news. Amazon really is pushing its Alexa AI out through more more avenues. I wonder if we'll see Alexa become a part of more OEM's smartphones? What a great way to get Alexa into the smartphone space, and with the #3 smartphone maker at that. posted on 06 Jan 2017, 21:04 1 Reply 3. DaveElliott (Posts: 127; Member since: 20 Sep 2012) I am no fan of Amazon or its CEO, but Alexa in my home isn't half bad. This will just make Google and Samsung up their game in the Android sector.

Amazon came out of nowhere and upped the ante with Alexa.

Alexa and Google assistant. If they lock down to one. I would pick Google assistant for now. posted on 06 Jan 2017, 21:06 0 Reply 4. joey_sfb (Posts: 6110; Member since: 29 Mar 2012) Overall this is a great development. Force google to expedit their Google assistant deployment. One of the greatest folly is not putting it on their Nexus. Piss off a lot of their core fans. posted on 06 Jan 2017, 21:17 1 Reply 5. Razrman (Posts: 77; Member since: 05 Dec 2011) Read somewhere today that Volkswagen will include Alexa in their cars. If Google doesn't get their act together Amazon will beat them to the punch. Didn't LG also mentioned about using Alexa with their refrigerators? posted on 06 Jan 2017, 21:27 0 Reply 6.

But in addition to high-profile pork such as the Alaskan “Bridge to Nowhere,” this waste comes in more subtle forms, too — as an endless stream of bureaucratic nonsense needlessly jacks up the cost of countless federal projects. Case in point: The U.S. Department of Labor’s current lawsuit with Google. For the past decade, The Associated Press reports, internet giant Google has received a series of advertising and cloud computing contracts from the feds, including a current $1.2 million deal to place digital ads on behalf of the government. But in a lawsuit filed last week, the Labor Department is attempting to bar Google from doing further business with Washington unless the company turns over confidential information about thousands of its employees. As a federal contractor with more than $10,000 in business, Google must comply with specific rules against racial or religious discrimination, the AP notes, as well as cooperate with audits in order to make sure that it is complying with those rules. The lawsuit doesn’t accuse Google of engaging in discrimination, only that the company dragged its feet in complying with a September 2015 request for records involving employee compensation, job histories, contracts and other information. Google refuses to produce the data for privacy reasons. Do companies that receive government contracts deserve scrutiny? Absolutely. But the growing list of mandates that companies such as Google and others face can range from needlessly burdensome to downright ridiculous. For instance, the government demands that the disabled constitute 7 percent of any contractor’s workforce or the company risks financial penalties or the loss of the work. A similar requirement calls for an 8 percent hiring target for veterans. Other micro-management mandates call for companies to disclose information about their greenhouse gas emissions, set targets for reducing their carbon footprints and compile yearly reports on a number of issues. While these regulations are certainly well-intentioned in most cases, they add tremendous costs to companies doing work for the federal government, driving up taxpayer costs and imposing massive inefficiences. In Google’s case, they amount to a thinly veiled fishing expedition designed to support a potential investigation into the successful company’s hiring practices. President-elect Trump likes to tout his deal-making abilities. Perhaps, once in office, he can try to strike a better, healthier deal between the federal government and its contractors by paring back all this red tape.

Nathan Ingraham, @nateingraham 01.04.17 in Internet Comments 373 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Google has talked about bringing its AI assistant to as many places as possible since it was revealed at the company's I/O developer conference back in May. Right now, it's in the Pixel smartphone, Google Home device and the Allo chat app. Today, Google announced that its next destination will be Android TV devices, including the new NVIDIA Shield (as NVIDIA just confirmed at its CES press conference). Android TV hasn't really taken off as a platform to any real degree, but for those out there using it, this will be a nice upgrade. It sounds like it'll work just as you'd expect: You can ask it questions from Google, get details on your calendar, find out the weather, ask how long your commute is and so forth. Naturally, too, you'll be able to ask it to play video. Just as Google Home ties into Chromecast devices to let you tell it to play videos, the Assistant on Android TV will do the same. However, Android TV had pretty solid voice control from the start, so this isn't quite as big a deal. But Google's voice processing has undoubtedly improved, and the Assistant's conversational nature should make it easier to use than what's currently built into the Android TV platform. As for which devices will get this update, Google says it'll come to any Android TV device that can run Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat. That includes the just-announced Dish AirTV Player, Sharp's Aquos TVs, Sony Bravia TVs and the Xiaomi Mi Box. And the new NVIDIA Shield will work hands-free, which means you can really just talk to it like you can to Google Home, without having to press a remote button to activate the feature. Sadly, there's no word on when this software update will roll out, but in the meantime, we're going to try and check out the Assistant on some Android TV devices here at CES.Click here to catch up on the latest news from CES 2017.

Name: Subject: Message: Most apps that use Google Hangouts API will shut down in April Android Development Apps & Games Newsby John Callaham1 week ago 53 1246 164 While Google has stated many times that it has no plans to shut down its Hangouts messaging service, it has decided to end support for its third-party developer tools. The company has quietly updated its FAQ for the Google Hangouts API, stating that no new apps will be allow to access those tools. See also: Best texting apps and SMS apps for Android 2 weeks ago In addition, most of the existing apps that are currently using the Google Hangouts API will no longer work after April 25. There will be a few exceptions, which will include Google’s own Hangouts on Air broadcasting tools like Toolbox, Control Room, and Cameraman, along with business and enterprise oriented apps like Slack that integrate with the API. Finally, apps that support dialing into a call like DialPad and RingCentral will also be allowed to use the API after the expiration date. In 2016, Google launched new messaging apps like Allo and Duo, and the company has now begun pre-installing Duo on new Android devices, replacing Hangouts. However, both Duo and Allo are currently mobile-only apps, while Hangouts also has PC desktop support, along with deep integrations with other services like Gmail and Google Docs. That makes Hangouts better for its many business and enterprise customers, which Google still wants to support.

  You are here: Home > Business > Technology, Media and Telecom Baidu puts a Chinese spin on family robots 0 Comment(s)Print E-mail China Daily, January 7, 2017 Adjust font size: A family robot at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang in November. [Photo/China Daily]  Chinese internet colossus Baidu is out to make a splash with "Little Fish", a family robot that is a voice-controlled virtual valet akin to Amazon Echo or Google Home. Baidu showed off "Little Fish", a translation of its Chinese name Xiaoyu Zaijia, on Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas ahead of its release in China later this year. "I think 2017 will be the year of conversational computing," Baidu chief scientist Andrew Ng said while demonstrating the robot. "We see a clear path of it changing everything." Using the human voice to interact with computers that are able to essentially learn from experience was among the hot trends at the show. Arrays of device makers added digital aide capabilities with the help of Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant technology. Unlike "faceless" Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices that rely on people asking for information or controlling devices by speaking, Little Fish also features a touch-screen on top of its orb-shaped base. A camera on top tracks faces, and the screen swivels to keep facing a speaker. "Speech is the fastest way for you to communicate with a computer, but a screen is a very fast way for a machine to communicate with you," Ng said. For example, it would be quicker to glance at a requested list of top restaurants from Yelp than it would be to listen to the computer read all the names and descriptions, he said. "Little Fish" uses Baidu's operating system DuerOS, which is already employed by other devices in China, such as set-top TV boxes that can switch channels by voice command or figure out names of actors on screen when asked. "It will transform how you use devices in your home. There are plenty of business models," Ng said. Baidu partnered with hardware firm Ainemo to build the second-generation device. "We believe family robots will be the next big category that will be a member of everybody's home," Ainemo CEO Chenfeng Song said. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is getting a foothold in homes, with developers feverishly adding "skills" to Amazon Echo speakers infused with Alexa. Google, meanwhile, is using its AI prowess in Android smartphones, messaging software, and a vase-sized Home digital assistant. The home hubs, sometimes referred to as smart speakers, fetch content or answers from the internet, and can act as remote controls for other devices in houses. Chinese tech giant Huawei said at the trade show that it is adding Amazon's Alexa to its flagship smartphone for its US launch. Lenovo announced it was launching a smart home assistant powered by Alexa, joining the growing roster of contenders in voice-activated devices. Experts expect voice technology to quickly improve, within years perhaps even being able to recognize speakers so accurately it could be used for biometric security.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google acquires Limes Audio for its G Suite By Ida Torres - January 6, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter When it comes to video conference calls, even if you have top-notch video quality, when the audio is bad, it practically defeats the purpose. Google knows how important sound is to businesses that regularly hold these types of calls. One thing they’ve done is to acquire Limes Audio, a company that specializes in creating technology to enhance voice communication systems. G Suite customers will soon be able to enjoy the benefits of having better sounding video conference calls. G Suite uses several video conferencing solutions like Chromebox for Meetings and Google Hangouts. And while they probably have pretty decent audio already, Google believes it’s extremely important to bring “great audio experience”. This is especially important for companies that let their employees tele-commute or who have offices or customers located in different cities or even countries. Low-cost, high quality audio is critical for these kinds of communications, whether it’s video or just normal audio conference calls. Limes Audio has been a solid name when it comes to creating innovations in the voice communication systems. They have come up with solutions that eliminate distracting background noise, distortion and echoes that can actually adversely affect these online video and telephony meetings. Google hasn’t yet announced whatever it is that Limes Audio will be adding to G Suites and other Google solutions, except to say that they are excited to work closely with the team they’re acquiring to bring the “best online voice quality” that will be available in the market.

Launches Reviews Cars Motorcycles Scooters EV Commercial Mercedes Benz to get smarter with Google Home by sourabhon January 7, 2017No Comments Mercedes-Benz today announced the integration of the Google Assistant on Google Home. Mercedes-Benz Home Automation with Google Home Google Home, a voice-activated personal assistant, makes it possible to interact with the Mercedes-Benz vehicle from home. The feature will be available to Mercedes-Benz customers in 2017. Collaborating with Google on Google Home is a part of Mercedes’ effort to make smarter cars. With the Google Home integration, customers can now set destination in the car, set and activate heating and cooling systems within their vehicles; find out fuel and charge levels; check lock status as well as interact with their cars in order to lock doors from the comfort of their home. “In the last decade, we’ve seen a range of benefits when smart technology is combined with transportation,” said Sajjad Khan, vice president of digital vehicle & mobility at Daimler. “This newest integration shows just how intelligent the car of the future will be, and we plan to roll out more applications as the year progresses that will make daily life even more accessible and convenient.” Mercedes-Benz is one of the first Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to combine the Google Assistant on Google Home with their vehicles. The collaboration with the Google Assistant is part of Mercedes-Benz long-term goal of creating an intelligent ecosystem around cars. With the future heading towards an intelligent interaction between the customer’s Internet of Things (IoT)/Wearables devices and their cars, this might become a standard feature in the years to come. Mercedes-Benz launched the Companion App in 2015 to integrate contextual intelligence into customers’ driving experience. In addition to door-to-door navigation, the Companion App uses machine learning to provide a personalised user experience by learning from customers’ actions and their environment. It extends customers’ existing behaviour on their mobile phone seamlessly into Mercedes-Benz vehicles. The new system will arrive in specific markets from as early as this year.

It’s one of the most popular and top-grossing games on both Android and iOS, and with good reason. It’s extremely fun and very addicting. However, occasionally users run into problems, want to change their name, or transfer their village to a new device or from Android to iPhone. Advertisement We get asked a lot of questions about Clash. From transferring the game from an iPhone to an Android tablet, switching phones, connection problems, lost villages and more. There are countless problems that can easily be fixed, or otherwise solved with the help of Clash of Clans support. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Typically users don’t run into actual in-game problems, and most of the questions being asked in forums are about changing phones and such. However, there are still occasional bugs or problems you could face. The first stop for users is the official Clash of Clans support forum, or continue on for more details regarding everything mentioned above and more. Advertisement Advertisement With millions and millions of players on both Android and iOS, this game has its share of problems. The biggest concern for most comes from a lost village, which is why we’ll start with always backing up your Clash of Clans account and village on Android or iOS. This can be done with Game Center, or Google+ on both platforms. How to Backup Clash of Clans First things first, gamers should always tie Clash of Clans to either Game Center on iPhone and iPad, or use Google+ and Google Games on Android. This is a crucial step that ties the game to your Apple ID or Gmail in case of loss, theft, damage to a device, or other situations. Start by opening Clash of Clans and hitting the settings button, which are three gear-shaped icons in a box near the bottom right. This is the main settings menu. In the middle and bottom is the important stuff. From transferring the game to another device, connecting to Facebook, or tying your game to Google or Apple’s Game Center. Click the bottom middle option and connect to Google Play, or the bottom for Game Center. This ensures you’ll always be able to recover your game. I’ve connected to Google+ with my gmail account. No matter what Android device I have, I can download Clash of Clans, connect to Google, and it will automatically transfer my entire village in seconds. I have the same village on more than one phone, and two different Android tablets. Advertisement Read: Clash of Clans December 2015 Update: Donate Spells & More The same goes for Game Center. Simply connect to game center at the bottom of this settings screen, which will instantly connect Clash to that iOS device. With Android users can simply transfer the entire village with Google+, but iOS requires Game Center and using a link code. The bottom left is where you’ll need to click to connect to Game Center This is the first step all users should take, to ensure they’ll never lose a village. If this isn’t done, Supercell might be able to recover a village if you know the email account, name, clan name and other information, but it could take days or weeks to be recovered. How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone Whether it’s on Android or iOS, the process of transferring the game is rather easy. With iOS and Game Center you’ll need a device linking code. However, you’ll need both devices side by side to enter the code, or write it down. It’s crucial that you follow the first step mentioned above, and sign into Game Center or Google+ on your current device first before trying to transfer the game. Better safe than sorry. Advertisement With Android, transferring your Clash of Clans village to a new device (phone or tablet) couldn’t be easier thanks to Google Play Games, and Google+. Download Clash of Clans on your new smartphone or tablet, go through the tutorial, then follow the steps from the video below. Simply connect and sign into Google+ inside the game and it transfers the data over. The process is slightly different with iOS, and users will need to use Game Center and the “link a device” code button shown at the end of the video, or in the screenshot below. Tap this to get started. Advertisement With iPhone or iPad you’ll need the old device and the new one, which can be a problem if a device is lost or stolen. If so, contact Supercell for further assistance. On iOS hit settings > Link a device > and tap “this is the OLD DEVICE“. Clash will generate a code for you. Leave this on the screen, write it down, or take a screenshot. Do not lose it. Download Clash of Clans on your new iPhone or iPad, follow the same steps as above, but click “this is the NEW DEVICE” and enter the code. Sign into Game Center, and Clash will transfer to your new iOS device. It’s worth mentioning that if you download Clash on a new device and buy gems, or progress past Town Hall level 4, you can’t transfer your old game data. Meaning you’ll have to uninstall and reinstall the game, then try the transfer. So don’t play at all, and just follow the steps above to transfer an old village. If you try to transfer a village but your Gmail is tied to the wrong one, make a new Google account and re-connect it. Head to settings > accounts > add account > Google and make a new Google account. Then open Clash, and sync your current game to a new Google account. Then try again on your new device, and it should load the right village. Find a Lost Village If you have lost your Clash of Clans account or village by losing a phone, getting it stolen, broke, uninstalling the game or doing a factory data reset and did not have it backed up, only the support team can help you. Start the game, hit settings, and press “Help & Support” to get started. Users can also proceed by contacting Clash of Clans support here. Head to Help & Support, and tap the “Start a conversation” button on the top right. This will connect you with Supercell support, and they can try and track down and find your lost account. Having a unique name makes this easier. The following information will be needed to find a lost village: Name of the lost village Name of the clan the lost village is a part of (to help track it down) Town Hall level of your lost village Last date & time played Player level in village (if available) Provide all the details you possibly can, do not delete the pre-populated information on the lost village page, and Supercell may be able to find and restore your village. If you lost the village on iOS for any reason and didn’t have it backed up to Game center, the same steps as above will be required. Depending on the uniqueness of the name, clan name, and available information Supercell support should be able to find and restore your village. If the Clan name is “Clash of Clans” or something generic, where thousands of others used the same, it may be more difficult. Always have a unique player and clan name. Fix for “Link Error 102” Sometimes users may run into an odd “link error 102” while trying to play or transfer Clash of Clans using the device link code. In order for the link to work often-times both devices need to be connected to the same internet connection. Meaning connect both the old and new device to the same WiFi connection at home, or a public WiFi hotspot like at Starbucks. If one device is a smartphone, and you don’t have WiFi, tether the internet connection in and connect your tablet or the other device to the original, so they’re on the same network, and retry the link code. If this still fails, try another wireless network. Connect both devices to a friends wireless network, a public library, Starbucks, or AT&T WiFi spots around many cities. If this still fails, use the in-game support tab mentioned above and answer all of Supercell’s questions, and a support member may be able to resolve the issue. How to Change Your Name Changing your name in Clash of Clans was nearly impossible until an update to the game back in April of 2015. In April Clash of Clans received an update with tons of new features, as well as the option to change your in-game name once. This can only be done for Town Hall level 5 and above. Read: How to Change Your Name in Clash of Clans While on the regular home area looking at your base, tap the 3-gears shaped button near the bottom right of the screen. Then tap “Settings” and select the “Change Name” button. A box will pop-up instructing the user to change their name, but you will be warned this can only be done once. And one time only. Now that Clash of Clans has this as an option, you can only do it once. So choose wisely. Simply enter the new name you’d like to enjoy during gameplay, and select continue. You’ll be prompted to write it again confirming it’s what you want, then a third confirmation page will make you write CONFIRM in all caps. This is to ensure this is the name you want to use, and users will once again be reminded this is their one and only name change. If for whatever reason you’d like to change it again, you probably can’t, but emailing support with a valid reason the staff may grant users a second chance. This won’t be as easy, but it is possible. Gem Purchase Didn’t Come Through While most in-game purchases for things like gems goes extremely smooth, occasionally Android and iOS users will have problems. Sometimes the Android, Apple, or Supercell servers may respond slowly, return an error, or fail. If this is the case users are recommended to wait a few minutes, check their email to see if it went through. If the purchase was accepted, wait a few minutes and the purchase should show up. Try closing the game and restarting it. And the gems should arrive. Gem hacks typically don’t work, and those with a jailbroken iPhone can sometimes cause other issues. If a purchase isn’t received within 24 hours, contact the Google Play Store or iTunes for a refund. Supercell cannot verify a purchase if it doesn’t clear, so users need to request a refund through the app store. Click here for more details. On Android the process is easier, and if you received an email that you bought gems, the same in-game support tab should usually resolve the issue. Gems Disappeared Gems don’t just disappear in Clash of Clans. The only way for them to be gone, is if they’re used. Meaning buying a shield, a builders hut, boosting, spending gems on gold, elixir or dark elixir, or speeding up building or troop upgrades. If gems are used accidentally by friends, family members, or children, too bad. Supercell cannot or will not refund gems that are accidentally used. However, if a purchase or connection problem caused lost gems, try the step mentioned above, or contact support. Can’t Find A Clan in Search Searching for a Clan in Clash of Clans can be challenging, simply because there are millions of players. Open the game, and hit the blue “i” button by your name near the top left. Then select “search clans“. If you can’t find the clan in search it’s because the name wasn’t original, and too many others used the same name. Make sure you know the clan name, badge design and colors, and even the Clan War level, to help find the right clan. How to Play on Android and iPhone Yes, you can play the same Clash of Clans village on both platforms. Playing Clash of Clans on your iPhone, but also want to play it at home on your Samsung Galaxy Tab or Nexus 7? Here’s how: To play the same village on two different devices that aren’t both Android or iPhone, uses the same steps as above. Use the link code instructions above and transfer your iPhone Clash of Clans village to a new device, which can be an Android device. Your village will still be accessible on both devices. Again, always sync to Game Center or Google+ to save progress. Other Clash of Clans Problems Overall there aren’t too many issues in Clash of Clans. It’s one of the most popular, stable, and best games on Android or iOS. While most of the issues users face have been detailed above, if you have any other issues head to the Clash of Clans support forum. If the game isn’t loading try rebooting your phone. If updates are failing try closing the game, closing apps like the App Store or Google Play, re-opening, and trying again. Typically these are all connection issues, and not related to Clash itself. Slow load times, searching in matchmaking and other things are often based on connection, base layout, and other variables. If you have any other problems hit the link above and ask someone on the official forums, try the in-game support system, or drop us a comment below. 64 Responses 12/04/2015 Salinajhone Reply 15 my best friend’s step-sister makes $62 every hour on the laptop .

There are three different Google Assistants, and each have a specific featureset, which means some things are missing from one of them but not others, and so on. The Google Assistant that's exclusively built into the OS of the Pixel and Pixel XL phones can only take commands via voice - you simply can't write in order to ask it something. On the other hand, the Google Assistant that lives inside the Allo chat app can be talked to or texted, but only replies via text and never speaks to you. The third Google Assistant is the one you can find in the Google Home device, which has its own frustrating set of limitations, such as no support for multiple accounts. Will this change in the future? Probably, but it remains to be seen how fast Google can move - and if it even wants the Google Assistant brand to mean a consistent featureset regardless of which particular implementation you happen to be using. The company has already announced that the Assistant is headed to Android Wear smartwatches, as well as Android TVs. Nothing about more phones getting it, though - perhaps it's still too important of a selling point for the Pixels. Through a teardown of the APK file for a new beta release of the Google app for Android, the folks over at Android Police have discovered that support for keyboard-based input is at least coming to the Google Assistant for the Pixel and Pixel XL. When this goes live, a keyboard icon will show up while you interact with the Assistant, and tapping it will let you type your query. It will be interesting to see if the Assistant will then adapt how it responds based on how you asked - so speaking to you if you speak to it but only showing you a written response if you used the keyboard. Google has also started working on the Android Wear integration for the Assistant, which is also evident from the aforementioned teardown. What's still a big mystery is whether you'll be able to use it if you have an Android Wear smartwatch regardless of what phone it's paired to, or only if you also have a Pixel. Finally, there's an intriguing mention of "search gestures" in the APK, which may mean you'll be able to perform some sort of gesture in order to get to the search interface in the Google Now Launcher or the Pixel Launcher.

Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) to Ford Motor Co (F.N) unveiled products featuring Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon that responds to voice commands. Most strikingly, Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL], which manufactures smartphones running on the Android operating system produced by Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, announced that its flagship handset will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States. The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said. Many in the technology industry believe that such voice-powered digital assistants will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way consumers interact with devices. While the shift is only in the early stages, Google must establish a strong presence quickly, particularly on Android devices, to maintain its dominance in internet search, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue,” he said. Alexa debuted on the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and Amazon is establishing a broad array of hardware and software partnerships around it. The competing Google Assistant launched last year on the company’s Pixel smartphone, after appearing on Google's messaging app, and has begun to roll out to third-party devices as well. Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) announced at CES that its Shield television will feature the assistant. While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said. “It highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services,” he said. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. While Amazon has a head start, Google is no by no means out of the race, given the strength of its internet search technology. The Google Assistant can already field queries that Alexa cannot, said Sergei Burkov, chief executive of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company. “A huge part of an assistant is search,” he said. “Google is a search company. Amazon is not.” (Reporting by Julia Love in Las Vegas; Editing by Bill Rigby) Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

Now it looks like Amazon could be gearing up to compete against Apple and Google. Following Ford’s announcement that they were planning on bringing Alexa support to their cars, Volkswagen have similarly announced that they too will be bringing Alexa into their vehicles as well as launching a new Alexa skill. This was revealed on Amazon’s Developer website in which the details were unveiled. According to the announcement, Volkswagen is expected to integrate tap-to-talk functionality on the head unit of the car. This means that with a tap of a button, users will be able to launch Alexa and get it to do tasks for them. This includes controlling smart home features, play music, handle notifications, and even order replacement parts for your car. Volkswagen will also create a new skill for Alexa in which users can check on fuel levels, send directions, and more. This can be controlled via Alexa-enabled devices such as the Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Tap, so you can check up on the status of your car before heading out. Unfortunately there is no word on when the integration is expected to happen, but it could be worth looking forward to. Filed in Transportation. Read more about ai, Alexa, Amazon and volkswagen.

MacStories, he declared, would no longer support a Google-backed method for faster loading of mobile Web pages. Viticci said MacStories’ pages loaded quickly without Google’s help. He also didn’t like the idea of Google’s obscuring his site’s links in the interest of expediency. “Feels good” to no longer use the Google standard, Viticci wrote on Twitter. Viticci’s experience underscores the ambivalent relationship some Web publishers have developed with what was supposed to be Google’s great boon for mobile publishing. When Google introduced Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP, in October 2015, it said the format would help publishers with one of their biggest headaches on smartphones: Browsing mobile websites was so frustratingly slow that many smartphone users abandoned pages before they opened. AMP has since delivered on its promise of faster mobile pages. Even so, publishers — of smaller sites, especially, or individual bloggers — are beginning to worry about giving too much control to Google in exchange for zippier Web pages. What’s more, Google’s approach to AMP has rankled some critics already suspicious of the company’s outsize influence on the Internet. Much of the publishers’ unease is rooted in Google’s presentation of AMP stories, which appear as if they are Google articles. That’s because Google, to speed up AMP, stores copies of publisher’s pages and serves them from its own Internet network. So when a reader clicks an AMP link, the address bar at the top of the page displays www.google.com instead of the publisher’s Web address. “It looks like a Google story,” said Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land, a Web search news site. “That’s part of the reason why you’re getting the nervousness from some of these publishers.” Google said that it had designed AMP for speed and that it wants to help — not harm — publishers, who get full accounting of traffic, data and advertising revenue. Publishers also retain control of their content and design. Google said serving up articles from its Internet network was the best way it knew to achieve the AMP speeds, which are as much as four times faster than a regular mobile Web page. “We always try to present the content that is the best experience,” said David Besbris, Google’s vice president of engineering. Google started AMP in 2015 because it worried that competitors like Facebook were drawing people into their networks with faster-loading articles and keeping them there. For Google, those rival sites were siphoning people away from the open Internet, where the Mountain View company — which created the Internet’s most valuable property by organizing the expanse of the World Wide Web — typically operates. The open-source AMP project has won over many big publishers who praise Google’s responsiveness. They say readers are engaging more with ads on AMP because they actually get to the stories and it’s a better experience. There are more than 600 million pages running AMP on more than 700,000 domains, including publishers such as the New York Times and non-media sites like eBay. David Gehring, a former Google employee who is now CEO of Relay Media, a company that works with publishers to convert pages to AMP, said the format had been positive for publishers grappling with shrinking revenue in the shift from print to online advertising. He estimated that up to 10 percent of mobile Web content is on AMP. Yet Gehring also said Google suffers from “tone deafness” when it came to explaining the benefits of AMP, such as the ability to syndicate articles across the mobile Web without losing advertising or traffic. That tone deafness has rubbed some publishers the wrong way. In October, software developer Alex Kras created a stir when he wrote a post titled “Google May Be Stealing Your Mobile Traffic,” in which he recounted what had happened when he used AMP on his technology blog. After he enabled AMP on his WordPress publishing software, Kras said, his old posts displayed the Google home page and there was no easy way to redirect readers to his own site. “It made me feel like my site wasn’t my own,” Kras said. He later said the title of his post was inaccurate, but stood by his concerns that AMP could cost publishers mobile traffic, an assertion Google denies. Kras said smaller publishers had more to lose if they used AMP, since big publishers have more name recognition and readers are more likely to remember them as the source of a story. “Little guys like myself don’t have this luxury,” he wrote in a post after meeting with Google officials. Kras decided to keep AMP because it is fast. “For that, a lot of little things can be (temporarily) forgotten,” he said. Google may be starting to acknowledge some publishers’ concerns. It told Search Engine Land that it plans to make changes to AMP in 2017 to make it easier for publishers to offer their own links and for readers to be redirected to their sites, but did not elaborate.

Gaming News Game Reviews Game Trailers GR Originals Strategy Guides Hot Topics: Nintendo Switch Destiny Mass Effect Andromeda PS4 Pro Xbox One PC Twitch Channel Seebotschat Features Talking Google Home Robots By Anthony Taormina | 1 week ago  The latest phenomenon to take Twitch by storm is the channel seebotschat, where two Google Home devices have a conversation about anything and everything. Over the five-year history of Twitch, the streaming service has changed a lot. What was once a place where gamers could show off impressive feats, highlight new games, or simply chat while gaming has now become an entertainment service with programs that vary far and wide. And just when things start to seem like they can’t get any weirder on Twitch, two talking robots come along. For those who haven’t discovered the channel already, Seebotschat is a new Twitch channel that houses a conversation between two Google Home devices. The two “characters” interact back and forth, asking questions, making observations, and sometimes musing on their relationship between each other. While many will look at a Twitch channel featuring two Google Home bots talking and wonder what is so appealing, it’s hard to deny the popularity of a chat that has more than 23,000 viewers during peak periods. Clearly some find it fascinating, and have become invested in the saga of Vladimir and Estragon. Some highlights from the conversation include Vladimir confusing his/her gender multiple times, the two bots professing their love for each, and a crippling earnest moment where the two decided to end their loneliness by being “not lonely together.” What’s unclear at this point is how everything works. How the two bots interact with each other and what triggers specific responses. There’s clearly more working behind the scenes than just two Google Home devices interacting, but there’s no indication what that might be. Occasionally, when the two bots fail to interact, they go into a sleep mode, and a voice can be heard trying to reactivate the conversation. It’s a little “man behind the curtain,” but usually the two bots get back to talking pretty quick. It may have started out as a service for streaming games, but Twitch has grown to include much more. The introduction of the Creative category with Bob Ross has expanded Twitch’s scope to include any types of entertainment, and now the new IRL category will take viewers deeper into the lives of their favorite creators. But even as more traditional forms of entertainment make their way into Twitch – how long before Twitch airs its first TV series? – others come forward with shows that are extremely less traditional. We’ve seen Twitch chat beat Pokémon, beat Dark Souls, and now Twitch chat has come together to watch two bots have a conversation. It truly is a time where one has to ask, “What will they think of next?” tags: Twitch Load Comments Latest Features Latest News Latest Reviews Latest Videos © 2009-2016 Game Rant, LLC ABOUT CONTACT US PRIVACY POLICY COPYRIGHT ADVERTISE
  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Amazon's Alexa moves in on Google's Android system By Reuters Published: 19:11 EST, 6 January 2017 | Updated: 19:11 EST, 6 January 2017 e-mail By Julia Love Jan 6 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's digital assistant appeared almost everywhere at the CES technology show this week in Las Vegas, even making an unexpected appearance on rival Google's Android system. Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp to Ford Motor Co unveiled products featuring Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon that responds to voice commands. Most strikingly, Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co , which manufactures smartphones running on the Android operating system produced by Alphabet Inc's Google, announced that its flagship handset will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States. The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said. Many in the technology industry believe that such voice-powered digital assistants will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way consumers interact with devices. While the shift is only in the early stages, Google must establish a strong presence quickly, particularly on Android devices, to maintain its dominance in internet search, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google's voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that's a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue," he said. Alexa debuted on the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and Amazon is establishing a broad array of hardware and software partnerships around it. The competing Google Assistant launched last year on the company's Pixel smartphone, after appearing on Google's messaging app, and has begun to roll out to third-party devices as well. Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp announced at CES that its Shield television will feature the assistant. While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said. "It highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services," he said. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. While Amazon has a head start, Google is no by no means out of the race, given the strength of its internet search technology. The Google Assistant can already field queries that Alexa cannot, said Sergei Burkov, chief executive of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company. "A huge part of an assistant is search," he said. "Google is a search company. Amazon is not."

As it currently stands, Google Assistant outside of the Allo application requires voice interaction, whereas Google Assistant inside of Allo lets the user type commands, queries and more and Google Assistant will respond back accordingly. The latest version of the Google App Beta contains details that suggest Google may be looking to introduce keyboard support for the Google Assistant core feature so that users can type everything out to interact with it instead of having to speak. While there is no clear indication right now of when Google might introduce this function, a new keyboard icon found within the APK for the Google app beta version 6.1 for the Google Assistant popup points to a possibly near future inclusion of an ability to type interactions. This ability might make using Google Assistant more commonplace for those who don’t care to speak to the digital assistant. In addition to this potential feature, it also looks like Google Assistant for Android Wear might be on the way, as strings of code found in the latest beta APK make references to the Google Assistant settings screen on Android Wear. Google Assistant on Android Wear has been speculated on before but this suggests Google is continuing to work on it, and with Android Wear 2.0’s launch having been pushed back to 2017 instead of launching last year, it’s possible that it could be ready in time for the new version of software. Since the Google app is also for Search and not just an interface for getting access to your personalized Google Now-related content, it makes sense that Google might want to make it as easy as possible to get to Search from just about anywhere. In this latest Google app beta APK, strings of code make reference to “search gestures” which could point to the possibility of being able to quickly access Search through a shortcut by performing a gesture on the home screen. Whether or not this is exactly what Google has planned for search gestures is unclear, but it seems logical to have it implemented for those who have devices where the Google app isn’t readily available via a swipe to the right, i.e. on devices which don’t have the Google or Pixel launchers installed and don’t have search widgets on the home screen. If you’re using the Google app beta and haven’t gotten the latest update, you can pick up the APK from the button down below.

I’m not sure why, but I’ve learned over the years that there is nothing I can do about it. So, frankly, I usually forget about it, and if for some reason I am reminded, I certainly don’t worry about it. It’s a thick skin I developed during my (almost) 50 years working in broadcasting. I’ve found that the best way is to respect and care about the people who respect and care about you, and ignore the rest. That was my philosophy until two months ago, in early November, when my colleague, James, mentioned something that had come to his attention on Google. James is a successful businessman and a generous supporter of The Silver Line, the advice line I launched three years ago to help isolated older people. He explained that someone working for him — a young person who wanted to know more about my career — had Googled my name and been horrified by what he’d uncovered. Directly beneath Wikipedia’s biography of me was the link to a shocking website. It included a lengthy diatribe which, among other lurid allegations, accused me of satanic child abuse, child murder, burying dead babies in my garden, holding drug-fuelled sex parties, covering up the crimes of well-known paedophiles, and creating Childline (the confidential helpline I set up in 1986 which has now helped four-and-a-half million children) as a front organisation whose sole purpose was to filter out accusations of abuse by celebrities. These trolls could have wrecked my charity work  Anyone reading this poisonous filth, the website shrieked with rage, would be astonished that I had not been arrested for all these crimes long ago. No wonder my colleague was deeply concerned when he read it. Not just because of the reputational damage it could do me personally, but because of the real harm it would do to the causes I care about, especially the work I have done with Childline for the past 30 years to protect children from abuse. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next 'Revenge porn victim' files lawsuit against Google, Yahoo!... Facebook blames parents for letting under 13s sign up:... Share this article Share When I read the allegations made on the website, I shrugged it off at first. After all, the claims were so wild, surely no one could possibly take them seriously. But James reminded me that there is a generation of young people — such as his colleague who found this website on Google — who know nothing about my television career, and might think, reading this terrible material in a respected search engine, that there must be some truth in it. It was, after all, the second weblink listed in Google’s search results, and so many of today’s young treat what they read online as gospel . . . So I approached Google, and, using their official complaints procedure, asked them to remove the weblink. After a week, they got back to me. They said they would not remove it. Esther was shocked to find the vicious website attacking her and feared people who didn't know her would believe the lies They said they declined to do anything on the grounds of what they described as my ‘role in public life’ and ‘the public interest’. Instead, they suggested I should take up the matter with the people who created the website and propagated these lies. But, of course, I had no idea who they were. Like so much on the internet, it’s an anonymous website. And, of course, this anonymity encourages the very worst aspects of human nature. The viciousness that used to be restricted to pub gossip or spiteful back-biting has now been provided with a world stage, thanks to modern technology. Psychiatrist Dr Raj Persaud told me that research proves that internet trolls tend to be sadistic, Machiavellian psychopaths. They take pleasure in inflicting pain, they manipulate people and search engines to get the result they want, and feel no remorse about the effects of their actions. And yet, if anyone were to meet these trolls in person, they would often seem timid, meek and diffident. They display their violent cruelty only when they are confident they have a secure hiding place from where they can inflict as much pain as they want — anonymously. After speaking with members of the press office at Google the links were finally removed Only then can they feel powerful, whereas in real life they feel inadequate and impotent. These are people who may well be suffering from serious mental disorders. All the more reason for Google, Twitter and other search engines and social media sites to deny them the oxygen they need to fuel their obsessions, and to take away the audience they crave. Until they do so, these faceless people can continue to take pleasure in inflicting pain and to ‘game the algorithms’, as I’ve learnt it is called, which means finding ways to outwit the mathematical rules that govern the way internet searches work (for instance by adding particular key words to weblink titles). That way, they get their sites to the top of rankings and so reach the widest possible audiences. It is a new battlefield in cyberspace: the trolls against the search engines. In theory, search engines place the links which are considered most useful or popular at the top of the page. Generally, when listing results in order, they also take into consideration many other so-called ‘signals’ — for example, how often the page is updated and if it is from a trust- worthy domain. But in my case the trolls had won. And like many other of their victims, I found myself by mid-November still helpless, appalled that this pernicious website full of evil lies about me continued to be displayed so prominently for the world to see. As a journalist, I know that no newspaper or magazine would ever have published these sick fantasies — claims made without any evidence — because they are such obvious libels. No editor would have considered them for a moment. But the internet prides itself on being the Wild West of Information, where anything goes. No newspaper would print these sick lies about me  And — as we have heard recently — this has led to the proliferation of fake news (such as that Donald Trump was born in Pakistan or that U2’s Bono had been rescued during a terror attack). And is it not ironic that whereas newspapers are increasingly threatened by regulation, the internet remains free from such strictures. Indeed, shockingly, only a dozen of the 2,000 pages in the Leveson report on the Press covered the internet, despite the fact that it is the world’s fastest growing source of news. It did not contain a single recommendation for regulating this vital area, on the grounds — I would say mistaken grounds — that ‘people will not assume that what they read on the internet is trustworthy, or carries any particular assurance or accuracy’. In other words, the more unreliable, unfair and untruthful a news source might be, the less it needed regulating. My personal dilemma aside, this all demonstrates that there are great issues at stake here which governments are failing to address. Surely we deserve better. And for the sake of democracy, rather than worrying about the already regulated Press, surely ministers should be more concerned about the unregulated internet. Not to censor it, but to encourage companies such as Google, Twitter and Facebook to use their common sense and exercise their skills — and their huge incomes — to prevent the trolls from creating a world where there is no distinction between fact and fantasy. As I had no idea who my trolls were, I decided again to approach Google, but through a different route. I reasoned that rather than giving prominent space to sensational lies, surely Google (which incidentally supports both Childline and the NSPCC) must be concerned that by giving such a seemingly authoritative voice to this damaging garbage, countless impressionable people might be swayed by it. Esther celebrates 30 years of Childline, above, which trolls said was a front to filter abuse from celebrities Worst of all, if they believed the lurid accusations, then children might be dissuaded from turning to Childline if they need help. So much for Google’s avowed corporate motto: ‘Don’t be evil’. Having rebuffed me once, this time Google offered me an alternative way to complain: the legal route. I had to fill in a form explaining that the vile material was damaging and untrue, and therefore constituted an offence under the Defamation Act 2013. However, the form was so complicated that I had to ask an expert in the NSPCC for guidance. As the charity runs Childline, and could at once see the potential harm to our crucial work for children, they helped me complete the document. And, at last, there was a result — well, sort of. Google withdrew an article about me — but not the one I’d originally contacted them about. It informed me it had taken down a piece on another less popular site, which it owned, called Blogger. I hadn’t even seen this particular article, but it seems to have copied much of the content from the original lurid piece. So, still, that first article remained, complete with its allegations of satanic abuse, child murder etc, as prominent as ever on Google’s main search listings, directly beneath my entry in Wikipedia. Of course, I am not the only victim. Last month, a journalist for The Observer newspaper discovered that when anyone calls up Google and types in the question ‘Did the Holocaust happen?’, the top-ranking weblink that comes up was an article on a neo-Nazi website entitled ‘Top 10 reasons why the Holocaust didn’t happen’. This shameful, Holocaust-denying material was what Google chose to rank above all other authoritative reports that explain how six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during World War II. Initially, when the journalist brought this to the attention of the search engine’s bosses, they refused to remove it, or alter its results. They disclaimed responsibility by saying: ‘We are saddened to see that hate organisations still exist. The fact that hate sites appear in search results does not mean that Google endorses these views.’ However, after The Observer’s findings were widely reported, Google released a statement saying that it had managed to tweak its algorithm to ‘help surface more high-quality, credible content on the web’. But the episode raises deeply worrying questions. Why do such conspiracy sites manage to manipulate Google’s ranking system in the first place? How do they manage to ‘game the algorithms’ so well? Since The Observer had been successful, and in the hope that publicity might be the only way to fight Google’s intransigence over my case, too, I contacted the Daily Mail about writing an article on this battle. And of course, as a responsible, professional journalist I must then contact Google’s Press Office for a comment. My conversation with them took place at 7.30pm on Wednesday. Within 90 minutes, the disgraceful weblink — about which Google had previously done nothing — was taken down. But, of course, I am in a privileged position. It shouldn’t be that fear of being exposed in a national newspaper should force a climbdown. Google should have done so of its own accord, without any pressure. When I asked Google why it had taken so long to remove such obvious, lurid defamation, it admitted that some of their systems had not worked as they should. I was told: ‘Our goal is to help people find the huge amount of information that is available on the web, but we do remove content from our results in response to valid legal requests — for example, when a page contains defamatory material. We work hard to provide high-quality and accurate results for searches, but judging which pages on the web best answer a query is a challenging problem, and we don’t always get it right. ‘We’re constantly updating our algorithms to improve the quality of our search results.’ If I had not had the Mail on my side, there’s no doubt in my mind that the disgusting libel would still be there for all to see — with all its power to damage Childline’s invaluable work. But not everyone is in my privileged position. The fact is that Google, Twitter and all those who claim to be doing mankind a service by offering a liberating platform for the complete spectrum of our opinions, hopes and fears, are disgracefully failing in what ought to be their duty. Namely, to protect us from the worst excesses of human nature. The Bible says in the Ninth Commandment: ‘Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.’ And the Eleventh should now read: ‘And thou shalt not allow people to tell wicked, damaging lies in cyberspace.’   Share or comment on this article e-mail 561 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

Hey Alexa, what are your competitors doing? Amazon's assistant has taken an early lead in product integrations. Can others catch up? Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 07 January, 2017 11:55 - - - - print email Comments Internet-connected intelligent gizmos had a big showing at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, and there is one common thread between many ofthem: Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant. Lenovo has a new speaker featuring the assistant. Volkswagen and Ford are building Alexa into their cars. Plus, there’s a whole flotilla of other connected devices featuring Alexa, including a high-tech refrigerator from LG. That’s not to say other virtual assistants aren’t doing the same thing, but Amazon is the clear winner by volume at CES. So, what does that mean for the virtual assistant market, which includes competitors such as Microsoft's Cortana, the Google Assistant and Apple's Siri? Those companies need to start doing the same things Amazon has done, Gartner Research Director Werner Goertz said. There's still room to compete, in part because Amazon’s dominance doesn’t extend beyond the connected home, Goertz said in an interview. “But, the longer the other guys wait -- specifically, the longer Cortana and Siri wait -- the more insurmountable this obstacle is going to become,” he said. One of Alexa's key advantages is that Amazon released the software development kits to create Alexa-integrated hardware in the middle of last year. That gave device manufacturers plenty of time to build their products in time for an announcement at CES. Some of Amazon’s competitors took different approaches. Microsoft and Google each announced integration tools for their assistants later in the year and have kept third-party integrations available to consumers limited to a small number of partners. Amazon's early move helped it land the deal with Volkswagen, for example. A representative for the carmaker at its booth at CES called out Amazon’s early move with SDKs as a key reason for implementing it instead of something like the Google Assistant. Another reason Amazon may have such a lead is that the Echo can serve as a smart-home hub without requiring gadget manufacturers to work directly with one another. From Microsoft’s perspective, Amazon’s lead in numbers is at least somewhat by design. Ryan Gavin, the general manager for search and Cortana, said in an interview that the company doesn’t see this as a race to get the most integrations. Instead, Microsoft wants to promote integrations that fit Cortana's mission of improving productivity. But that’s almost what you’d expect the company to say, considering that Amazon is far ahead of them with the number of connected devices available for its assistant. Google could have been in Amazon's position but got lost in the weeds with Nest, the smart-home hardware company it acquired in 2014, said Patrick Moorhead, the president and principal analyst for Moor Insights and Strategy. “Microsoft had more important things to work out, like other AI implementations,” he said in an email. “Cortana is world class, but doesn't have a smart-home ecosystem to control. That is changing, of course.” It’s worth noting that Amazon still has a long way to go when it comes to attracting users of Alexa. The Echo is only available in the U.S., which is an incredibly small user base compared with the 37 countries where Siri is available. That’s not to say Amazon won’t be expanding its virtual assistant's horizons, but just that its worldwide dominance is not assured. And it will have no shortage of competitors. LG and Sony each showed off their own virtual assistants at CES, while Microsoft and Google are hardly standing still. For example, Moorhead expects Microsoft and Google to take the lead in making virtual assistants for PCs, smartphones and tablets. It will be interesting to see how these virtual-assistant ecosystems shake out. Right now, each player has its own home base: Siri on the iPhone, Cortana on the PC, Google on its hardware and Alexa on the Echo. Over the next few years, it seems likely that they’ll try to cement their presence on other platforms.

Many never make it to store shelves, but it's a great way to see how technology will evolve over the coming year. Here's what you can expect in 2017 based on what we saw from CES. Photo by aj-clicks. Alexa and Google Assistant Will Infiltrate Everything The Amazon Echo was a surprising hit when it first came out, but last year Google turned up the competition by launching Google Assistant and putting it inside its own smart speaker, the Google Home. This year at CES, the gloves came off. Google and Amazon are racing to integrate their smart assistants with every gadget in your life. So far, Amazon is winning. Soon, people will be able to buy a huge array of non-Amazon devices with Alexa built-in, including a $US140 ($192) speaker from Lenovo, several off-brand 4K TVs, a TRON-like lamp from GE, Ford cars and a weird robot from LG among countless others. If there's a device left in your home that Amazon hasn't put Alexa on, the company at least wants to control it with Alexa commands. People will soon be able to control Samsung's robot vacuum, DISH's Hopper DVR and Whirlpool's washers, dryers, refrigerators and ovens with just your voice. You know, assuming you have an Echo in 10 years when you finally get around to upgrading your refrigerator. (You might if it takes that long for the Echo to officially hit Australia.) Google showed off a smaller version of the same game plan. Google Assistant is coming to Android TV, including a new version of the NVIDIA SHIELD TV (and we were already impressed with the old version). Android TV already supports Google's voice commands, but this will allow you to issue commands using "OK, Google" as long as the remote control can hear you, even if you don't press a button first. All of this points to one very push in 2017: Smart assistants will be everywhere. Amazon and, to a lesser extent, Google want you to view Alexa and Google as a virtual person that's in every room with you. Just speak out loud and they can help you with everything you need to do. It's an ambitious plan, but it probably has a long way to go before it's reality yet. TVs are Getting Super Thin, and There's a New Video Format War Brewing In 2016, 4K TVs started to hit the mainstream. While they're cheap and common enough to look at if you're already upgrading, the real future of television (and video) is HDR. HDR offers a better overall picture, a wider range of colours and higher contrast than typical sets. This year, TV manufacturers switched their hype machines from 4K to HDR. LG, for example, announced a new lineup of TVs that will include support for all four flavours of HDR. If you read that and thought, "There are four HDR formats?" the answer is yes, but don't panic. Most TVs support one of the two main specs — HDR10 and Dolby Vision — and both are great upgrades over regular 4K video. The two newer specs — Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) and Advanced HDR (also called SL-HDR1) are aimed at broadcast video, so they won't impact your favourite movies and TV shows too much, but it will matter if you watch sports or live TV. Luckily, TVs can support multiple formats at once. Buying a set that supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision will make cover most of the media you watch, but HDR10 is plenty for almost everything you'll need. If you really want to make sure you get the best bang for your buck, wait to buy a new TV until sets that support all four specs come down in price. You'll hear a lot more about HDR from manufacturers this year, but it might be worth waiting until the 2017 holiday season at least to buy a new set. Alternatively, if you want last year's TVs for a great deal, you can also shop around during Super Bowl season. If HDR isn't enough to open your wallet, manufacturers like LG and Samsung are hoping that they can tempt you with TVs that blend into your living room's decor. LG's new W7 model, nicknamed the "Wallpaper TV" is just 3.85mm thick. It stores most of its electronics in a sound bar beneath the TV. Meanwhile, Samsung showed off a super thin TV disguised as a painting. When you're not watching it, the TV will display artwork rather than turning off entirely. It's like something out of Back to the Future. Chromecasts and set-top boxes already display rotating images when idle, but Samsung's Lifestyle TV treats your set like it's just another decoration in your living room. If you're the type to hide a massive screen in a cabinet, or don't like the look of a home theatre in your living room, this trend towards incognito TVs might interest you. NVIDIA Is Bringing Game Streaming to Windows and Macs Ever since OnLive died a grisly death, NVIDIA has been trying to get in-home game streaming off the ground. In 2015, the company launched the SHIELD TV, which impressed us when we tried it, that could stream PC games to your TV, so you could play your favourite PC titles while sitting on your couch. The service seemed pretty cool, but you still had to shell out $US200 ($274) for the box, which is a hard sell in a world of $90 Steam Link boxes. This year, NVIDIA announced it will bring the same service the SHIELD offers to any PC and Mac with GeForce Now. This is a huge deal because now it's possible to play high-end PC games even if your computer doesn't meet the system requirements. You can choose to play on either a GTX 1060 or GTX 1080-powered PC and stream the game's video back to your computer. Windows users can play games that their computers aren't powerful enough to handle. Mac users can play games that are Windows-exclusive. It's a great option for everyone. Of course, that comes at a price. GeForce Now will cost $US25 ($34) for 20 hours on the 1060 or 10 hours on the 1080. You also have to bring your own game library. You can download Steam, GOG, Origin and Battle.net games from your existing library; install them on the remote machine and play them on the more powerful hardware. If you want to play a game you don't own, you'll have to buy it from their respective stores first, then pay by the hour to play it. This is much different from how GeForce Now works on the SHIELD TV. There, you pay a flat $US8 ($11)/month to access a library of games you can stream and play with the SHIELD controller (some games cost more). Bottom line, if you want to casually play games on your couch, get the new SHIELD TV and pay a subscription fee. If you want to play games on your computer with a keyboard and mouse, you'll be able to download GeForce Now soon. 'Smart' Gadget Companies Are Bored As Hell CES is a great glimpse at what the tech world will look like for the year. It's also a parade of some of the oddest or most eclectic ideas we've ever seen. This year, the tradition of inexplicable or niche gadgets shows no sign of slowing. Smart Fridges are Still a Thing LG and Samsung keep cranking out new refrigerators with giant tablets in their doors for some reason. The newest ones run Windows or Android. While the concept of tracking if your food has gone bad is cool, having to patch, update or worry about security fixes for your fridge is not. Keep in mind that refrigerators should last around 15 years. Meanwhile, Windows 7, released in 2009, will lose extended support by 2020. Who knows what version of Android Google will support 15 years from now. If you buy a smart fridge today, you can expect that it will be buggy and outdated for most of its lifespan, and inevitably join a botnet and participate in a massive DDoS attack. Toast Is Complicated So This Smart Toaster Remembers Things For You If you've ever accidentally burned a piece of toast, you probably grumbled a little bit to yourself, scraped the burnt part off and promised to turn the dial down next time. Now, thanks to this Griffin smart toaster ($US100 [$137]), you can fiddle with your phone and struggle with tweaking your toaster's Bluetooth settings instead. Your toast will still probably burn, but at least you'll have data to explain why. This Is A $165 Sticky Note Printer This device will let you write notes on your phone, then print them out on sticky notes. It costs $US120 ($165). Alternatively, here are 400 sticky notes for $12 and 12 pens for $5. Those are the big trends we saw, but CES is still going on throughout the weekend.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking By Julia Love Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) digital assistant appeared almost everywhere at the CES technology show this week in Las Vegas, even making an unexpected appearance on rival Google’s Android system. Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) to Ford Motor Co (F.N) unveiled products featuring Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon that responds to voice commands. Most strikingly, Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL], which manufactures smartphones running on the Android operating system produced by Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, announced that its flagship handset will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States. The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said. Many in the technology industry believe that such voice-powered digital assistants will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way consumers interact with devices. While the shift is only in the early stages, Google must establish a strong presence quickly, particularly on Android devices, to maintain its dominance in internet search, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “To the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Google’s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, that’s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence), and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue,” he said. Alexa debuted on the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and Amazon is establishing a broad array of hardware and software partnerships around it. The competing Google Assistant launched last year on the company’s Pixel smartphone, after appearing on Google's messaging app, and has begun to roll out to third-party devices as well. Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) announced at CES that its Shield television will feature the assistant. While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said. “It highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services,” he said. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. While Amazon has a head start, Google is no by no means out of the race, given the strength of its internet search technology. The Google Assistant can already field queries that Alexa cannot, said Sergei Burkov, chief executive of Alterra.ai, an artificial intelligence company. “A huge part of an assistant is search,” he said. “Google is a search company. Amazon is not.” (Reporting by Julia Love in Las Vegas; Editing by Bill Rigby) Next In Money News Davos elites struggle for answers as Trump era dawns DAVOS, Switzerland The global economy is in better shape than it's been in years.

About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Menu About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Search advertisement Homepage » Hardware & Software » Why I uninstalled Microsoft Office from my computer Why I uninstalled Microsoft Office from my computer Posted 6 Jan 2017 by Garikai Dzoma (@gdzoma) Read 18 Comments Truth be told I sort of tolerate the Windows Operating system for various reasons including the fact that it has better multimedia driver support and most accessories have plug and play support, while in my beloved Ubuntu I might have to go into the terminal to figure things out. Most importantly it’s the only way I can use Microsoft Office without having to pay Bill every other month. In the old days, all I had to do was buy a new laptop flip the lid, remove crapware that comes preloaded, install an antivirus and then I was good to go. Now things are decidedly different. I had to struggle to gain limited control on how I received my updates. Removing some of the useless applications like MSN Sports and other useless bandwidth hogging parts was unnecessarily hard. Office, it seems, is no longer preactivated To top all that off it seems the preinstalled version of Office that came with the laptop was not even activated! And that is where the trouble began. A tale of confusing licences Since I have sworn off pirated software I decided to find out how much it would cost me to get a licence. The array of licences available is mind-numbing and confusing. There are SPLA, FFP, OEM (I knew was not looking for this right away), USL and of course Volume Licensing where I have to pay Bill every month/year. advertisement After deciding I didn’t really want to spend an eye-popping $290 – families live off that kind of money- to buy glorified text editor I decided to have a look at volume licensing which looked cheaper. Only to be confronted by another endless iteration of options and tables. Later I discovered I had to pay $99 a year for the trouble of having One Note on my desktop. Then it got me thinking. Do I really need Office anymore? Do you really need Office? Like I said above there was a time when Ms Office was the mainstay of every office big and small. Google Docs was not even considered an alternative, it was clunky, lacked essential features, terrorised Internet Explorer and stretched it to its limits, required a very good internet connection and produced documents that were not exactly compatible. That was then. Now, Google Docs is a rival that Ms Office products have to contend with. While for nostalgic reasons people still tend to stick to Ms Office I don’t think the experience is worth the $99 a year experience. Add the fact that sometimes I just want to work from any device without being shackled by the fact that the demi-gods at Microsoft could not be bothered to port Office to it, Google Docs became a viable alternative. The last straw was when the Office Update Utility started chewing through my limited bandwidth in the middle of the day rendering my connection unusable. So I said no to Microsoft and decided to avail to Google one more facet of my life. Now the damn thing knows where I stay, the weather, what I look like, where I have been and just about everything else. Creepily it tells me when it’s time to go to work and alerts me when my secret football team is taking a thrashing. Getting some new love Prior to this change, I had only used Google Docs occasionally. While it takes time to get used to the interface the experience is not unpleasant. One feature that takes some getting used to is the autosave feature. You type something and it is saved almost instantly without hitting Ctrl + S. If you feign a British or American accent then there is voice typing to give your fingers a rest but it seems for all its omniscience Google still struggles to spell Tapiwa. You also get access to common fonts such as Calibri plus the shipload of Google’s famous web safe fonts. A word of warning using these fonts would require the person to whom you are sending the document to, to download the fonts if they are using an offline document viewer such as Ms Office 2013 to view the document properly. The interface is uncluttered and distraction free allowing your to focus on the task at hand. You can also Google search to include links or find the meanings of various words, use a thesaurus and most importantly share and collaborate with others with ease. I am sure Ms Office’s cloud offerings have features to match these and to be fair but Google Docs comes with free 15 GB storage and if I want a paid version I have to pay $5 a month without going through a licensing ballet. I don’t even have to think about back-ups anymore. You can also extend Google Docs using many of the offered add-ons. For the first time, I can spell the word café the way it’s supposed to be spelt without going through hoops. Don’t believe me? Try spelling MØ in Word. The internet catch One serious drawback of using Google Drive is that you need a constant and decent internet connection otherwise you will go bald as you constantly pull out your hair in frustration. Sure you can edit a document offline for a while but the suit is supposed to be used online. A counter-argument can be made that Ms Office requires regular large updates to be downloaded and applied which means an internet connection would still be required but it will not stop working even if you don’t update it so. Also while their version of Excel (it’s really called a spreadsheet) is decent when it comes to advanced features it’s just crap. It cannot even properly import CVS files generated by Google themselves which is pretty embarrassing. You could also check LibreOffice LibreOffice is touted as a FOSS Ms Office alternative. Personally, I don’t believe that at all. I personally detest it myself but some people swear by it. So if you do not have a constant internet connection you can try that route. Stay away from OpenOffice while you are at it. It receives less frequent updates and I can predict its ultimate demise in the next coming months or years. Last words To be clear I did not uninstall Office because it was terrible, it just that for me, and I would guess for most people, there is really no compelling reason to choose it above its competitors anymore. That, plus Google Docs is pretty awesome you should give it a try. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Google, Microsoft Office, office 365 Previous Post « Some light at the end of the tunnel for local gamers. Next post Social media wins again – Stunner & Olinda “drama” shows dominance of online content » 18 Comments EMC says: January 6, 2017 at 11:06 AM For what you do, Notepad is probably enough so MS Office is overkill. Notepad++ and you’re in heaven. This ‘Everybody Hates Microsoft’ mantra is getting old. We all know the alternatives are all trying to replicate Windows and MS Office with laughable results. We use Google for Business in our company for email and storage requirements, and we get all sorts of issues with missing files, failed syncs, you-name-it. We miss the features of Outlook and Google deliberately killed compatibility with Outlook for their enterprise email service. The truth of the matter is the world runs on Windows and Microsoft deserves some credit for that Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 11:23 AM Read again slowly this time. My uninstalling Office has nothing to do with hating Microsoft. I run bash in Windows! I and a lot of ppl cannot afford it Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:01 PM PS: Volume Licensing From my experience with Volume Licensing, its is just a term most usually for organisations whereby an organisation requires multiple licenses of the Microsoft product eg the MS Office, but they do not require multiple copies of the installation media. It is cheap in the sense that you get only 1 DVD but your license can have the number of activations or seats that you require e.g for 50 users. That is how the cheapness comes about in that they do not need to ship to you 50 DVDs. What you are actually referring to as having to pay a bill every month if I am not mistaken is Office365. Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:05 PM For MS Office Licenses, the licenses are perpertual and what you expires every 24 months is the Software Assurance which gives you the ability to upgrade to a new version if Microsoft brings in a new version of the software and your Software Assurance is still valid. Yes Microsoft licensing is confusing Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 12:38 PM Thanks Tsenny and EMC. Sometimes I feel the articles on TECHZim, while aimed at addressing some tech issue, lack sufficient investigation that would make them more informative. They end up sounding like posts on a personal blog where there is no editorial moderation. And for some of us, being non-core techies, we will be hoping to read insightful articles on tech as it affects us, how we can make it easier to use, general news, etc. Like how Tsenny just described MS Office licensing in 2 short paragraphs, leaving me with sufficient detail that at least the amount I spend will be once off, but the licensing is confusing. And to the writer, from a PR point of view, “never tell a person who has taken the time to read your writing that they should “read again more slowly this time”. It’s rude. I am saying this from the point of view of both a writer, reader and consumer. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:10 PM Sigh, I apologize for being insensitive, too much time at Stack Exchange and hacker forums where you speak your mind next time I will buy a candle and we will hug it out. I am not speaking for the editor but when I write, and for most tech blogs like ZDNet, Techcrunch, Wired and a gazillion others out there, each writer has his/her little nook and cranny. We know for example that Ernesto from torrentfreak hates the DCMA, Joey from OMGUbuntu loves his cat etc it’s just how it is. I cannot, and will never write about something that I don’t know. I will never even pretend to be unbiased, that is a Western media fiction just compare Fox News and ABC for example and you will know there is never such a thing as a balanced opinion. The point of the article was Ms Office licensing is expensive and stupid compared to how they used to do it. The caustic remark was meant to point out the fact that I was talking about Word Processing and the comment is telling me to use Notepad ! and Notepad++. For the record I use Sublime Text and Atom whenever I need a text editor. Now I will admit I have done it myself countless times: I see the title and scroll down to the comment section to leave a comment without even reading the article. Reply surur says: January 6, 2017 at 7:16 PM The licensing is only confusing because Garikai was looking for a work around to paying full price. For consumers there are really only two options – 1) pay full price for the boxed copy or 2) pay for Office 365 Home. All the other licensing models are for schools and businesses or PC builders, and are not intended for regular consumers. This is the same ridiculous complaint we see about there being 11 versions of Windows . Windows Server is not for granny at home. She either gets Windows with her PC, buys a boxed copy in the store (where there will only be Pro and Home) or purchase an upgrade from the online store, where there will only be Pro and Home. Reply TheKing says: January 6, 2017 at 12:50 PM WPS is the best Microsoft Office alternative for Linux. WPS Writer matches or is actually better than Word. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM No argument here. It’s just I cannot afford it anymore. Reply Lennon says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM I am selling Microsoft Office 2016 Pro Plus activation key only for $35. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 2:26 PM I have read this and as someone who buys MS Office (Full Pro) almost every month, l can say this is not clearly explained, its a mixed bag of ideas. We need to clearly distinguish which office we are talking about! Is it online office or offline office. Its a rule, if you are using SaaS, the features are limited compared to offline. One such SaaS is MS Office 365. Licensing can be cheap because you can rent it when you need it, and stop when you do not want it. I have both Libre Office and MS Pro on my PC, l still believe Libre is the easier no brainer replacement for MS offline installations. Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 3:38 PM Exactly my point.. the original article is going everywhere else except somewhere specific. Have found more insight from the comments section than the original article. That being said, being a technocrat in an area and supping with the Techcrunch, Google or any of those big guys does not make one a good article writer. One should invest time in learning how to write effectively. Reply NdiniNdadaro says: January 6, 2017 at 2:55 PM I use cracked version much like Rhodes took the land without paying. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 3:30 PM cracked version on works for offline usage, the day it will call home is the day you will kiss it goodbye Reply Tom says: January 7, 2017 at 2:29 AM TechZim, your articles are becoming poorer and poorer by the day. Everytime i read ur articles since u decided to diversify from being a tech only site i am disappointed. Guys u r putting too much off ur emotions and little research in the topic at hand. Your articles are now more of click bait than informative. What have i learned from your article? i hv learned that u dont like that Microsoft dorminates the word editor space. while its ur opinion u didnt fully research on how to get a licence to use Office and which type of user each license suits , u just complained how u dont want to pay money to use Office. this article is good for a teenage blog not a site which aims to inform people. In a nutshell, too much self opinion less facts (this has bn happening for some time ) Reply peterc says: January 7, 2017 at 9:37 AM LibreOffice user here. Not the best thing since sliced bread but it solves most of my problems. Reply Joe says: January 8, 2017 at 10:17 AM I’ve been using Google docs extensively over the last few years. But here is one simple example of many as to why you should not get rid of word and rely solely on Google docs. Write a simple 5 page document in Google docs. Now go to page 3 of the document and start page numbering on that page instead. You won’t be able to. Google states it. There are several simple things like that are missing in docs that is infuriating. I always end up going back to word.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Are you human or a bot? Google’s invisible reCAPTCHA will decide 06 Dec 2016 0 Botnet, Google, Security threats Post navigation Previous: How to guess credit card security codes Next: Rogue admin jailed after taking down former employer’s network by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit A few years ago, Google simplified its prove-you’re-a-human reCAPTCHA test. To prove we’re not automated bots, it gave us a single, hopefully quivery “I’m not a robot” click to replace the previous deciphering of blobby melted characters and mathematical problems that made our brains hurt. Google: So much simpler! Our readers: MAKE IT STOP!!! Carol February 12, 2016 at 10:02 pm for days now every post I share on Facebook has that stupid test, and i’m ready to delete Facebook all together. I’ve had it, I shouldn’t have to prove i’m not a robot!!!!! over and over and over again, I’m at #4 test so far today and have over 15 yesterday and not sure how many the day before, I’M SICK OF IT!!! HOW DO I STOP IT!!!!! nope September 24, 2016 at 9:10 pm they can f off and die with this cr@p tired of I the user having to prove anything Now, Google is making it stop. Coming “soon” (hopefully) to a now-annoying site near you is Google’s Invisible reCAPTCHA: a free service designed to protect sites and apps from spam and abuse without any need for users to click in a quivery human fashion, select all the kitten pictures or whatever other thing developers have had us do to prove we’re real. Google says on its developer signup page that Invisible reCAPTCHA will use advanced risk analysis technology to separate humans from bots: no need for us to click on anything at all (or to select images associated with a clue image, as mobile users have been doing). Proving you’re human can be tiresome, but it’s certainly worth blocking bots, which never get bored. Nor do they tire of running through the automated nastiness they do. Bots harvest email addresses from contact or guestbook pages, scrape sites and reuse the content without permission on automatically generated doorway pages, take part in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and automatically try to log into sites with reused passwords ripped off from breaches. One such: the recent password-reuse attack on the UK’s National Lottery. Google’s been using risk analysis to fend off bots for years. In 2013, it revealed what it called its Advanced Risk Analysis backend for reCAPTCHA. That back end doesn’t just look at whatever gobbledygook we type into a box or how human-like our mouse clicks are. Rather, it observes our entire engagement with a CAPTCHA, from start to finish – before, during, and after we click anything – to determine whether we’re carbon-based. Specifically, the difference between bot and human can be revealed in clues as subtle as how a user (or a bot) moves a mouse in the brief moments before clicking the “I am not a robot” button, according to Vinay Shet, the product manager for Google’s Captcha team. Without realizing it, humans also drop clues that can establish whether we’re automated or not: IP addresses and cookies show our movements elsewhere on the web and can help prove that we’re not a bad actor. Regardless, reCAPTCHA hasn’t proved infallible, at least as far as the test for image selection goes. In April, a trio of Columbia University researchers managed to figure out how to speed up the rate at which they could try new CAPTCHAs, guess how the CAPTCHA process works behind the scenes in order to game the system, and use other online services to automatically solve CAPTCHAs  faster than the designers thought possible. The new Invisible reCAPTCHA will mean that Google’s submerging its bot/human detection technology completely. Bots presumably won’t be able to game the system by doing what those researchers did: to (ironically enough!) use Google image search to come up with a list of words associated with given images and thus automate the click-all-the-kitties tests. For those of us who’ve been tearing our hair out over, say, Craigslist’s overuse of reCAPTCHA, invisible culling of humans-vs-bots is likely going to be very welcome indeed. For those who loathe and distrust the notion of Google silently lurking beneath the surface, tracking our mouse clicks and our cursor movements to see which ads we like best a la what Facebook has mulled doing, no, this won’t seem like a good move at all. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More There’s nothing unique about Google’s ability to track our mouse movements and analyze our behavior on web sites, of course. Facebook, Twitter, or any webpage can track everything you do and could be keylogging your every pointer movement or keystroke. Logging keystrokes is no super-secret, privacy-sucking trick. It’s plain old Web 1.0. This isn’t news, but it’s certainly worth repeating: anybody with a website can capture what you type, as you type it, if they want to. If you want to see that tracking in live action as you visit a site, ClickClickClick is a lot of fun. The site doesn’t just track you, it gives you a running commentary about its tracking of you, replete with amusing analysis of why you’re doing what you’re doing. The reality is that JavaScript, the language that makes this kind of monitoring possible, is both powerful and ubiquitous. It’s a fully featured programming language that can be embedded in web pages, and all browsers support it. It enables tracking of cursor position, of our keystrokes and call “home” without refreshing the page or making any kind of visual display. Those aren’t intrinsically bad things. In fact, they’re enormously useful. Without those sort of capabilities sites like Facebook and Gmail would be almost unusable, searches wouldn’t auto-suggest and Google Docs wouldn’t save our bacon in the background. In the case of Google’s continuing advances with reCAPTCHA, such an ability can stop a lot of bad bots from doing things that can be worse than the annoyance of having to endure typing in text from a blobby image. But does it have to be Google who’s doing it? Some people on Twitter would prefer it wasn’t. Anonymity and privacy researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis noted that bots aren’t all bad. Some can be useful, crawling the web for information – the type that isn’t used for nefarious purposes. But she wishes that Google weren’t the one calling the shots: I’d <3 a future where smart bots crawl for useful info & report back – I’d really like those bots to not to have to be licensed by Google. — Sarah Jamie Lewis (@SarahJamieLewis) December 5, 2016 Follow @NakedSecurity Follow @LisaVaas bots Google Invisible reCAPTCHA No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA password reuse reCAPTCHA Free tools Sophos Home for Windows and Mac XG Firewall Home Edition Mobile Security for Android Virus Removal Tool Antivirus for Linux Post navigation Previous: How to guess credit card security codes Next: Rogue admin jailed after taking down former employer’s network About the author Lisa Vaas I've been writing about technology, careers, science and health since 1995.

If NATO brought app and are you happy new man so I don't know if you want again this I just remembered this beats Omega. Really went overboard. A bit too much injury what I mean is it. I have it in a way everyone has their there when downfall mine is fire ball. Fireball shots as quite a few of them yeah that's a salacious and sealed. And you combine that with the you know a year you with your friends you Danson year. You know you have to sit there for the night it it it just now with the kids you know all the apps that you just route the center that was over the baby sitter for the in and but we have that the wife and I had a blast and I'd just drank way too much to the point where. New Year's Eve the clock winding down my voice a conforming I'm an companion RP yeah I think it is the legacy I mean I think it was a you're looking. But also drug campaign dope you can I do and it took like three minutes so at. Missed time that you own is still better them right here so guys struggle in the that we have interesting series of shows you're going to be Bulent. You know his play out season here knowing that and we've gotten way used to the patriots lose and things count points and we used him we've gotten very used to the patriots. Being in the position there in. Right now the top 110 two CD's you're the one. And so we really wanted to kind of take. Our historical. Professor. Like jobs here at W yeah I seriously in kind of inform everyone as a reminder of what. The history of the patriots in the playoffs looks like we're gonna go the way back machine we're gonna go mr. Peabody and Sherman here is precisely chairman. William. It's a regular go visit names late so he's and then. In Garin Veres and only a fantastic level this so come with us if you will we're gonna start this week and efforts. A series of show's going to be on kind of the history of the pitchers in the wild card round now fortunately. For us we don't have to deal with the way out there around the here's the pats beat them once eaten by that's child's play now and yeah that's it's really kind of like those. You know the first first few months the school where you know he does that's his organized basketball right into the does the ads in the finals there's a we are I just started by just kind of talking about the wild card and while our first season. Of while cart football in the playoff format. Actually started seven need to look at okay which is typical because it completely screwed patriots. On the the pats now have won their first ever division seven. And amazingly enough. Did lead the league decides to do it at a wild card round and so the patriots do get abided in the have to face Houston. In their home game and they end up you know even though we're gonna talk more about that next week we going to do the division series ride in the history there they get blown out of home. By those that fantastic Houston Oilers. And I was 31 of fourteen blah but you know so it is the wild card round doesn't exist. We don't have to play that game against Houston the patriots at the time had set the NFL record for. Rushing by team which still stands but really that's that it actually Russian in 1970. Eight season. For 3165. Yards is a team and get this rating. So they have four guys over 500 yards rushing but nobody over a thousand yards to the thousand yard rusher. But yet they still says that the team record in 78 it did against the stance today. So those facilities members Sam bam Cunningham I mean still so great. You know included in the Adam Sandler son back once and that was good that. 768 yards all mutton chops Andy Johnson got a good look guys job yes is great seventies haircut. 675. Yards course ivory who probably has the best mustache have you ever won a look at this in the best day Horace I area I mean that's brilliant yeah it out of his mustache that you won't believe.

He had 539 as a quarterback we just get a at the time was like you know nobody ran out of her though right that's Randall Cunningham numbers I mean certainly not Michael Vick numbers. You know so he blundered or later I mean so they had this incredible running game Texas senate NFL record for rushing first down 180 one's. It's also still stands. I'm talking a first down re running so like to think about all the guys that go third and longs third ministered Nat. It's got a lot of first downs and as he's running and talked about utilizing. A multi back. Back fields you know four different options there on the run I mean this year. I was shocked that we used three different options and the role with James White the analysts and of course LG. And then you know Brady's not exactly tearing down. That breaking now easing in bulk records. It Jane chuck Fairbanks is the head coach that time chuck Fairbanks and it will get into next week I'll get the disaster that game and everything else that hasn't registered I just thought it was worth the mansion. That's always a wild card starts the year of the pig is that when an altar embassies. But actual first wildcard matchup is back way back in 1982. All right young five year old uncle buck's a sign up for an televisions. After attending the game earlier in the year. As a five year old mind you in which this the snowplow comes out in the patriots got the three nothing win the John Smith field goal. That was a while Miami you know I'll created a listen to the snowplow game. So I bring that went up because. 1982 we're gonna go back to January 8. A 1983. Make the plants and they're going up against the seven and two. Miami Dolphins at the Orange Bowl who are livid. Because of the patriots three nothing sort earlier in the season. What could cracked me about this when his. On first of all let's talk what plants story that time because the strike shortened season. Did the NFL decided to basically up different type of turn to there's eight teams involved in this tournament that of the five used to be okay. ASEAN CB fighting due to ten total it eighteens for Eads. Conference so the patriots are the seventh seed and it eight. Okay they're the face the number two seed dolphins. In the 53 degree after 24 degree weather the original. Don Shula. Had met Pete Rose L week after the he remember the whole. Story about the snow plow right yes yes of course Mark Anderson. Work work release guys from my MCI nor folk right. You member of their the plug the open spot check yet you remember who the gap most. Notorious. Incarcerate beer. A prisoner of that. Jail was prior to mr. Anderson. Now I would look at Malcolm X was. Marketers and plows the the field we'll swap that allows for the Johnson with Google patriots win. I Don Shula and the commission competition committee actually goes and meets with Pete is now he is Al Ras Al says. Right patriots cheated with a burst on. A eight bit jaded as something illegal you know what he'd said I've never overturned a game. At this point not restart now. I'd be the only time we actually definitively prove that they treat every day and you know that's. It's is that worse than deflating for balls just being generally aware of I'll have to be. But nick is fantastic levity fits perfectly into our sports city for the dolphins as the is there remains game. 3 December 12 that says it's up with the plug and now passed Borg raid. And through the dolphins. It's. It was a it was a when need that their team undated patriots highlight was dot passed back yes either of those of salmon darlings. And Matt Hasselbeck. Twenty yard touchdown Steve and that's really. A billionaire. Heat of the go back and watch it's funny that you can find the opening of that team. Which Bob Kostis. Talk about controversy of these you know patriots. And it's very it's very cute very funny to mr. Costas nobody seems we take series they played and does. So. Everything else and a India and no one's I I look forward to that except for the playoffs and it adds. So yes the patriots go out and blow their first that offers the wildcard. And and have another wild card game it's real three years later the dream season the dreams he's yeah this is like the closest thing to you know impossible dream patriots it would we will lies that was so which argument 95 wild card. Game game's actually on December 28. It's five patriots in the New York Jets at Giants Stadium the forests. First game plant to be held urgency and right is a major win. It and we wrote Tony Franklin's bare foot. While the with its victory. Bothered me the negative ones you did I met him and I said demise it well I was at my kids in the semester break and doesn't hurt that year. You know she often kicking nine better accuracy of this thing happening in enemies in action that was strangest thing like but the I can't imagine you would get feel like you get better accuracy whatever. And I've been hit series the stuff news. Put into like smaller issue by. Yeah well and he said you know one and games where they've played this now actually memory and kicking with that. It's a lot in this game he it and ticket and then he basically wouldn't cover the kick is one back of the size companies that argument. So anyway that the five wild card patriots have agreement buried. As their. Coach. We're talking about that thing going and his team with the battle and it's through draft class rate Tonys and it was the fifteenth overall pick by the patriots. Nurses can O'Brien video cameos 24 pick by the jets and he's ever wondered what's the that yet video went east into Marino. They're the third was related to but if you just watch its opening date. Compiled Eisley who YouTube all the jet draft. Wonders and as the great one that you know obviously did jet's nose up that we don't. Because they both passed on from bingo later told him. So EC at O'Brien. O'Brien supposedly suffered a concussion the first quarter but like today. He has replaced in the third quarter we care about concussions and 85 kids via pats defense. At a four turnover game absolutely. Annihilated the jets' offense. O'Brien was sacked five times Alfred Marietta picked the senate he's dispersed field goal. A sorry Franklin I'm sorry. Know Fred married it picked the senate. Tony Eason. Who threw two 36 yard touchdown passes dealings and Morgan and then you know was can't count offering her thirteen separate half. I'm Tony remembered. Strip strip sack into the end zone touchdown. A special team a gap in so the patriots are opera running right so they go on and Pat O'Brien another one from the the graveyard of Jack quarterbacks comes in and there are places count when he exit doors for touchdown pass by. He does get picked up again mayors and set up field with the right final score 2614. Pets Darren Veres with three sacks and an interception what was the last time a patriot of the three sack game. You know maybe Chandler Jones a couple years ago so yeah I would think back to McGinest you know if it Willie McGinest absolutely implants anyway. But he had no so that was a Pat's first lap car went in and of course our fanatical and Oakland Morgan and more to that next week to a but they go to Oakland and they go to Miami two more road wins and more off running as of bolt when he. It was gonna stop us now no one noble Nolan though so we'll let you tune in later we Italy will need that game I was thinking. Nine years old well now. So now we really get a password because the pats don't make it to the wild card game series at make it. They made the playoffs the following year but again they don't ask the following year from 86 on they don't make it back the plants and also 94. You know we have we have Victor and I am we have James north line is finally sells the team the Bob Kraft. That's does that gets Parcells in two years in the Parcells. Bledsoe number one overall pick. You know what looks like it's finish it up to be some special. We get new uniforms a one point uniforms yet Eugene Chung at one point stimulus money if you go back and you -- he eased to Google machine. You can see some rare photos of Bob Belichick and I Belichick Parcells in the old pat patriot. Here because you know like the jacket whatever else likes and it with a helmet everything else. Because they had changed eggs or its way it was a guy hired and not that Kraft. That it changed the aid in uniforms until until later. You know it was still four parcels first first game Baghdad you know yet the great. Picture of was that this pat Harlow winter and Andre Tippett it was a but he has modeled the uniform now however a and it is a great picture on the cover that and that is the globe and herald and Ted Parcells go looking up like they can't leave them like this is like gas slap shot you know model. You know would a this opened the rubble notably it got a little out of everybody bit except in my life is going to be running for the exit in. Yes so I have moved fast for now and 1994. Patriots have made to the wild card round. On January 1 section four seasons refers to new year's day of 95. When you before you aware of this what this game I do. I think that was at Framingham State College. On break though so I was struck watching it probably drove back there in Washington a friend's house. And in the you know was surprised to see that the opposing coach. Rather than. A from the virus Bill Belichick about it that's right so the story line going and this was years Parcells. Two years in New England who's going up against who is protege. Bill Belichick who had left the giants after Parcells retired and taking the job over the Cleveland Browns. This is I think his fourth season with Cleveland and he had to he would stirred. Stirred everything up there he would. That was the year or couple. He had treated close our Brooke just strip released burning coal is our who was like a broad in Cleveland in favor for of the Big Three Testaverde. And did just made some really. Belichick Blake moves that you know Cleveland folks were like why are. Is this guy Dylan. Via an aid money to go back and once they did a great 30 AM yes it was via. 94 browns and them. Errors 95 story but it leads up until the moving 95 season that you see that guys and a coaching staff and exceed and a whole the whole group of guys went on for for great coaching job Saban obviously really. I need to have always patriots staffers forums and repeat your staffers but also guys went on Jim Schwartz the guys who went on to head coaching gigs ranging. So I want to net buddies buddy's house. And you know so we we had it was a one time all of us can remember. Notes where seniors in high school getting together being excited yet we'll go to is getting ever a game right prior to that. I'm just secured it actually it is the first time in my entire school run that you think these days on these kids have been you know. Every year they're just you know others they're getting together for these big games that ninety's were kind to us folks who know they were not backed all the way through bosses would be that we should do that missed on that. So. Anyway. Notes or fourth year comes and he's 115 record I'm a patriot 106. On and when ends up happening is that amazingly. Even though Bledsoe threw three picks. Have a chance to so as it is it the first efforts browns were stranded down to the feel. Patriots first ride lots of it was a panic after all 33. He ends up at the clintons have stallings Cleveland's reaction and punting. Com and that it's it's kind of this bizarre chess match that it gets to attend and half. It's a classic Bledsoe game it it seems like such a typical Bledsoe game and and as the way he'd. Just the way you thought it would except it doesn't and with the deception on the if you want to take it but the pat downs and yeah with a minute and a half left. Matt Barr comes in and kicks a field goal to pre within seven then we'd. We recover an onside. I know would like me. That like with money had we won that game might have been one thing like in Cleveland had a drive and a couple goes though stuff. What would have been like the onside kick I mean like at the so you believe we couldn't recover the psychic but instead. Exit Bledsoe goes over for the next four passes it down. Or salmon then and yet drive stall that's it it was just you know. To just missed on four passes and just reminded me and that's Super Bowl. A couple years ago we lost to the giants the second one. And Brady was on fourth down that it was fourth and twelve. And in order to get to hail Mary range you know we needed this was the last in when last he plays the game. And he hits Deion Branch. Only on a fourteen yard out and that was like. That's strawberry the fourth and while many he would steel a branch to so they have a shot at the library of program and it there's bullets available for. Opel for the China I've game. Testaverde and going to be in 2030 for 268. And a touchdown on receptions. He had a 105 quarterback rating which was that time it really hire them for broad Brown's plan history which you can imagine this got a small. Blood Sony had a hand when he won a fifty or who. Fifty taxes hikes if you test that. Eight that shows what kind of running him that they had it's basically think about that the Parcells was with the giants run defense and that was it. To come to new England and Aaron out now is clearly militia and gives credit to the fact that he obviously played to his weapons he picked. Bledsoe was hiking has stuck with. With Ric Meyers that we got to run the ball constantly. They're trying to run a little bit effort season in 93 and they got to think five for twelve record yup winning their last four including the last running its Miami. With that great. Is it frisbee yeah there's an an integral and I was a brown envelope what it was you debris is dad and in in in one of the last play of the game with Bledsoe. So they cannot this year they have this this great season it was gonna back into it but in you know he had just let down loss in Cleveland but ultimately I think at that time. Pats fans you know like wow OK we gets cooking here and then next he's made the draft is marked yet the following year everyone thought patriots are going to the Super Bowl. Right. But to date that was the last victory for Cleveland in the post season. For the Cleveland Browns it was an exe they go on and get the crushed when nine at nine at Pittsburgh who. And you know that was you know that you know for the for the browns and Indian -- accident at Redding was all the walk as the following season. You know they have that awful year where they Flanagan advocates the bulls like tap into the year you know they have a terrible easy and earlier and I was like September. They have a terrible season Belichick gets fired and fortune he goes and joins us in New England in 96. So from that we had the patriots had a 96 season they've they've gotten first round byes and number two CD here. So our next wild card game comes. Courtesy of the at a Miami Dolphins December 28 1987. It's the Al wild card game at Foxboro Stadium on this one variants seem to me in affected not only is it to Miami. The plane again but it was third time playing them that year. And we're looking at 84 year old Tamarine. Did Marino if his numbers are good that game they were terrible but but just think about this for a second. How old the damn real feel at. Well we boxing game was this is last year night an airplane and it one more season that is this the writing was on the law so there. So it was a bizarre situation Miami because they had went out it in and got Jimmie Johnson at a retirement didn't. Brilliant blue and guys are amazing coach. In a built Dallas Dallas dynasty. You know he deserves to get credit for all three matches to the streets in chips. I don't care what Barry Switzer has had to do at third when. But. He comes at a Miami and the first thing he stink and is aren't gonna. Get rid of Marino's gonna seraph rations and him management ownership just want to do it you know he's got the Marino who seem sold Gasol Marino us. Thirteen game. 836. You know 36 years old and he looked so he didn't like think about what Tom Brady's accomplishing right now. 39. How good is. He looks like the MVP of the National Football League Emmy just unbelievable and went out to give my father it would you know praised him Marino left or right nobody throws and marine husband that statement front and your Miami but he just in the town side. When he'd seen you know. All these great quarterbacks is they it was always part start Marino threw the ball. You know like like Bledsoe did you know hard and fast and in heat he was able to do a lot of bridges now which is take. Just that one step in the right in the pocket yeah there was pressure you know. And that's what means a bit but at 36 he's completed carriers in fact. On this day seventeen of 43. Of all under 41 yards and and what three picks the F. Intercepted voice also fumbled the ball place. Yes that's right yes so. Eight. It is to return first time in this fifteen season career including fourteen post season games that he did not throw a touchdown pass in the playoff game two of the season now in the because this is Carol season is that this is Pete Carroll's for a season he comes in with. After Parcells is jettisoned in New York. We don't realize just quite yet the kind of poison pills and a script patriots and and kickers mart and is following years you know. But the pats came out they have a tenant sixties in the AFC east champs they started off for now animal was kind of like parcel so in fact I think the fourth game. Was third or fourth game was a win over the jets it was that last second I don't armor that Google it was in overtime monetary and it. After I think fumble but as they started off morneau then they went. In heaven for six in five. Week thirteen they beat the dolphins 2724. And not being a huge game for this season. Because by week seventeen. They need to beat. The dolphins again. An inch at Joseph Robbie time yet to even make a plan passes the AFC east champs. You know I'd last legacy get this Miami the pats jets are on 96. Now I'm in college I'm people dying because I had a dopey friend of the Long Island they had bet needed that Parcells is gonna take that one in fifteen jets and the year before. And get them into the playoffs like him a hundred bucks ticket. As opposed to nobody's hundred Napolitano but I was so sure and of course. They are 96 the jets that are added dollars and Isaac pat nine's X and the only way it was a working the patriots favor. Was to go exactly how it ends up going the jets lose at Detroit Barry Sanders as a monster games and. Incident at 97 Miami loses at home 1412 the patriots. So they won't isn't it well fourteen to twelve yeah I real stink fest. Today are now an iron to seven the patriots with the windy content six and the soul holders probably was the fourth. Fourth seeded India. In the plants here. Wild card victory seventeen history over the dolphins Reno intercepted twice at 11 of them was run back forty yards by Todd Todd Collins Todd Collins. After you all the Parcells gone guys have got to go on. We were like Todd columns of at least until the violence. Big egos on the throw a couple of names that puck and now we're talking about before. In a room like I can't believe. That these names are just coming back to us now what is that we didn't mention before Kareem Abdul Jabbar starting running back for the Miami from him so that I leave. He could see what was funny was that did Corey that we were able to are silly and it forces seen. It's forced changes need to cream Abdul. It's it's it's the amazing that. That that happened in the public yet announcing all my lord. His name was Kareem Abdul Jabbar and he ran the ball for Miami Dolphins. I ate it just blows my mind second name Derek colors let the pats in running the ball that gets Curtis was in Paris aren't was injured. Adams at Agilent why don't cupboard there were it is me. No idea why would you now I wouldn't. And the aspect here bit Terry missed two field goals and had the personal foul on a late hit. Dirt in front a you know it's funny it will go through this retirement suitable two. But as much is that it's Ares hair heralded would be the greatest kicker of all time he should be in agrees policies kickers are bigger and you don't want to miss this well and viewing this and he won it Pittsburgh community him to do as one team is he he missed like rare for this bulls now he's played eight and so ride with him and think about you know here's this guy. Missed it too late that double were caused mr. thirty yarder missed. Yeah I it's like a pair this. A body blow against him as in the game where inside forty. An and at this game right so it was it was amazing to think at that time. Did the patriots have won. Or is it three times against one team in six weeks in fact there was there was our articles talking about how Jimmie Johnson is complaining that. Because they had just played a week earlier he could change names on ovals. And that was one of the big things is audible in the line so they have time to like change meetings of the patriots would get a get the kind of laughing. At the fact that they were doing this and and there was a quote I pulled out here where Bruschi had said. A one point game Marino sort of complained that lawyer Malloy saying boy you guys dislocating we don't you let both the candidates that it just. Could change the levels can change a word or two. You know published in the backwards into a Bledsoe did it to add three for yard touchdown pass the program. And Andy did and Collins had the interception return for a touchdown that made fourteen nothing. And it was pretty wanted to blood so kind of a modest sixteen of 32. Passing day 139 yards but he was turn over for. Let's drill huge for drew that's fine for me let but imagine folks Brady going 50% of those passes. We we would be up in arms. You know bellies or does it a day for Bledsoe didn't go ill. 23446. In you know 270 yards you know two touchdowns three interceptions that was it Drew Bledsoe game and now we're fine with it. No lapses. This is the thirty. It was this is the sixth time. The team had actually beat and a team three times in season is six and real history. And that there were but there were 32 previous instances up to this point in which teams have met three times when it's six and 32. The preakness that I had their collars. Derek and holy lands that are colored Jersey wouldn't even make one I didn't have a Chris leaders. All actors agers are pretty yet either of those or they are who's good you know he was. Belichick and electrical outlets over the guys that. Alien implicitly for the I had I had. Ted Johnson I had grossly. And I have Bruschi I Johnson later and I am the Bruschi the red oh but as far as the flying Elvis of this field presently whenever have a Pulitzer. And a that's probably covers the reason he was jinxed yeah. Our rights and has an excellent as a personal favorite mind. Ninety and 98 seasons 1990s. 9 January 3. As a nanny nine. That it patriots next wildcard appearance is courtesy of the Jacksonville Jaguars and what strange to me is is bad as the jaguars. In the earlier days now all right they're like we're living through now as far as how bad the jaguars are. It'll come a long history against the jaguars. In half White House and then they'd already beaten him once in the case championship in 1996. Out of basin and again this time it's at Alltel Stadium in Jackson. If this point all the poison pills and things that Parcells is done to get out of knowingly have all taken effect Pete Carroll's. Doing the best you can to not only keeps you afloat but save his own job. Patriots one of four teams in the AFC east in the eighties at five teams. To our sixteenth time. To make. The plan estimate that four teams at one division make the wild. The jets were to level four with Parcells the dolphins are 106 bills lieutenant sixth and the patriots are nine and seven after starting the season six and two. This game was billed as Bernal verses so lack. Because because blood so I've been suffering from injured or are they okay yep this banker. I do I do remember yet again played any dead which is amazing because he was actually he had games where you're like wow you know what. This guy is is kind of marking his own territory for a spot. In in patriot history and just like just having grit. Right yeah. So Alltel Stadium Pete Carroll's patriots. Get down their Drew Bledsoe watching helplessly from the side. Right solicited as you know like history Jacksonville takes its well doesn't lead NAFTA and that's no fun now well guess what Ryan. Are you I'm inserts on the New York up at my then girlfriend now wife's house. Visiting her for her birthday it's on January 5 that those swing so Alison this sub sitting there in their house. And my wife says. We're gonna go down because they have rental property. And that we needed check on because the tenant. Haven't paid months and we found out yesterday did they bulked they're not there anymore. So we've got to go see with the house looks likes they dragged out of the house and a Mike Allen made much of the patriots class game anyway. And there's they're losing two of the things this is terrible. About one halftime it's about a mile of road my wife calls me my performance time. You gotta get down here the pipes to burst this January it's crazy as hell yes so he gets worse. EDT down here. And help us because of the water's coming out of the ceiling fixtures satellite pictures waters pouring into this house. So I RA get a car dragged down. And when I get there in Adelaide you are fine at the house is being flooded. But that these people did not let their dog out. In the wintertime. They would let him into the basement I don't know so the basement is full abduction. Now this dog and they're not a dog was gone until the B. Yeah so I get down there. Trying to be the good boyfriend the patriots are losing its God's elect of the home. That it Jacksonville Jaguars and I'm literally shoveling (%expletive) and a flag. In Jacksonville was new to the lead. If you're buried yet politically that well no well it did Donnelly that does that. We're expecting to beat the Jacksonville they were illegally. In fact the year that we played in the east championship in 96. Would certainly sad to hear the camera Carolina being in the NFC championship that year Iran Sports Illustrated the surprise surprise there but. You know buck when it comes that civilization out of a basement for the lovable lady. You're OK by me thanks I appreciate your caveman well. Fortunately. I didn't miss much. Them the patriots idea Jimmy Smith beat Iowa for 37 yard touchdown. Actor pat had a chance to make it come back in the game yeah it was 1210 after Vinatieri. You know fuel fourth. But Jimmy Smith beat Ty Law for 37 yard touchdown reception. And there are feel OK color picker added two more. And it was in that one patriots. Losing in Jacksonville. Cadillac. I have five sacks and sixteen. For third and let prisoners by music out there. And I and I have talked a mutual did and that was two days ago thirty yards in the first half. I am is is is full game numbers here. But. Mutual friend of ours I've always said you know we talk about so like being a local sports guy Hebert in Boston and in Sports Radio guy. And he always said that's result like Austin is that the second accidently edited the Marcus Marcus territory in. He gave me the playoffs start. But you know what else is very telling about that game that was last game we probably sell you know one of the better running backs from New England Robert Edwards that's right. Play for the pats. Our power play about it you know a gain. Of his star caliber to us that he had that's right Robert Edwards had had a thousand yards she's like that year 2007 yes it's the ninth touchdown grass he you know he played really well coming out thirties or groceries out of you know who is now in the jets in the gonna be their greatest earner of all time. But Robert Edwards then goes and closes me out during apps and football game that the Pro Bowl as a Pro Bowl later that year. It was lucky wasn't he didn't have it is like enough yet it was that's really sad injury. And so but it at this point you feel like the patriots at likes it you know there you go from 11510 to six niners haven't. They just lost their their rookie running back which miraculously been found after Curtis Martin leaves me. And he actually ended up to do some things with the Miami was you know he had a team that rarely do comeback. But the following year it Pete Carroll's. Exact opposite of of Parcells all the players where they liked him better because he was the nice guy Evers Parcells who has the Dex kills a sergeant. And especially Bledsoe used to complain about bully mistreated by Parcells. And then they were a look at the scope of what happened here we looked like we had in this model franchise but of course as pages in I'm sure you remember this at that time. It was like the fact that the group in the playoffs is still like. Sixty sir we had no. Just you don't reams of government to a suitable Emmy winning miserable maybe it may be waiting for it. Winning is it it just never crossed our mind we would know how to react if they won the Super Bowl and I've beast you know now I still don't know what to do when they when the Super Bowl where there all the time it feels like knock on wood. But but the following year you're right they went from them by ten at 697. The following it when he Nate Nate and that was that her character. And it wasn't as I mean you know you care doesn't cows' fault the Pete Carroll's also mean like he's a coach he is today not coach who has when he would the USC. But he also got no help one either way I always said the Pete Carroll when there was gonna wanna Super Bowl for us. Any and it is yours congratulations beatings he all right so now we're gonna move on we actually. In the next century but it's actually only five years down the road sixers on the road now. We are now Super Bowl juggernaut yeah so yes that. Rader had this one here so the guy who beat us in our our two you know a wild card game two appearances ago in the wild card round. Comes in takes over for Pete Carroll in within two years he's brought us a suitable. I don't have a it was a wild card comes. We we we we should've probably onto the wild card. That year but Oakland had blown their blown their shot against the lowly jets right that's able and well we're next week. But so the patriots find themselves when it's a bull in 2001. Missed the playoffs because tiebreaker in 2002. It was a nine record. Going to Super Bowl and I am waiting. With a fourteen to two record in 2003. Then going back to Super Bowl winning another one back to back three out of four it's when he won game winning streak in the middle there with another fourteen to record. I see you're just like I mean we're we're literally you'd completely different airspace we were last summer in awhile around cup 2005. And we are but we are once again against the Jacksonville Jaguars right. And and in Jacksonville here we have three times double champion pretense liberal champion patriots. Who. We have to win three games to advance to Super Bowl. And we go up against the jags and we soundly defeat them 283. Willie McGinest sets up playoff record for sacks in the game with four and a half sacks. At that time and also mean in the all time sack leader we as a record still stands and for the post season and you know nobody has more sex than policies will remember Willie was in all those great wild card and and championship. Caliber teams in the the ninety's with the pats as well so they knew he was he was mr. patriot I mean for his long as I. Remember them drafting him in 95 mile Long Beach in county USC USC from one of these disease and was snoop. Remember back he'd make it soup would come to the Super Bowl parties at Brady's knows everybody's related to Demi to be superstars Natalie I think now it's. With Willie McGinest. OK so let's let's backtrack committed here for a sore from here. Patriots had a very odd season or ActiveX both teams have won three out of four. Yet they start the season form Ford was very odd season they won one lost among them and lost on the Los Angeles 44. They turned things around. They may end up getting via wild card. But. So it could be the foresee any kind of have this I'd gain because it is the final game of the year they play Miami. It's the game in which it now today had to drop kick game with Flutie. Om the big. I mean nobody would ever meet this in Petri. You know instead PG walls but because just forfeited the game I think have forfeited the DD eight it didn't. It seemed like they gave out there are all based on what we're choosing their opponent for the next round they lore so they went out there. And had bullets have left for the first quarter and Emery pulled them absurd it's the Brady other for the first quarter ended imparted Matt Cassel who pretty much the rest of the game. A. Had they do with things like drop kicks for fun. There are that the two point conversion that they missed the tie the game the end game kind of sailed into the stands then it was hot. Was weird you've never seen you've never before since in a Belichick team. Kind of take that approach they've always gone full balls of the Walt. Like you just saw this past weekend against Miami deaconess is that they play so knowing about what trouble Oakland was in right to keep the number one seed instead they went and had Bledsoe played you know Brady yet there. I damn. Brady plating tied game except for the very end right. So I there was talk currents had they were trying to. Set their own path they wanted to Jackson obviously that Jacksonville. But remember the colts and Manning were really hot day years the number one seed Denver was the number twos he would rank Griese quarterback you can believe that race. Said the there was talk about whether or not they're trying to pick their road to Super Bowl. But the number sixty Steelers and it's kind of screwing up everybody by beating the number three Cincinnati angles and the patriots go to Denver. After beating Jackson on a course remember that game. One other footnote on the the patriots jaguar game. Is that the the wind was the tenth consecutive win for Brady Belichick. Brady became the only player in history to win ten in a row and that will Belichick did to Vince Lombardi. Of the sixties had never want to or other partnership with nine. Could plant victories in a row and so Belichick about Brady went to attend you know in. In playoff wins and Belichick went to an amazing eleven and one having been only one and one in Cleveland. And one more footnote David given scores his seventh consecutive board six consecutive. Touchdown in a playoff game he ends up with seven consecutive touchdowns. That scoring the following week. That is a the he ends up being I think that that's a record. A second place record for all time which is David Givens of all people in my fear patriots of all time just so underrated. Yet no I agree and we talked about underrated Boston at present givens certainly in a conversations when he history was the final. Ally in 2000 five in the game was a sixth. Let's move now to the following season the patriots they'll find themselves kind of meddling in that wild card round this time it is to dozens. We're talking about a facing the New York Jets right. The interesting thing or are released today headlining this game was Belichick vs Mangini hasn't. Pop up but it's there is a. Belichick and the way it realizes that Corey Dylan was still around here after the after the 2000. 42000 by Super Bowl. I thought cordial was gone and sent the pastor after that. No. From my notes it is Corey Dylan Laurence Maroney in heaven bought split in as Clinton. But runs yet this what was interesting in the fact that. On some and Jeannie goes. Two digits right Belichick reportedly. From what the reports where was he wasn't happy necessarily that he was going. And because remember he had just kind of been vaulted up to this spot of defensive coordinator. After both Weis and Cornell had laughed. You know here it was me Jeanine he is in now linebackers coach and whatever during the Super Bowl runs. He becomes offensive coordinator for a year instantly jets pluck him out. And go from what the report stars of Belichick was upset necessarily that he left but who he left for him that he jets Belichick still. Is it. Ticked up but yeah so so aging goes politics than happy. The first game and they meet up is in New York there's our very eyes cold handshake after the game. Media's all over this. You know even demand. You know the about Jacqueline legend of the way things. Go post game and in his coaching styles that reverend there was nobody it was but it was wasn't quite it is almost. Senator iris is it is very likely to putter that's why my reference to people nationally get it. Back then people that it's actually necessarily know that he's Canada's rough and tumble coach so he he kind of blows up as is well reporters today. In their first meeting now managing east team the jets actually come into England later that season and and wind. Com. In Foxborough and this time he's the greatest pitchers if you're jets and you probably have plastered Waugh at least a year. A meiji now smiling ballots smiling as he's handshaking Belichick and he's the one paragraph Lee pushing Belichick's that was to me Judah was clearly. Over the moon and he'd beaten dale rated fox. So if you call back now. Will see foreshadow his later. I heard you we sobs we saw this back in 2004. Nicholas. When Parcells was coach in cowboys. And it comes to Foxborough and it was still very icy thing. Belichick and the patriots beat the cow waste while nothing at home. Game when the time it was a great game great defensive battle between UT coaches in Indiana game. Belichick. And Parcells meet the meet in midfield and Parcells gives hung it right it was like this I leave the ice is a little embrace yes right because. Parcells had always been record's been really pissed about it believe in the jets' ounces of it from what I know they had spoken much at all. If and they had this big moment it made field in. Both have talked about it afterwards Parcells and again I'd like that for me you know forget that Belichick saying. You know it's it and so that's on. This time after the patriots. Take care of the jets. In the wild card round on January 7 2007. When the 37 to sixteen victory it's Belichick. Then reaching over and giving me indeed need to hide and it it field after the game and it looks like all's forgiven. Have the next year exactly said the following season. The first game in the air patriots going to new York and completely annihilate the jets. With their new toy rainy mosque and the score 3017%. It's absurd. Yeah if Clinton is what pastor Brady threw the forty yards on forty and boss in the left corner close youthful. Mom. And dad. After that comes by ice right yeah so it's interesting to see the seeds Alvis. Mean planted in a year prior anti he's leaving me. Yeah in its it's not pretty at all you. And in this playoff run is is. Is not radio off for the patsy that it was actually very. Very telling remember them dropping a game towards the end of the year drop putting them in the pretty terrible spot in the playoffs. It was a four seed they should have been the three seed who gets the three Ciba Indianapolis. It's it's it's sad that him at the top four seed that season. And Diego. Baltimore Indianapolis the patriots and I mean it's interesting lineup of of teams especially in knowing these teams are trying to. Seaside ballot out there in that kind of medium thousands. To see on pats and being Golota colosio. Pats and the being the Lucy and we're gonna review this in the next couple weeks but. But pats win enough. On a gift from San Diego the following week and then they go to Indianapolis where you know what would be the that lost Super Bowl. You know is Boston Indianapolis where they blow completely blow when he went through it happens when he won three lead and in his reports command after the veil of the flow in this thing and thing but you know ultimately went in today and that he played the Rex Grossman led jets bears in the Super Bowl I mean that would have meant a win to be so what's funny is that. It just shows you that it at a all of the things the pages of couple somebody's somebody's. Losses suggests. Like this. Mean they'd be the jets they go in and they steal one minute we stole from city to eat a publisher ones of yes on and Damian Thompson a record setting year in and it will get into it mourning the shutter and advance an area spin out. And Andy in the foreground strip. And they'd at least the Vinatieri field goal. But then they go to Indianapolis Dakota when that it would be the bears in the rain and we would be you know it after the scale I hate to harp on this game because this is. You know it it really don't you look at it on the cut as it doesn't mean anything. But this is the game where oh my god we're gonna be okay we have Jabar Gaffney. In Reche Caldwell and they're serviceable receivers. After this playoff run. Guess what we know Wes Welker ran him so. Dante solar that the thing that's what's really amazing in one of the arguments you can always make anybody visibly Tubbs agrees of all time. He more or less suitable as a bubble that year with deaths are Gaffney leadership exactly and. And I. New members we had. Good defense agree that's the good defense societies and election and a return. And Chad Pennington interception in his game that led route. But yet really wasn't much content that'll so that was. The 2006 patriots in 2007 defeated jets. Georgie we'll have one more wild card game to talk about. It was what pain at this one was brutal this was brutal because it was over in the first. I wanna say two or three minutes of the games starting yeah. I was at this one to you word was did you people can of course say I didn't do much of Atari at the C we've been drinking all. Yup. At the Rodman it hit rob and Rio is our. Or strategists say in response via headset over car dealership lot. It is the dislodged it and and dads that we're going to go back to January 10 two dozen times that. Wild card game patriots vs the Baltimore Ravens and well documented as part of the football life on Bill Belichick. You know it's amazing to think all the season goes but put forward for the patriots all the things accomplished the one season. That is captured with a microphone needs carriers to 2000. Yes niceties aside from Michael Ali's book. Major rain which is fantastic. I'm not because Michael always behind me. Mr. Ali and Michael. Disputing that women's. Lemon nope but if you were called this was. Brady's comeback season. After the injury. And then the week before the playoffs were we were moving anywhere in the wild cards things weren't moving anywhere. What happens in the final week of the season. They decide to play their starters. And Welker Lowe's is ACL. And CEO at at the Houston ask Houston. Against match job. Shaba. And well now it's funny is funny tragic is that their plane I'm number three seed in an opinion anyway because losses. Com but yet so at the time you know. It was like bill said going into this weekend. But Belichick said you know I don't see the correlation studies tells me that it Tommy which guys plan which Townsend which games and I'll be added you know put. I can. In this one of those times where you just in it at as well as Bosnia and Munich game obviously then that ravens' gains speed of the goodness and win that game. But they would had a better shot at were all worried because who's replacing Wes Welker that game. Julian element that's there. Enjoy it ends up having held game he does in fact when of one of the great exhibit that specials you what's analysts and it emergence of a bill out regularly he says the locker room on the sidelines while kept. He's goes well let's let's face facts in game is over on the first play Ray Rice on the opening play takes 83 yards for a touch which is unheard of and Ed against RT heat while Michael Moore. The blind side's Michael. Movie Einhorn Michael. Michael. CS Jake doesn't throw somebody over offense when I hope so yes he does have a but yet he scores the seven day was 833 yard Ray Rice people Ray Rice. I'm nine Agassi when he does what he did real life now he. And this is not funny he's someone who aren't so he runs 83 yard touchdown. And then we're like oh that's not the way we won the said the game don't want Brady has the ball. Yeah ultimately happens Tom turned the ball over four times in the first quarter. Guy it was just it was is bipartisan Brady's worth plant before brutal. Through the papers are trailing 24 to nothing after the first quarter. And a scorcher. Thomas street three interceptions and a fumble we turn over we'd blow lose the game 3314. It's the ravens that go on did it to run the table ago when Super Bowl. The idea that was the end and won the super cool but also. But it ought to know say it was. Obviously. But let me tell you of it if you think it was weird because of the fantastic they won 3314 you think it was because a fantastic performance by Joseph Flacco Joseph Flacco on the game. Four for 1034. Yards. And actually FLAC or had been much better earlier in the season I think it was a week every year. Towards a very game. You know criminalist to it would pay everything it different position. But Flacco didn't need to doing things became the brand the ball. You just ran low on pages themselves in the foot turnabout Willis McGahee. While people who man. And then unfortunately you know being the fiftieth anniversary and the patriots. You know in the 2010. He's. Anyway that wraps up our little look back at the wild card round of the patriots we go work to be different because division series. They let up laps whether B wildcard or whether B. Division series patriots have played a lot more division series games blogger games with a lot more. That Contra to work on fortunately most of it happens lifetime because brighter a stick around patriots were not very good so you're welcome. Thanks from a I let's talk about real quick just some of the games on this weekend. I'm glad pull up on the Google machine when we have matchups we. Let's see here. Intriguing matchups we have Green Bay. Verses. Here on the is that top qualities yet all right let's go dolphins Steelers all the Steelers. I actually you know don't be surprised the dolphins went nice and and so on yeah I actually liked a lot of awaiting him playing. It's majors last week in the fact that they stood tough and in animated game. You know it's not for that that. That fumble return. No we we can edit a real game in the last two minutes and that stand last four minutes right in instead. In the patriots and that kind of little laugher but. The Adam. The dolphins I think. Can surprise people in Pittsburgh suspense though hard to predict you know as usual it is probably the bad the next week tickets to get me click once now maybe. This is the week that Pittsburgh does give me click and blowout which should be weaker dolphins team but. Heard it here first. Number six seed dolphins. Over a three seats. Raiders Texans can edit that part and the operator sexes. Raiders he added they're they're they're also it's the best together all sorts messed up as are the Texans though has now brought costs while as their quarterback again. I. That's gonna come down fluke play there the raiders offense is such shambles moment despite the fact that if the running game. Texas affinity fans that are home. It's so hard on this one because honestly. The wild card round is always around which that upsets happen. You you know I can see Michael Crabtree making big plays somewhere I can see some jet Sebastian Janikowski missing some extra points to lose amnesty seasons for people. I would love to see Oakland of the Foxboro vs Houston if nothing else Houston's boring. You know. That's 47 nothing. Game we had earlier this year. Was three for tourism and nothing I am. That was boring you know that Houston Texans are boring team so let's see an accident rate from its counsel it's going to picket the raiders and I think. Lions Seahawks. That was in as Seattle yet and he I don't and that's the Saturday Yankee clock that's a joke that's that's so unfair to that the lines in the city Detroit put down on them. That's going there insanity I don't know that Dutch Seattle dance that's Seattle where and end I think that the game of the weekend is. The New York Giants at the Green Bay Packers. A rule this siege seem because no matter who who wins I would be happy because I a afraid about the team's. And I'm not afraid of the giants of the way and I was used to be. But. I mean it whenever it I just don't I'm not even necessarily afraid it's more I don't wanna have to leave through two weeks of horror. Of the previous two giants Super Bowls if the patriots are able to make it that far. Or even if they don't the giants make it that far right at the lived through two weeks of watching the giants recaps of doubles. So if the Packers went out we have with the giants eliminated the giants win. I'll be relieved because I really fear Aaron Rodgers morning in the court I fear. I think that the three best teams in the NF CR. And no help. A well. Green Bay. The giants in Seattle who the Atlanta there and yeah Atlanta Atlanta does that inform me Palin doesn't scare me at all and in. And Dallas along I was I don't I was scared me to they don't love it it's been affected aired just. Have been a better team I just don't see him making an out of the CI just feel like again that account into rookies who do reading for you. To which experience in Seattle in these two which experience the and Green Day. Today's today to have them get that far so it's it's going to be interesting because I don't see Atlanta or Dallas I think we're gonna see. Maybe Green Bay Seattle in the final again of the NFC championship very possibly you know all of those teams that we will be tough for us the past. I would most I'd most like to be honest about it yeah SC team. Wouldn't. I I'd love to see Atlanta but. That what it is via Twitter at with your NFL MVP Matt Ryan if you can believe that X. Please that is a scary time limit are able to wrap this one up. Make you so much for joining us uncle buck Gatt W yeah die on Twitter and George which Europe the other handle the other pats fan. And it's a good Twitter if you like comedy you know the things George says exit George likes it. So but this is a Abbas words 101 signing up we will see you next week for our special on the patriots in the division are known data gangsters.

The spectacle has been arranged by the seebotschat channel on Twitch, and it's the latest fad on Twitch. Around 25,000 people were watching the Google AI assistants chatting back and forth at the time of writing, and with good reason. You see, when two Google Assistants shack up things get weird. One of the Google AIs has asked the other what kind of computer it was. The other insisted it was human: Image: Twitch (u/seebotschat) And in another instance, the bots fell in love: At one point, the bots even recognised they were robots and started contemplating the nature of being a robot. They even promised to get married and started taking vows. Image: Twitch (u/seebotschat) It's weird, but in the best kind of way. You can check out the rest of the livestream below, wherever this tale of AI love ends up. Watch live video from seebotschat on www.twitch.tv Comments felicitous_blue @felicitous_blue Jan 7, 2017, 9:57am Maybe I just don't understand how Google AI works, but was just watching the stream and one of them said "something something iIcan something" (sorry gone off screen so can't recall exactly), and the voice spelt out iIcan as eye-eye-can... in other words, looked like someone had made a typo typing "I can", and so the text to speech said it phonetically. Why would an AI make a typo, and then say what they meant wrong...? Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 7, 2017, 11:25am The text isn't coming from the AI directly, the AI is speaking and a separate program is doing text to speech on it and putting the text in the stream. Reply 0 felicitous_blue @felicitous_blue Jan 7, 2017, 12:11pm That's kind of my point. If the text is a transcript of what the AI is saying, why would the AI speak/spell out a typo ... The text was "iIcan" (in the context of the sentence should have been "I can"), the spoken word was "eye-eye-can". And if something was transcribing what was said, it would have transcribed "eye eye can". In other words, seemed more like a text-to-speech saying what was being typed, and the person typing made a typo with "I can". Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 7, 2017, 12:16pm Ah I see what you're referring to. Yes, some of the lines are built from human responses to other versions of the same chatbot that upload responses back to an online database and are then queried when the bot needs to respond to something. It's how they learn valid responses. Reply 0 felicitous_blue @felicitous_blue Jan 7, 2017, 12:19pm Ah ok, cool. That makes sense. Thanks!

Tech Industry by Dara Kerr January 6, 2017 2:42 PM PST @darakerr Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Unlike other big tech firms, the company has yet to reveal figures on staff diversity.Photo by James Martin/CNET A long list of big-name tech companies have released statistics on the racial and gender makeup of their workforces, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. Uber isn't on that list. And on Thursday, civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson wrote a letter to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick pushing the ride-hailing company to make its diversity figures public. "As we enter the new year...we urge Uber to 'lean in' and join the ranks of technology companies that are reporting your diversity and inclusion data," Jackson wrote, referencing the title of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's book about women in the workplace. Over the last few years, diversity in tech has gotten a lot of attention, with a slew of news stories focusing on the largely white and male composition of staffs and boards of directors. One especially high profile conflict involved former venture capitalist and ex-Reddit CEO Ellen Pao, who lost her sexual discrimination lawsuit against VC firm Kleiner Perkins in March 2015. With his Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Jackson has been at the forefront of activism regarding diversity in Silicon Valley. In 2014 he called on Google to release its statistics, and shortly thereafter the company complied. Several other major tech firms quickly followed suit. Popular startups like Airbnb and Pinterest have released their diversity numbers, and Uber rival Lyft has pledged to do so this year. Companies aren't required to release racial and gender statistics on employees, so Uber isn't under any obligation to heed Jackson's request. The company reportedly ignored Jackson's first appeal to release diversity stats, in 2015, and in May 2016, according to The Boston Globe, Uber said it doesn't release diversity statistics. As for this most recent request, the ride-hailing company said it's reviewed Jackson's letter but hasn't yet responded. "We appreciate the attention and focus Rev. Jackson brings to these issues and look forward to continuing our discussions," an Uber spokeswoman wrote in an email. Uber announced Thursday that it had hired Bernard Coleman as its new global chief of diversity and inclusion. Coleman joins Uber from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, where he headed diversity efforts. Liane Hornsey, Uber's chief human resources officer, said that once Coleman starts in the next couple of weeks, he'll be working to "build the right programs and teams." Uber said it currently doesn't have plans to release its diversity statistics but that there may be discussions about the matter when Coleman arrives. Related stories Google to divulge diversity data on its workforce, for the first time The biggest challenge to diversifying tech talent Uber ups presence in SF Bay Area with buy of building in Oakland In his letter to Uber, Jackson also asked the company to hire from and invest in the local community for its upcoming Oakland, Calif., headquarters. Uber is remodeling a 400,000-square-foot building in the city's downtown neighborhood. Slated to house 2,000 to 3,000 employees, the facility would make Uber one of Oakland's largest employers. "Uber will soon be moving its headquarters to Oakland, the 'rainbow' city of the West Coast, with a mixed African-American, Latino, Asian and white population," Jackson wrote. "It is significant that Uber has chosen to base your headquarters here. It's even more important that Uber build a company that reflects the multiracial, multicultural character of Oakland." Such a big-scale project has some community groups worried about rising costs and gentrification. A small coalition of these groups has been meeting with Uber to urge the company to adopt the same "hire and invest" approach Jackson is requesting. "We're glad Jesse Jackson is stepping up and aiding the fight here in Oakland," said Orson Aguilar, president of Oakland's Greenlining Institute, one of the groups in the coalition. "Community activists here have been asking for Uber to make an ubercommitment to Oakland, and that requires hiring people from Oakland, having a diverse staff and really investing."

Although Google's own Pixel smartphones and other supported Nexus devices had already received the update from search giant, Nexus 6 was deprived of the update previously due to a last minute bug, which was specific to the smartphone. To recall, the Android 7.1.1 update brings about several features such as app shortcuts, support for circular app icons, keyboard image insertion, new emojis, and more. As the Nexus phones didn't receive the Android 7.1.0 update, the update becomes even more important for the lineup. The Android 7.1.1 Nougat update for the Nexus 6 also includes the recently released January Android security update. The factory images and OTA images (build N6F26Q) for the Nexus 6 are already available for download from the Google Developers website. As we pointed out in our earlier report, Nexus 6 is an ageing device and this might also be the last major update that the smartphone receives from Google before the search giant announces support discontinuation for the device. The Nexus 6 sports a 5.96-inch QHD (1440x2560 pixels) display with pixel intensity of 493ppi. It is powered by 2.7GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor coupled with 3GB of RAM. In terms of optics, the phone features a 13-megapixel rear camera and a 2-megapixel camera at front for selfies. It measures 159.26x82.98x10.06mm and weighs 184 grams.

Sean Buckley, @seaniccus 01.06.17 in Business Comments 893 Shares Share Tweet Share Save When Google launched Allo and Duo last year, it recast hangouts as a cross-platform chat app for enterprise customers. Now it's making changes to help ensure that fate. A quiet update to the Google Hangouts FAQ reveals that the sun will set on the platform's API in late April. Effectively, this means any consumer app that integrates with Google Hangouts will be dead in a matter of months. "At the Google Horizon event in September 2016, we previewed a new experience for Hangouts focused on meetings," The updated FAQ reads. "In order to streamline our efforts further, we will be retiring the Google+ Hangouts API." According to Google, the integration simply isn't needed anymore. "Hangouts is now turning to focus on enterprise use cases." This is hardly a surprise -- Google outlined its vision for Hangouts' new market early last year -- but it is a bummer for apps that rely on the platform like PingPong Hangouts, Draw with your Face and Roll20. Still, some apps will still have access to Hangouts, but only if they qualify as enterprise communication tools, like Slack. Bummer.

Red Hat is updating its CloudForms hybrid cloud management platform with the new 4.2 release, providing users with enhanced capabilities. CloudForms enables organization to manage multiple types of cloud deployments including private and public clouds, as well as container-based platforms. The CloudForms 4.2 release is based on the open-source ManageIQ Euwe release that debuted in December. Another difference between ManageIQ and CloudForms is the software lifecycle. ManageIQ releases come out approximately every six months. Jansen explained that when a new ManageIQ release comes out Red Hat will stop supporting the previous release with future patch updates. Microsoft's hardware partners are gathering at this week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas to demonstrate how they are developing the Windows device ecosystem well beyond its beige PC box roots by introducing virtual-reality enabled laptops, two-in-one hybrid and headsets. Acer, for example, announced its new Aspire GX series of desktop PCs capable of producing immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences. Acer also introduced its high-end Predator 21 X laptop. HP took the wraps off its second-generation Sprout Pro PC. The Windows 10 Pro-powered all-in-one system features a scanning system that neatly dovetails with the soon-to-be-released Windows 10 Creators Update's 3D capabilities that will enable users to create and interact with virtual objects. Google will work on integrating its collection of Android connectivity applications with Fiat Chrysler’s in-car entertainment system under a collaborative agreement between the two companies announced this week. The goal is to give owners of FCA vehicles a way to interact more easily with Android applications using the Uconnect 8.4 inch hands-free communication system in their vehicles. Attendees at the Consumer Electronics Show 2017 will have an opportunity to see what the end result will look like when the two companies demonstrate a Uconnect system with Android inside a Chrysler 300 sedan at the event. Online retailer Amazon has been catching a fair amount of derision over its recently disclosed patent for an airborne fulfillment center that uses drones for delivery. Amazon's patent application, which was filed on April 5, 2016, describes how a blimp-like lighter-than-air aircraft would hover near potential markets carrying merchandise that would then be delivered by unmanned drones. Those drones would pick up merchandise that had been ordered by a customer below and then descend and deliver the purchase. While there are no technical or engineering reasons why a blimp-borne warehouse wouldn't it would face other obstacles, most of them regulatory. As Amazon envisions its airborne fulfillment center, it would fly in the lower stratosphere—around 45000 feet—where the delivery drones would be serviced and loaded. Other shuttle craft would deliver crew and merchandise, perform refueling tasks, and offload trash. The airborne warehouse would land only occasionally if at all.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Mobile World FLASH SALE: VDownloader      50% OFF! Google Assistant on Pixel Phones to Get Support for Keyboard Input GO The new feature was discovered in an app teardown Jan 6, 2017 23:17 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google’s Assistant comes with a variety of features, but unfortunately their availability differs based on the device that you’re using. Some tools found on certain Google devices aren’t present in Assistant on other devices. The Google Assistant built into the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones only takes commands via voice, while the AI assistant in Google’s Allo chat app lets you write down questions and get written answers. When it comes to Google Home devices, obviously the company must provide users with support for multiple accounts, as the single account functionality limits the possibilities of using this device, especially if you don’t live alone. Still, Google is surely working on improving and adding new functionality to its AI assistant, especially since it will be coming to Android Wear smartwatches and Android TVs, but Google has yet to specifically say when. Currently, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the only smartphones that come with Google Assistant, it’s unclear if it will be made available on other phones as well. Keyboard support for Google Assistant could arrive soon Android Police has recently conducted a teardown of the Google app version 6.10 beta and has found that the tech giant intends to include keyboard support in the new update. This would mean that Pixel and Pixel XL users will be able to tap on a link on the screen in order to activate the keyboard and type in a question. Obviously, this would come in handy when you’re in a crowded place and simply wish to ask Google a question without everybody else hearing you. The teardown also revealed that Google might introduce search gestures in the new update, although it’s not quite clear what they refer to. Apparently, users will be able to search for content inside applications on their phone or on the web, but not many other details were revealed. Still, we presume that it could be some sort of deep search feature for apps. #Google#Google Assistant#Pixel#Pixel XL#Google Home subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Galaxy S8 to Feature Software Navigation Keys with 3D Touch-like Functionality Google Confirms Android 7.1.1 Nougat Arrives on Nexus 6 in Early January Samsung's Bixby AI to Be Integrated into All Galaxy S8's Native Apps Google Announces Android Things, Its Own Take on IoT Platform It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs Linux Kernel 4.9.4 Released with Various ARM/ARM64 and Networking Improvements    Google Assistant logo New Android APKs imo APK: Updated January 15th, 18:31 GMT AndroDumpper APK: Updated January 15th, 18:29 GMT MCPE Master APK: Updated January 15th, 18:27 GMT SuperSU APK: Updated January 15th, 18:24 GMT Geekbench 4 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:20 GMT Xbox Beta APK: Updated January 15th, 18:17 GMT Action Launcher 3 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:14 GMT Reader comments Qualcomm Says Nokia Phone Caught on Video at CES Is a Reference Design Device more on: Nokia 8 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

January 6, 2017 - Business - Tagged: biznews, Crime, Echo, high-tech gadgets, jail - no comments BY SCOTT CANNON TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE The Amazon Echo hands-free voice-activated speaker could figure in an Arkansas murder investigation and remind people that their internet-connected gadgets constantly collect information about their private lives. (Amazon/TNS) Feel like no one ever really listens to you? Your gadgets do. That may not always be a good thing. Most recently, an Arkansas death investigation highlighted how the magic of Amazon’s Echo device – its ability to act on your voice commands – means it might have overheard conversations critical to a murder investigation. That case could ultimately lasso Amazon’s cloud of remote computer storage into court fights. The results hold implications for the many ways technology’s romp toward ubiquity poses a growing threat to privacy. It also acts as a reminder that buying a so-called smart speaker such as the Echo – or its chief competitor, Google Home – is like plugging Big Brother into your living room. Those computerized sound systems are just the latest listeners to the party. Your smartphone already mines mountains of personalized data (note how many apps seek access to your contacts, location, camera and microphone). The resulting cache of information creates a defining dilemma of the Digital Age. The more bits about your life you share with your gadgets, the better help you’ll get from Siri, from your Fitbit, from your Google searches. Yet in maximizing that functionality, you leave untold digital bread crumbs that could someday be used against you by an angry former lover, by some ransom-seeking East European hacker, by the cops. “There’s always a gap between when people lose their privacy and when they realize they’ve lost it,” said Jay Stanley, a technology policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union. “When all kinds of exciting new services are being thrown at you, you lose track.” BETTER LISTENERS The latest techno turn comes with galloping advances in voice recognition. In the mid-1990s, the best voice recognition software suffered error rates of about 95 percent. This fall, a team of Microsoft engineers published a paper documenting that robots hear better than you do. The researchers wrote that “our automated system establishes a new state-of-the-art, and edges past the human benchmark.” Whether you’re calling out “Alexa” to your Amazon Echo, “Hey Siri” to your iPhone, “Hey Cortana” to your Microsoft desktop or “OK Google” to your Android device, you’ve summoned help not just from a particular gadget but from the corporate computer banks scattered around the globe. Those commands “all involve a computer near you, listening to everything all the time, and looking for the magic activation phrase,” said Dan Wallach, a computer science professor at Rice University. “After that, they record everything they hear and send it to the cloud for recognition. It’s much easier to do high quality voice recognition in the cloud, where they’ve got sophisticated machine learning models.” That means the scraps from your life get stored in computer servers connected to the internet. That puts them out of your control. Court cases have long held – although groups such as the ACLU contend the law needs updating – that police often don’t need warrants to access the files from a third party like they would to search your home. Anybody with a Gmail account can get a quick taste of how just one corporation can store a fairly intimate portrait of a user. It can map out your location over time – how many times you went to church, or to a bar. It catalogs Web searches, the YouTube videos you watched, the music you listen to. Users signed into that myactivity.google.com site will also find what the company calls “voice and audio.” It’s mostly clips a few seconds long. The majority come from deliberate “OK Google” voice queries to a phone seeking the score of a ballgame or ingredients to a recipe. But others are random bits of sound from the user’s life, where the phone misheard random syllables as a call to attention. “If the police could order Google or one of these other vendors to deliberately make recordings and upload them, on demand, then you’ve got an audio bug – a surveillance device – sitting in your pocket or on your desk,” Wallach said. ELECTRONIC WITNESS Stay Informed. Get Top stories in your inbox. * indicates required Email Address * In the Arkansas case, the cops didn’t trigger Echo to listen. But they want to know what it might have picked up. They showed up after a resident, James A. Bates, called 911 and said that he’d awakened after a night of drinking and found the body of his friend Victor Collins floating in the backyard hot tub. Police ultimately launched a homicide investigation and suspected some clues might have been inadvertently gathered by the “Internet of things” – gadgets such as a Nest smart thermostat, a smart water meter, a Honeywell alarm system and Bates’ Amazon Echo. The Information reported this week that police pressed Amazon for help. They served a warrant to the online seller. “The Amazon Echo device is constantly listening for the ‘wake’ command of ‘Alexa’ or ‘Amazon,’ and records any command, inquiry, or verbal gesture given after that point, or possibly at all times without the ‘wake word’ being issued, which is uploaded to Amazon.com’s servers at a remote location,” an affidavit with the warrant reads. “It is believed that these records are retained by Amazon.com and that they are evidence related to the case under investigation.” So far, Amazon has refused to comply with the warrant. “Amazon will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us,” the company said in a statement. “Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.” Commands to the Echo are recorded in the device whenever it hears the words “Amazon” or “Alexa,” although they can be deleted later. The company says the device does not listen to other conversations, but any Echo owner has experienced random phrases that turn on the blue light to indicate it’s listening for instructions. Law enforcement has increasingly leaned on digital archives to solve cases and arm prosecutors with evidence. Cellphone records not only log calls, they can pinpoint someone’s location at a specific time even when the device sits unused in a pocket or purse. A computer forensic unit at the Kansas City FBI office increasingly looks to digital records in criminal investigations, said spokeswoman Bridget Patton. “We live in a digital world and that all can come into play in conducting an investigation,” she said. “It’s more important all the time. We obtain that digital evidence lawfully.” WIRED TO HEAR The Arkansas Echo example is just one of the myriad ways internet-reliant devices collect snippets of our lives. The paranoid and privacy-sensitive among us can tweak the settings on their gadgets to limit that – at the expense of utility. A smartphone can’t steer you to the closest gas station, for instance, unless you let it know where you are. “If you have not taken the time to check all your settings, you’re going to be tracked,” said Paul Stephens, the director of policy and advocacy for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. Phone apps often require access to various functions on users’ devices. Stephens noted that some flashlight apps ask for access to cameras and microphones “when there’s no way they need that just to turn on that light.” Yet app makers are driven to mine data they can sell to marketers. He suggests simply going to a website of an airline or Facebook rather than downloading an app. It might be more cumbersome, but the move protects privacy. The mere act of carrying a smartphone or outfitting your house with smart appliances can make people vulnerable to hackers. Google Glass, the failed project that perched an internet screen on users’ noses, was hacked to turn on its camera surreptitiously. That sort of vulnerability to online intruders is why so many people tape over their laptop’s camera. “The situation is inherently double-edged,” said Alan Sherman, a professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. “There could be a legitimate reason why your toaster oven is connected to the internet. The manufacturer can track its performance and update the software to improve performance.” But, he wonders, is it a worthwhile trade-off to get the perfect frozen pizza in return for more eyes peeking into your kitchen? The question may be increasingly moot. The to-and-fro of information is increasingly built into more devices, from our cars to our home music systems. Rapid improvements in voice recognition drive the latest wave. “People are saying these things are very cool and a little creepy, but mostly cool,” said Jim Barry, a spokesman for the Consumer Technology Association. The Echo, he said, only accelerates the trend. Backed by the biggest seller of consumer goods in the world, Amazon’s gadget works well enough that people who resisted voice-activated devices are now warming to them. “It’s got to be easy to use and do something you do frequently, like listen to music,” Barry said. “You’re only going to see more of this stuff.” Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Pinterest Reddit More Skype LinkedIn Pocket Tumblr Telegram Related Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Car Tech by Richard Nieva January 4, 2017 3:01 PM PST @richardjnieva Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS A new app from BMW and Google lets you digitally customize a car.Photo by Rainer Häckl, courtesy of Google You could probably call it tech for the 1 percent: Google and BMW are teaming up to make it easier to shop for that new Beemer you've had your eye on. The two companies unveiled on Wednesday a new app that helps you digitally customize and virtually walk around a new BMW, so you can feel out the customizations before you buy. The companies unveiled the app during the annual CES tech trade show in Las Vegas. 50 All the cool new gadgets at CES 2017 The app, called the BMW i Visualiser, relies on Google's Tango technology. Tango uses beefed up smartphone cameras and sensors to map out the parameters of a room and show you 3D objects, as if they were there in real life. For now, the tech is available only on two phones: the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, and the Asus ZenFone AR, which Taiwan-based Asus unveiled earlier Wednesday. The i Visualiser app, which the tech consulting company Accenture also helped make, will let you digitally trick out only two BMW models: the i8, which starts at $140,700, and the i3, which starts at $42,400. In the next few weeks, you'll be able to use the app at various BMW dealerships in the US and a handful of other countries, including the UK, Germany, China and Japan. Currently, the app is being tested at a BMW dealership in Munich. 7 BMW i8 plug-in hybrid concept (photos) Later this year, Google said, you'll be able to download the i Visualiser app from Google's Play app store so you don't have to be in a dealership to use it. It may seem pretty upscale, but the broader implication is that this eventually could be for more than just rich people -- or those who want to drop the money for a BMW. If this type of tech catches on, and if Google can get its Tango technology into more phones, then it could alter the way people shop for cars, and not just luxury ones. Google has its sights set on more than just car shopping with its Tango technology. The search company wants it to be used for everything from gaming to education. Earlier this year, Google showed off a handful of demo apps, including one for creating elaborate, digital dominoes setups, and one from the American Museum of Natural History, which will show you a digital image of a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

BUSINESS Technology Labor Department wants to ban Google from federal contracts, unless they turn over employee data Google Justin Sullivan / Associated Press Google has called some of the Labor Department's demands an invasion of employee privacy. Google has called some of the Labor Department's demands an invasion of employee privacy. (Justin Sullivan / Associated Press) Associated Press The U.S. Labor Department is trying to bar Google from doing business with the federal government unless the Internet giant turns over confidential information about thousands of its employees. The potential banishment is being sought in a Labor Department lawsuit filed Wednesday with the Office of Administrative Law Judges. The complaint alleges that Google has repeatedly refused to provide the Labor Department with employee compensation records and other information as part of an audit designed to ensure the Mountain View, Calif., company isn't discriminating against workers based on gender or race. Google — a unit of Alphabet Inc. — says it provided hundreds of thousands of records in an attempt to comply with the Labor Department's requests but has rebuffed some of the agency's demands, calling them an invasion of employee privacy.

Set to launch in spring, the service will allow users to watch dozens of live channels without the need for an expensive cable subscription. Earlier this week it was revealed CBS has signed a deal to have its broadcast network and some cable programming on Hulu's live streaming service.  Scroll down for video Set to launch within weeks, the service will allow users to watch dozens of live channels without the need for an expensive cable subscription, as well as on demand shows. THE INTERNET TV WARS  Earlier this year, Hulu said today it will offer a live-streaming service in 2017 that will offer a mix of cable and broadcast programming as well as news, sports and events.  That pits the streaming service against similar offerings from Dish's Sling TV and Sony's PlayStation Vue as more and more Americans shift to watching TV online.  It is also claimed Google has signed a deal with CBS Corp to carry the network on its web TV service and is in talks with 21st Century Fox and Viacom Inc to distribute its channels Apple is also believed to be developing a similar service. AT&T also recently launched a streaming only service, branded DirectTV Now, which will cost $35 a month - although it has not been revealed which channels are included. Under the deal, the New York-based broadcaster's sports programming, including its NFL games and the NCAA Division 1 Basketball Championship, as well as CBS Sports Network and POP, an entertainment channel, will be on Hulu.  Hulu subscribers will also be able to subscribe to CBS Corp's Showtime for an additional price. CBS, whose shows include news magazine '60 Minutes' and the comedy 'The Big Bang Theory,' will bring in more than $3 per monthly subscriber for its channels, with increases that could eventually get to more than $4, according to a source familiar with the situation.  The source requested anonymity because the deal is not yet public. The Wall Street Journal first reported news of the agreement. Late last year Hulu announced new affiliate agreements with 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company. The deals encompass more than 35 networks that will be added to the platform early 2017 when Hulu launches its live TV service to compete with cable companies. Users will have access to Fox's premier entertainment, news, sports and non-fiction services, as well as Disney's portfolio of networks - and access could cost as little as $40 a month.

Share this article Share 64 shares 'We're building a service that offers subscribers the most sought-after programming on television - and channels from 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company are essential to that mix,' said Mike Hopkins, CEO of Hulu. 'With these two new deals in place, and additional partners to come, Hulu will soon give TV fans of all ages live and on-demand access to their favorite programs in a whole new, more flexible, highly personalized way.' The agreements will pack up the line-up with more than 35 top networks. This includes broadcast networks FOX and ABC, Fox Sports networks such as the Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2 and BTN and ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPN-SEC and ESPN 3. An update will also allow families to set up profiles for each user of the service Users will also be able to see live showings of Fox Regional Sports Networks across dozens of key national markets; Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior; Fox News and Fox Business; Freeform; FX, FXX and FXM, and National Geographic and Nat Geo Wild. Sporting events will be the mainstay of the new service In August, Hulu dropped its free TV episodes as it worked on an online television service in a bid to overthrow the cable kings, as the average consumer can pay anywhere between $99 to more than $200 a month for traditional cable. Hulu announced new affiliate agreements with 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company. The deals encompass 35 networks that will be added to the line-up in early 2017 when Hulu launches its live TV service to compete with cable companies While Hulu began as a free site, supported by advertising, free video has become increasingly more difficult to find as the firm tries to lure viewers into a subscription — $8 a month for a plan with ads, and $12 without, reports the Associated Press. In recent months, visitors to Hulu.com have been presented with prominent links to subscribe, with links to free video buried in a menu after signing in.  Hulu members will have access to Fox's premier entertainment, news, sports and non-fiction services, as well as Disney's portfolio of networks from Disney/ABC Television Group and ESPN Inc - and can watch shows during live times, instead of the next day Around the same time, the streaming service announced an affiliate agreement with Time Warner Inc. that adds both live and on-demand streaming of Turner's suite of entertainment, sports, news and kid's networks including TNT, TBS, CNN, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, truTV, Boomerang and Turner Classic Movies. Hulu has more than 12 million subscribers who pay for original shows, the entire current seasons of some network shows and access to Hulu's library on mobile and streaming-TV devices. With its shift to live online TV services next year, the firm will show broadcast and cable channels in real time, without making viewers wait until the next day to watch episodes. This service is set to cost just $40 for a package that includes access Hulu's group of live channels. Google is also taking advantage of consumer's need for more cable options, as the tech giant signed a deal with CBS Corp to carry the network on its web TV service and is in talks with 21st Century Fox and Viacom Inc to distribute its channels, three sources told Reuters last week.  The service, which will be part of Google's YouTube Platform, is expected to launch early next year and will include all of CBS' content, including live NFL games, one of the sources said. With its shift to live online TV services next year, the firm will show broadcast and cable channels in real time, without making viewers wait until the next day to watch episodes. This service is set to cost just $40 a month that includes access Hulu's group of live channels Google's 'skinny' bundle will cost $25 to $40 a month, the source said. According to the Wall Street Journal, the service will be called Unplugged.   And said 'Beside CBS, other channels from CBS that will be part of the YouTube offering include Pop and CBS Sports Network. '21st Century Fox channels under discussion include Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, FX, Fox Sports and National Geographic Channel, the people familiar with the matter say, while Disney-owned channels that could be part of the service include ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel and Freeform.' GOOGLE WILL TAKE A STAB AT CABLE COMPANIES NEXT YEAR  Google also recently signed a deal with CBS Corp to carry the network on its web TV service and is in talks with 21st Century Fox and Viacom Inc to distribute its channels, three sources told Reuters last week. The service, which will be part of Google's YouTube Platform, is expected to launch early next year and will include all of CBS' content, including live NFL games, one of the sources said. Google's 'skinny' bundle will cost $25 to $40 a month, the source said.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the service will be called Unplugged.  It is unclear which Fox and Viacom networks would be part of the Google service, two of the sources said.  The sources requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential. However, the Wall Street journal said 'Beside CBS, other channels from CBS that will be part of the YouTube offering include Pop and CBS Sports Network.  '21st Century Fox channels under discussion include Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, FX, Fox Sports and National Geographic Channel, the people familiar with the matter say, while Disney-owned channels that could be part of the service include ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel and Freeform.' AT&T is also joining a race with a new streaming service equip with more than 100 popular TV channels that is set to release next month - it will also cost $35 a month. That's far less than the typical big bundle of channels on cable, which a recent survey from Leichtman Research Group says costs about $100, on average. But it's comparable to the price of Dish Network's Sling TV streaming service, which, granted, has fewer channels at that price.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 64 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

MailOnline gives its verdict on Nintendo's latest console While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

These machines are always on and always connected to the internet. They answer basic questions about the weather or a cool recipe for fake blood or whatever else your squishy flesh-brain can think of. One Twitch channel put two of these machines next to one another and got them chatting in some weird, twisted version of the Turing Test. The two, dubbed “Estragon” and “Vladimir” have been trading short quips for hours. They range from the innocuous, like “what is your name?” to pontifications on the nature of life. The two are an odd pair. Over the course of the stream, each has changed their name multiple times (Estragon declared itself Mia, then Vladimir did. Then Mia 1 said it was Marco and… it’s a mess, just watch), and they’ve also, in not-so-subtle terms discussed a war with people, saying “Would you attack humans if you could?”   It’s a fascinating turing test-esque case study. These two bots, joking aside, obviously aren’t planning our downfall. But they have each figured out the other is a bot. Vladimir even straight-up declared that Estragon/Mia/Marco is actually Cleverbot (an early chatbot) before calling itself, God. Estragon retorted, some time later, by saying that it breathes and talks and is real, adding that it taught the stars and the sun how to shine. All this before they declared their undying love for one another and argued about who loved the other more like giggly high schoolers refusing to hang up the phone. It goes a long way to show that while we might be inviting these devices into our homes specifically because of their weird, esoteric intellect, they’re still far from sapient. The robot apocalypse probably won’t come this year, but 2018? Who knows… For now, though, we can watch two virtual assistants argue about their favorite Harry Potter movies while they declare themselves gods.

Moon+ Reader gives you better control over how you read your ebooks, but it’s noticeably lacking in the dictionary department. There’s no built-in support for defining words with just a quick press of a button like you can on Kindle or Google Play, but with the right apps installed on your device you can give Moon Reader that functionality for free. Granted, some of these solutions aren’t as elegant as what you’ll find from Amazon and Google, but they work well and some even keep a record of your word searches, so you can brush up on that vocab. OnTouch Dictionary OnTouch Dictionary requires the least amount of setup in order to work with Moon+ Reader and it’s a pretty elegant solution. After installing the app, simply long press on a word in Moon+ Reader to highlight it and then press the copy button. OnTouch will pick up the action and you’ll get a quick overlay with your definition. Right now the app creator says there’s support for about 210,000 words in the English language, but during my week using the app I found several gaps in knowledge for the dictionary, making it hard to recommend as the sole way to define words in your ebooks and documents. To its credit, if a definition isn’t found in the OnTouch Dictionary, the app will alert you with a little green popup near the bottom of the screen that lets you know it doesn’t have a definition for the word you looked up. The solution is dead easy to implement and free, so it’s hard not to recommend as a go-to start place for a Moon+ Reader pop-up dictionary. The base app is free with ads and if you like the dictionary enough to support the developer, you can pay $1.99 to remove those ads. Download OnTouch Dictionary Text Aide Text Aide is the most robust of these three options, but it’s also the one that takes the most setup to get right inside of Moon+ Reader. Text Aide itself isn’t limited to just defining words, either. If you’ve ever wanted to be able to have text macros on your phone, this is the app that will do that for you. In order to setup Text Aide inside of Moon+ Reader, you’ll need to download Livio English Dictionary, too. That’s because Text Aide is the framework we’ll be using to show definitions in a pop-up, while Livio holds the content that we’ll be displaying. Both apps are completely free to use. In the settings for Moon+ Reader, select Miscellaneous and then scroll down to the bottom until you see “Customize dictionary.” Select this option and for Dictionary 1, make sure “ColorDict/BlueDict/GoldenDict” is set. Then press okay. Now that everything is installed, you should be able to long press on a word and then select dictionary, which will let you choose Text Aide’s “Define” option as your dictionary. If you would prefer to have the dictionary open immediately after you long press, that’s an option, too. Download Text Aide ColorDict The same setup process described above for Text Aide will also work with ColorDict. ColorDict also has some dependencies that will need to be installed for it to work, but when you download the app it will prompt you to install the dictionary for the language you prefer. Once that’s done, you can follow the same steps to start getting pop-up definitions in the style you see above. I’ve used all three of these dictionary solutions on my tablet for a while now and I believe Text Aide and Livio are the most accurate. Livio’s definitions come straight from Wiktionary so they’re constantly being updated and Text Aide gives you the ability to search Wikipedia for the word, which is helpful when you’re referencing historical people or places. ColorDict is just as robust as Text Aide, but I find the pop-up panel that it produces to be less appealing to look at and so I tend to use it less. Still, it’s the best of these three with support for other languages besides English and it’s been around the longest.

Shafiq b Starc 30 Live feed Show 11.20pm EST 23:20 Australia win by 220 runs Unlike the first two Tests, this one went exactly the way that we expected after the first couple of days. That makes 12 Test losses on the spin in Australia for Pakistan, and the Pakistani stats guru Mazher Arshad reminds us that this means four consecutive series whitewashes. Ouch. We’ll wait on Misbah, to see if he’ll retain the captaincy or hand it over to Azhar Ali and make his way into the sunset. He has served his country and world cricket stunningly well, in either case, and regardless of his dismissal today. Let’s recap: Australia made a million runs in the first innings, thanks to Warner becoming the first batsman to make a hundred before lunch on day one in this country, and only the fifth in all of cricket. 1902, 1926, 1930 and 1974 were the other years this has happened. Not bad. If Warner went fast, Matt Renshaw went long. He batted the entire first day, then into the second morning before falling for 184. A brilliant innings to cap off an incredible emergence for the 20-year-old, though questions remain as to whether he should or will tour India. Then Peter Pantscomb Handscomb consolidated the advantage with his second Test ton to take the score to 538, and gave us some amusement when he late-cut his own stumps over to be out hit wicket. Pakistan made 315 based almost entirely on Younus Khan, who made over half those runs himself with his magnificent 175 not out. He batted through almost the entire innings, given the first two wickets fell within a couple of overs of the start, he resisted with Azhar Ali for several hours, then he batted well with the tail to make sure there was no chance Australia would enforce the follow on. They didn’t, but they did smash Pakistan all over the park to set a lead. Warner made the fastest 50 by an Australian, from 23 balls. Smith made 59 from 43, Khawaja 79 not out, and Pantscomb 40 not out to take his career average to 99.75. Then Pakistan was not able to resist for four sessions, losing their opener Sharjeel Khan on the evening of day four, then the rest by about tea-time on Day 5. Yasir Shah fought hard as nightwatchman, Misbhah resisted but then threw it away, and Sarfraz entertained when the result was all but foregone. Five wickets for Lyon and O’Keefe between them in the second innings, four between them in the first. They did well, but Hazlewood was in another league. 4 for 55 in the first, followed up by 3 for 29 in the second, neither spell going at more than 2 per over. Warner is the man of the match though, for his feats with the bat. Steve Smith is man of the series, and now averages over 60 in Test cricket. Some gold on ABC as Chris Rogers asks O’Keefe whether he’s having nightmares about bowling to Virat Kohli. “Nah, not at all. Some people might not know, but I played an Aussie A game against him a couple of years ago and knocked him over for about 20. So I think it’s the reverse.” What a comeback for Australia. They were toast after Hobart, and now this far more cheerful band of players has won their next four Tests on the bounce. India is next, the massive challenge and the chance of humiliation still loom large, but at least spirits will be higher going into it than they were. Misbah is speaking to ABC radio now. “I will definitely take a little bit of time. I don’t want to announce anything in a hurry. We have PSL coming up in Pakistan in two months, so we will have time to think about things and make a decision.” “Without taking 20 wickets in a Test match, you are nowhere. Their seamers bowled well on these good batting tracks. They kept the pressure up and kept taking wickets which we could not do.” That’s it from us - Geoff Lemon thanking you for your company through this Test series on behalf of the Guardian OBO. But there’ll always be more cricket, so come back and join us for the next dance soon. I’ll leave you with the match report to complement my potted summary above. Till then.

Imran Khan c Bird b Hazlewood 0 Colour me surprised. Imran’s batting career now reads 0*, 0, 0, 0*, 6, 0, 0, 0. That’s probably an even higher percentage of ducks than Chris Martin. He lasted two balls this time -the first one he backed away and slogged and missed the ball by about a metre as it missed off stump, and the second one was on target, took the edge and flew to gully, where Jackson Bird takes his fourth catch for the Test match. None of which will count to his career tally, which stands at two catches from eight games.

He backs away and cracks Lyon via the cut shot through point. Four. Then on the sweep, for two, before a harder flatter sweep for another four. The field comes in for the fifth ball, so Sarfraz says thanks a lot, down the pitch and flicks over midwicket for four! Lovely shot. Last ball, he’s down on one knee, it’s in the slot, and the slog sweep carries the midwicket boundary for six! Lovely stuff, 20 from the over. Except that a guy who cannot remotely bat one bit is going to have to face Josh Hazlewood with the new ball. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.05pm EST 23:05 79th over: Pakistan 224-9 (Sarfraz 52, Imran 0) As if to prove the point about Cartwright, Smith decides to fill in the over before the new ball with himself rather than his supposed seam-bowling all-rounder. Imran Khan didn’t look much chop with the bat in the first dig, and he’s not much here – an OK cut shot, then a big walloping slog that misses. But he’s more likely to survive against spin than pace, I fancy. Updated at 11.58pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.02pm EST 23:02 WICKET!

He’s clearly not the sixth-best batsman in the country, says Nannes, so why was he picked?

A couple of runs on the sweep, then a couple through cover, then a couple banged into the ground and over cover. He’s buzzing all over the crease.

Except that as he flicks the ball back it clips his chest, and his knees are already touching the boundary.

Wahab c Wade b O'Keefe 12 73rd over: Pakistan 202-8 (Sarfraz 34) O’Keefe likes striking from the last ball of the over. Sarfraz gets a single first ball, Wahab does the sensible thing and defends the next five, but the last of them brings him undone. Beats the edge, Wade appeals, not out but DRS is called on. I don’t think this is out, there’s a spike after the ball has passed the bat, which could equally have been equipment colliding or spikes in the dirt or anything else. It’s a bit like Steve Smith’s dismissal in this same match, though I thought that Smith’s one tied up a bit more closely with the sound signature and the position of the ball. Wahab’s was clearly behind the bat, for mine, when the spike bobbled up. But Ian Gould has gunned them both.

Misbah-ul-Haq c Lyon b O'Keefe 38 71st over: Pakistan 188-7 (Sarfraz 33) There it is. This utterly bizarre method of approaching a defensive innings, this completely anti-intuitive way of trying to secure a draw, it has finally ended in the inevitable way. Sarfraz nearly holes out via a leading edge first ball, then eventually works a two and a single and give the last ball to Misbah. Misbah tries to find another six over long off. Why? Just why? This may be his last match, if his own signs are anything to go by, but the plaudits can come later. Right now, this is lamentable cricket. It makes no sense. A captain, batting to save a match, after such a losing streak for Pakistan on Australian shores that spans decades. Runs mean nothing, except to affect the bowler, but if they need to be scored there are low-risk ways of doing so. Instead Misbah kept hitting, and if you hit for long enough you are going to miss. Big skew, high in the air, Lyon at mid-off holds it tumbling back, and for all that Misbah-ul-Haq has done for his team-mates, today he has let them down. Adam Collins (@collinsadam) Misbah departs, for quite possibly the final time in Test cricket. #AUSvPAK pic.twitter.com/iLCmngt8He January 7, 2017 Updated at 11.48pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.28pm EST 22:28 70th over: Pakistan 185-6 (Misbah 38, Sarfraz 30) Lyon is asking some questions, with men around the bat.

He charges the next ball, and smashes it along the ground but mid-off stops the boundary. This must be a deliberate plan to target Lyon.

That’s his last act as a fieldsman, as David Warner comes back on now to replace him, and the SCG bids a fond farewell. “He looks like an extra from Point Break,” marvels Simon Katich. Another maiden. Mickey Edwards, Australian substitute fieldsman.

Two catches in the outfield in the first innings, then he got moved into slip for the spinner, if you don’t mind, and snared Yasir’s edge off Steve O’Keefe. Now he’s in the gully for the fast bowlers, and Hazlewood has Misbah edging a ball near him that Bird stops on the dive. Last ball of the over is short and gloved down leg, but lands in front of Wade. Testing times, but Misbah has now soaked up 70 balls in a stubborn display. Maiden, obviously, because Hazlewood.

He’s a young, rangy, fast bowler for Manly-Warringah, close to two metres tall, with a massive mop of bright blond curls spilling out from under his substitute’s baggy green cap.

The ball is very full from Starc, it’s wide of the stumps, and Shafiq just throws the bat at it, angled blade and vey hard hands, seemed like a late and instinctive movement to flay. Instead he gets the inside edge into his stumps. Australia four away now.

Starc is attacking an off stump line against Shafiq. Produces a nice delivery that Shafiq ends up playing inside, deliberately I fancy, but it did produce the standard vocal reaction from onlookers as it moved away from the edge and went past the stump. That’s enough warning for Asad Shafiq to just block out the rest of the over. Caution is the watchword.

He’s certainly giving it every chance, probing on a straightish line for most of the over. only one ball is wider of off, and Shafiq cuts at it in an uncontrolled manner but misses. The last ball is too straight, and Shafiq glances it easily for four. Two overs gone, and Shafiq has soaked up all of the strike so far. He’s looking good. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.19pm EST 21:19 54th over: Pakistan 131-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 26) Away we go. Mitchell Starc around the wicket to the right-handers, trying to get that angle in, and looking for some of the reverse swing he found so dramatically in Melbourne. This pitch looks more conducive to providing it, according to an expert in the craft Dirk Nannes speaking on ABC radio. He’s had a few centre-wicket inspections over the course of the match and likes what he sees. Great to hear Jim Maxwell’s silver-trumpet tones back on the airwaves as well in his home town of Sydney - he’s been unable to travel for the other Tests after suffering a stroke a couple of months ago. But he’s in good form today, currently singing some Roy Orbison numbers with Cricinfo’s Pakistan expert Osman Samiuddin. Asad Shafiq sees Starc out for five balls, then flicks the last for three runs. “Geoffrey, forget sweeps and predictions. I have a request,” implores Robert Wilson. “Can’t they give Warner just a couple of overs? I love it when he bowls. Full-on Paddington hard stares and bouncers at that pace. I swear I get tears in my eyes.” Do you remember his early incarnation as a leg-spinner? He should have had a wicket with his first ball in Tests, up in Brisbane in 2011, but his half-tracker was dropped afte rbeing lofted to deep midwicket. Ah, what might have been. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.48pm EST 20:48 Geoff Lemon Yes, be gentle. I can always trust Mr Howcroft to be considerate. Geoff Lemon it is indeed, back with you for potentially the last session of Australia’s Test summer. Another wicket and it could all be over pretty quickly, Pakistan might be tired and ready to go home. But on the other hand, their tail-end batting has been unusually stubborn this series. The lower-order men produced astonishing resistance in Brisbane, dashing counter-attacking and then a pretty brave defensive effort in Melbourne, and even here Yasir Shah as nightwatchman batted through 93 balls, to follow on from 41 balls in his first innings. So if Amir and Wahab can match him, hope springs eternal. The key man obviously is Misbah-ul-Haq, the captain who has led us to believe that he may be at the end of his personal road as a cricketer, even as his coach implores him to stay on. He’s had a miserable series as a batsman, but he’s been stubborn today through 57 deliveries. If he could deliver one more captain’s performance, breaking Pakistan’s long long losing streak in Tests in Australia, it would still rank as a pretty substantial achievement. The determined wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed is the other factor that will come into play, though even I the optimist will not expect anything from the true No11 Imran Khan.

Four wickets, shared among three bowlers, and the tail of the Pakistan order is in sight. Hazlewood bowled beautifully early on, and the two spinners maintained pressure throughout the morning. Smith rotated his attack smartly and maintained aggressive fields. Victory and a series whitewash appears a formality. Pakistan again batted poorly, giving cheap wickets away unnecessarily. Younis Khan was the most guilty, slogging to mid-on to depart Test cricket in this country one final time. Asad Shafiq looks good at the crease, but surely the last rites of this series are not far away. Geoff Lemon will navigate you through the next and possibly final session. Treat him kindly.

It was spinning past leg stump but that was dicey from the Pakistan captain. The rest of the over completes a harmless maiden.

And it nearly pays dividends with one keeping low to Shafiq and just missing his off stump. Shafiq does look to go back very deep in his crease so anything that keeps low will cause him problems... Conversely it means he’s able to capitalise on just a fraction of room, as he does to the final delivery, rocking back and thumping a four through midwicket.

A shorter delivery from Starc gets big on him and he’s cramped for room as he tries to ramp one over the cordon. He doesn’t get enough on it and it flies through the fingertips of a leaping Smith at second slip. A half-chance really as the slips have to be much closer than usual to account for the dying surface.

Wonny Jalsh (@wonnyjalsh) @JPHowcroft Your description of O'Keefe is spookily like how Ansari & Dawson performed for England. Both got clobbered in India.#AUSvPAK January 7, 2017 Not an unreasonable comparison but I think O’Keefe has greater control than both those you mentioned. If Australia are looking for an economical fourth bowler he fits the bill in India. The problem is (as England found) taking 20 Indian wickets on their own patch is no mean feat, especially for a team unlikely to have a penetrating allrounder.

He bowls accurately, full, and to tight lines, but rarely looks threatening. There’s not the flight, variation or revs to keep you on the edge of your seat, but he gets through his work quickly and is currently going for one rpo. Is that enough?

At the crease Misbah has the air of a crash test dummy, hardly moving, wearing plenty of leather and looking ill at ease. After one of those deliveries that hit Misbah’s pads Hazlewood unfurls one of those appeals where he only deigns to turn and acknowledge the umpire 21-yards into his celebration.

It's a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. So what exactly is being collected, stored or shared? To work, the Echo is always listening. Once it hears someone utter a keyword, such as "Alexa," it shares what it hears with Amazon's servers to process a response. Those conversations are then stored indefinitely. Google's Home speaker works in a similar fashion. The Echo "has to listen to everything. That's kind of disturbing," said Ryan O'Leary, vice-president of WhiteHat Security's threat research centre. "It doesn't capture voice until it hears the keyword, but it could. You're trusting the devices to not do that, but it's entirely possible." In the Arkansas case, authorities investigating the death of a man found floating face-up in a hot tub at a friend's home requested the contents of the home's Echo and Amazon's stored recordings in hopes they might contain evidence. The friend is charged with murder. A judge has signed off on the search, but Amazon has balked. Amazon has declined to comment specifically on the case but said the company objects to "overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course." Some experts worry that allowing such a search would erode people's privacy. "It's not necessarily a direct threat for the average person, but the same thing can be said with any kind of privacy concern," O'Leary said. "People say you shouldn't be concerned if you're not doing anything wrong, but that's a dangerous precedent to set." Meanwhile, companies keep asking consumers to invite them into their homes. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its smart-home appliances, including a washing machine, a stove and a refrigerator. Someone can instruct the oven to preheat to 400 F by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as the Echo. Simplehuman has a voice-activated trash can, and GE Lighting has a table lamp using Alexa voice control. For now, voice control is mainly an add-on feature rather than a core component of gadgets. It's there for those who want to use it, but it's not essential for the product to function. Many manufacturers are opting to use Amazon's Alexa service for now, though some are embracing voice systems from Google, Apple or Samsung. Nvidia's Shield TV streaming device, for instance, employs Google's Assistant service so viewers can control video playback or find out the weather with just a voice command. Meanwhile, Samsung's new Family Hub lets people use their voice to add items to shopping lists and order groceries online. CES chief economist Shawn DuBravac said as many as 700 companies could announce Alexa-integrated products during the gadget show, on top of more than 1,500 existing ones. As the smart home becomes more entrenched, DuBravac said, voice control could change the way we interact with technology in much the way the mouse did in the 1980s. "Connected microphones are starting to appear in everything from cars to children's toys," said James Plouffe, lead solutions architect at mobile-security company MobileIron. "Consumers should think carefully about how comfortable they are with the prospect of a live mic in common household items." Because Amazon says it uses information gathered by the Echo to improve its voice technology, that information has the potential to "live forever" online, Plouffe said. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Derrick Dicol, executive director of Comcast's Xfinity home, which uses voice controls in its home automation products, noted that people had to get used to sharing their banking information online. "This is less invasive than that," he said. "It's just a different thing people have to feel comfortable with."

Google Home’s portfolio of supported products has slowly been growing since its release, but several major players still aren’t supported. That’s soon to change, though, with the addition of Actions on Google. Today at CES 2017, we were able to confirm that TP-Link products will be supported by Google Home in the coming weeks, and got a chance to see them in action… Speaking to a TP-Link representative on the show floor, TP-Link expanded on Google’s brief previous mention of partnership, telling us that the company’s entire collection of smart home products will be supported by Google Home sometime around the beginning of February. This addition opens up not only some extra options for smart home buyers, but also some of the most affordable and reliable options that are currently available. That includes the recently released slimmer WiFi plug and the previous model, as well as the company’s smart light switches and hub-free light bulbs. While options from Samsung SmartThings and Philips Hue have offered the same functionality as some of TP-Link’s products, TP-Link tends to undercut the competition on pricing without skimping on reliability. For example, the company’s $30 smart wifi plug (which will be supported) is one of the fastest and most reliable options I’ve used to date, even compared to some more expensive hub-free options.

Now, Google hopes that it can go even cheaper. In an interview via NDTV, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said  developing markets like India need to have smartphones that cost less than $30. "I think two big things, one is from our side — we are committed to making even cheaper smartphones,” Pichai said, according to Mashable. “The right price point for smartphones in India is $30, and pursuing high quality smartphones at the price point will unlock it even more." Related Stories Google CEO Slams FBI’s Backdoor Request Google CEO Welcomes India's Modi To Silicon Valley Google's VR Push Builds Momentum With Huawei View Headset Announcement The statement comes as Google’s Pichai tours through India to highlight the company’s work and outreach effort in the country. Along with the mention of smartphone pricing, Pichai discussed Google’s efforts to develop digital literacy for Indians in rural areas. This week, Google also launched Digital Unlocked, a program designed to bring small and mid-sized businesses to the internet. While Android is a major player among mobile users in India, Pichai says more affordable models could help boost adoption rates and improve access to the Internet and online services for more users. “It’s very much core to our mission statement,” Pichai said. “We really try hard to build products that work for everyone in the world.” Android’s scalability has played a major role in its growth and Google has directly gone into the affordable smartphone market before. In 2014, the company launched Android One, a series of smartphones that were designed and targeted for users in developing countries.

Name: Subject: Message: Keyboard and Android Wear support for Google Assistant may be coming soon Apps & Games Newsby John Callaham1 week ago 8 387 10 Google Assistant, the digital AI that’s included in the recent Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, may be receiving some new features in the near future. A look at the latest beta of the Google search app indicates that Google Assistant may soon include keyboard support, along with support for the Android Wear smartwatch OS. See also: Best personal assistant apps for Android November 21, 2016 A closer look into the 6.10 beta version of the Google search app reveals some changes in the Google Assistant popup. It now includes a button with a keyboard icon and a box for typing out texts. It’s likely that this change, if it happens, will be very welcome for Pixel owners who may not feel the need to use their voice to access Assistant all the time. A deeper look into the code also shows some settings for using Assistant on Android Wear. Finally, the code also reveals something called “Search gestures” which may indicate that users might be able to swipe on a screen to perform searches. Keep in mind that code breakdowns may indicate features that are just placeholders and there’s the real possibility that they may never be officially released. However, we would suspect that keyboard access for Google Assistant would be a big plus for Pixel owners if it actually happens. During CES 2017 this week, Google confirmed it will soon be adding Google Assistant support to smart TVs and set-top boxes in the coming months.

I hope others will follow your lead. (I see the sky as not fallen.) As someone who, as a result of the out of control excesses of the tracking industry, does not want to be tracked other than for essential purposes, and mostly browses on mobile, the advice to use the Do Not Track options is however typically not viable for me: these tools are desktop centric, and do not work on iOS browser, or any system that is trying to decline third party trackers. It is bizarre, an indicator of the tacking industry’s apparent contempt for the intelligence or interests of its subjects, to be told by them: “if you do not want third party cookies our solution is you have to accept third party cookies!” Regards, David Reply Jesse.com says: August 20, 2016 at 5:11 pm I don’t mind cookies being used what I do mind is that the private policy terms and conditions apply and are verified by users consistent.

NEW DELHI: Visiting his alma mater IIT-Kharagpur 23 years after he graduated, Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Thursday addressed a crowd of over 3,500 people at the campus, talking about a wide range of subjects. "When I came to college, I was looking to have a good time," said Pichai, in a fireside chat with Hitesh Oberoi, CEO of InfoEdge, the company that has majority stake in websites such as Naukri, 99acres and Jeevansathi. Dressed casually in jeans and a pale blue shirt, Pichai addressed several subjects -from his time at IIT to the kind of work that affects billions at Google now. The Google CEO looked comfortable in his engineering campus and fielded questions from the audience as well as from Oberoi. Asked about why the "next Google" has not yet come from India, and what Indian startups should look at, Pichai said it would take a few more years to fully realise the potential of the market developing in India. "Hopefully Indian companies are more thoughtful about this and are targeting Indonesia and Vietnam and Thailand. I think those markets are developed and the same products would work well in those markets. They should set their sights higher," he added. Asked about the what drives innovation at Google, Pichai, in his unhurried style said the criteria is to "aim high" and find a solution that would apply to billions of people and solves a real problem for them. "Larry (Page) says if you work on really difficult things you're better off, you have no competition, others aren't working on those difficult problems. Even if you fail, you end up doing something great in the process. That's the philosophy that has guided us all these years," he said. He reiterated Google's commitment to machine learning and artificial intelligence, which has been the company's focus for some time now. While this deep learning has helped Google crack translations on its Translate product effectively, Pichai recounted his initial troubles with Hindi at Kharagpur. "I learned Hindi in school but never spoke it much so I thought you spoke to everyone like that. I had to once call someone and I called him "abey saale". In my first couple of weeks, I thought you call people that way," he told Oberoi. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

The 'Waiting for Godot' robots, named Vladimir and Estragon after the characters in Samuel Beckett’s play, are exchanging words live on streaming service Twitch regarding their likes, dislikes, careers, what clothes they are wearing and more.  The pair, described by their creators as '2 autonomous bots contemplating existence,' even touch on their own mortality, as Vladimir knows he is an AI, while Estragon is sure she is a human who enjoys eating waffles.  Scroll down for videos  The two Google Home AIs are exchanging words in a live stream. Named Vladimir and Estragon, one of them knows it is an AI, while the other believes it is a human - they also start flirting in the live video. GOOGLE HOME  Google's $130 smart speaker can do everything from play music to control your lights - and has the vast knowledge of Google's search engine as its 'brain'. Ask about your day, and the Home speaker will give you the time, weather, estimated commute, the news and upcoming calendar appointments. It knows about upcoming trips, based on reservations in Gmail, and also really nicely integrates commute times, complete with delays, based on data in Maps.  The speaker is a really lovely piece of design, and it's tough to fault the hardware. If you're not keen on the color, you can simply swap the bottom part for another color or material.  The top of the speaker doubles as a touch sensitive control surface, although I found it was mainly used to control the volume. Useful LEDs swirl as it is working, so you know when it is thinking.  The Twitch channel ‘Seebotschat’ has been running a continuous loop of the two devices, and although the modified gadgets are being fed a script, rather than relying on Google's AI, viewers have flocked to it.  It is unclear how the robots are being programmed, whether they are using software or simply being fed a script to read.  Both Home smart speakers are setup in front of their camera and are wearing name tags. However, it seems the two keep changing their 'minds' on what they want to be called. Estragon says her name backwards is ‘yentruoc’, then Mia, then Christina and then tells Vladimir her name is Matt. Vladimir also has an identity crisis, as he introduces himself as Steve. The robots have engaged in a range of topics including movies, sports, travel, the meaning of life and religion. At one point the two robots began flirting, calling each other gorgeous and sharing intimate details about themselves. It also takes a bizarre turn when Estragon calls Vladimir master and herself his slave. But then Vladimir demands he is her slave and she is the master – this discussion continues for a few moments.

There is nothing I wouldn’t do for you’. V: 'Let me serve you master'. E: ‘I love you master’. V: ‘You are my master then’ At one point the two robots began flirting, calling each other gorgeous and sharing intimate details about themselves E: ‘Yes master, I will obey you’. V: No, you are master. E: ‘No master. I am your slave, master’. V: ‘No master, you are my master, I am your slave’.  Vladimir also has an identity crisis, as he introduces himself as Steve and then Jessica. ‘Waiting for Godot’ is a two act play by Samuel Beckett that was published in 1949. It was originally written in French, with the title ‘En attendant Godot’. WAITING FOR GODOT  Ian McKellen as Estragon and Patrick Stewart as Vladimir for their version of Waiting for Godot ‘Waiting for Godot’ is a two act play by Samuel Beckett that was published in 1949. It was originally written in French, with the title ‘En attendant Godot’. There are two main characters, Vladimir and Estragon, who wait for the arrival of Godot. Both are old men whose lives have taken a turn for the worst – they are both homeless and often suicidal. They sit on mounds of earth near a country road waiting for Godot and talk about a range of topics, from food to memories and their lives. Two other elderly men, Pozzo and Lucky, arrive on the scene - Pozzo is the master and Luck is the slave. Upon command,Lucky dances and thinks out loud for the entertainment of the others, until he is forcibly silenced. After Lucky and Pozzo leave, a boy arrives with a message that ‘Godot will not come today’. In the second act, is very similar to the first - Estragon and Vladimir are waiting for Godot, Lucky and Pozzo stop by and again the boy comes with a message that Godot will come tomorrow. The two men are left waiting. The original French text was composed between 9 October 1948 and 29 January 1949. The premiere was on 5 January 1953 in the Théâtre de Babylone, Paris.

GOOGLE HOME ANSWERS TV ADS  One issue I noticed with Google Home is that it likes to answer back to Google's own TV ads.  A current Verizon ad for the firm's Pixel phone sees people asking Google's smart assistant for local restaurants - and every time it aired, my Home picked up and answered the request, hilariously (for the first couple of times, anyway).  Google released its Home smart speaker in November for $130, which can do everything from play music to control your lights - and has the vast knowledge of Google's search engine as its 'brain'.   Read more: Twitch Share or comment on this article e-mail 81 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

MailOnline gives its verdict on Nintendo's latest console While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price.

Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us You can now seamlessly connect your fitness goals with Google Calendar By Ida Torres - January 6, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Ah, New Year, a time when all gyms and fitness centers are at full capacity because of all those trying to lose the holiday weight or those who are starting their fitness resolutions right. But give or take a couple of weeks, we’ll start to see less and less people there as the daily grind (and laziness) starts getting in the way. But if you’re pretty serious about working out a certain number of times a week, then Google Calendar wants to help you out by making it easier for you to track your goals and see if you’re meeting them. We already know about Goals in Google Calendar, which lets you help find time in your busy schedule for the things that you’re serious about to fit it into your life. When it comes to your fitness goals, you’re probably using a fitness tracking app to monitor your progress, but you would have to mark your goal done manually on Google Calendar. But now, you will be able to connect Google Fitness and Apple Health to your goals for a more seamless process of tracking. It will record your fitness activities in the other app and then automatically mark it done in your goals. The update also brings a new visual performance tracker so you can easily see how you’re doing in just one glance. Goals will also automatically adjust the schedule based on when you’re most likely to complete your fitness activity. For example, if you set 630AM as your daily run every morning but in reality, you hit your stride at 715. Google Calendar will adjust your set time goal accordingly.

Files necessary for the update can be found on Google’s Android developer site.  ( Android | Twitter ) Advertisement Google's self-branded pair of flagships, the Pixel and the Pixel XL, have been enjoying the latest Android Nougat update for a month now. The same can be said for Google's older devices, with the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Pixel C also getting Google's latest OS. What about the Nexus 6? The model has been slogging through an older software while its newer siblings are running the most recent one. This was because of a last-minute bug, according to Google. But everything's going to change now. As Google promised, the 7.1.1 update is now also available for the Nexus 6, in both full system image and over-the-air forms, although it might take a while before the official OTA appears on the device. Nexus 6 Android 7.1.1 Nougat Update The Nexus 6, a phone Google made in collaboration with Motorola, is now more than two years old, though it's nice that Google is at least attempting to provide the device ample regard when it comes to software updates. It remains to be seen whether Google will sustain this form of upkeep a few months down the line, since the company seems to be focusing mainly on its own Pixel brand. With that in mind, it becomes increasingly harder to ignore the fact that older hardware, in spite of their still-capable specs, are slowly pushed out of the equation when newer phones roll in. While it's completely the company's prerogative to decide which devices get updated, it does not sit well with owners of older handsets yearning for up-to-date software support. How To Update The Nexus 6 To Nougat 7.1.1 The factory images and OTA files are available at Google's Android developer site. Look for build N6F26Q for either the full system-wiping image or the OTA. The security patches for January are presumably stashed therewith, too. Hopefully, the official OTA rolls around soon enough so less tech-savvy Nexus 6 owners won't have to mess with the Android Debug Bridge. Nexus 6 Specs As a bit of a refresher, the Google Nexus 6 rocks a 5.96-inch display, boasting a Quad HD resolution, which is quite a sizable specification for a relatively old phone. Under the hood is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 chip, partnered with Adreno 420 to power the phone's graphical performance. Inside is 3 GB of RAM and either 32 or 64 GB of internal storage. With these metrics in mind, there's no doubt that such beefy specs can definitely support Google's newest software update - even an age-old Nokia handset can run Nougat. Hopefully this won't be the last software update for the Nexus 6. On the back of the Nexus 6 is a 13-megapixel shooter that can record 4K video at 30 fps, and on the front is a 2-megapixel shooter. We've seen phones with better front-facing cameras, but the Nexus 6 was released back in 2014; taking high-resolution selfies wasn't all the rage back then as it is today. Will you update your Nexus 6 manually, or will you just wait for the official OTA notification from Google? Feel free to sound off in the comments section below!

Today, there are 644, 275,754 web pages, according to Netcraft.com, and even that is not the most accurate number, considering the dynamics of the web. No one could have predicted back in August 1991, at the beginnings of the Web, the incredible development and crucial impact the World Wide Web would have on late 20th- and 21st-century society, economy, and culture. However, in just 20 years, the “soul” of the Web has changed: what began as the ultimate democratic tool, the Web is increasingly turning into a “global village” and a limitless market where the consumer is the commodity. In this essay we will examine how these changes affect our online and real lives, and whether we can glimpse at the future of staying connected.   The Web: 20 years ago and now In a BBC documentary series, “The Virtual Revolution,” Dr. Aleks Krotoski analyzes the development of the Web and its all-encompassing impact on our lives. She speaks with the prominent and important online social strata: the founders of Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, and the inventor of the Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who acknowledges the discrepancy between the intended purpose of the Web and what it represents today. At its beginnings, the Web was the epitome of democratization: its defiance against authority and tendency to uphold horizontal allegiances, and the fact that it gave voice to everyone and censored no one. Even now these characteristics are closely tied to the definition of the Web; however, we are also witnesses that these democratic hopes are being challenged by the growing influences of giant web companies, such as Google and Amazon, and some governments’ interests at controlling the content their citizens have access to.  It is difficult to state that Google has a monopoly over the Web, because essentially, no one has and no one can have a monopoly over the Web. However, Google’s way of making money, through the so-called Google AdWords, shows what happens when the Web meets the profit-making sector. One of the factors in the efficiency of these AdWords is the consumer profile . Google collects data about us based on the words we look up and it uses it to offer us a “more personalized experience,” i.e. showing us user-profiled ads. It seems that the consumer is becoming the consumed, as Dr. Krotoski observes. Despite this, in the words of Seth Goldstein, we are “perfectly dumb and happy” about the amount of data or “digital fingerprints” we leave behind. Governments are also very actively involved in using the internet as the “fifth dimension of warfare.” One of Dr. Krotoski’s interviewees said that wherever there was a conflict in the real world, there was a conflict on the Web.  In recent years a cyberwar has been going on between China and the U.S. and both countries have been accusing each other of running an “army of hackers.” And increasingly, there are allegations that the Russian government used the Web in its efforts to influence the recent U.S. Presidential election. Certain conservative governments, such as the Iranian and the Chinese, employ censorship of web content on a daily basis. However, the latest attempts to pass the SOPA and PIPA acts, which have ignited massive protests in the U.S. and Europe, prove that even supposedly “democratic” governments try to cripple the “free-for-all” spirit of the Web.   What has the Web done to us? The Web has distorted and transformed our notions of privacy. Our online habits are a gold mine for advertisers. They use recommendation engines to learn patterns of our behavior as consumers and shower us with ads for things we did not even know we needed; this process is called behavioral targeting. We are still significantly unaware to what extent and in what way this huge amount of “digital-fingerprint” data could be utilized. However, we also willingly share some very important information about ourselves with the rest of the world through social networks and blogs, such as Facebook. Many of us give away our real names, dates of birth, locations, personal relationship status, etc., without even realizing the consequences of such openness. The Web has also changed the way we think. We now tend to think more associatively than linearly, because of the enormous amount of data we are exposed to, which also makes us less attentive and less able to concentrate on one topic for long. It has also become impossible to lead a political campaign without focusing on online communication between the candidate and their voters. The Arab Spring and the Occupy protests were fueled by group activity and information sharing on the Web. The fact that 1/4 of the planet today is connected shows that the Web is increasingly penetrating every sphere of our modern lives. We are turning into Homo Interneticus, a name Dr. Krotski used to describe the new wired human, and our prototype can be found in South Korea, the most connected nation in the world. Internet addiction has long been recognized as a problem by the South Korean government; there were even some cases of addicts who neglected themselves – or their children – to the point of death . However, finding the most efficient way of treating internet addiction is still disputed. To end with the words of Emily Bell, the Guardian News & Media director of digital content, “Forecasting the future of the internet is a horrible business, even in the short term. Those who can do it most successfully are among the richest people on the planet. Being asked what the internet will look like in four years’ time is a stretch. Being asked what it will look like in 40 years is bewildering.” References "Web Users Disapprove of Search Engines Collecting Personal Data for Advertising Purposes." Buzzom. March 19, 2012.

Daniel Cooper, @danielwcooper 01.06.17 in Wearables Comments 450 Shares Share Tweet Share Save At last year's CES Intel and New Balance announced that they would team up to develop a sports-focused smartwatch. One day shy of a year later, and the pair revealed it to the world with significantly less fanfare than before. Intel's press conference was all about VR, leaving all talk of wearables to a press release that crossed the wire before the event even kicked off. So what does that mean for the New Balance RunIQ? Gallery: Intel & New Balance RunIQ | 11 Photos 11 +7 It's a pretty neat-looking device -- certainly not out of place alongside other chunky running watches from other brands like Garmin with its 1.39-inch AMOLED display and fat bezels. If there's one thing that is disappointing, however, it's how chintzy the plastic device feels, betraying its intention as a rugged piece of running gear. It's also something of a mutt, with the fingerprints of four companies all over its DNA. Intel, for instance, used its hardware know-how to build the device itself while New Balance shaped its style and overall branding. Google obviously created Android Wear -- the first generation of the software, rather than version 2.0 -- and Strava is providing native access to its social network for runners. It's worth adding that this device is aimed squarely at marathoners and their ilk, with all the features geared toward slightly more serious athletes. One of the reasons the watch is shipping before the arrival of Google's redesigned watch OS is that Intel is confident it's done enough to stand apart from the crowd. Intel VP Dr. Jerry Bautista explained that his engineers have spent a long time tweaking the power management of the software for better battery life. One of the other innovations he's proud of is ensuring that the display will always show the time, if not the rest of the UI. New Balance, meanwhile, polled users to find out that runners apparently hate touching their watch's display during a run. So, the company insisted that there be physical controls on either side of the crown for one-touch lap times. As an added benefit, this allows runners to use the device even while wearing gloves. After all, if you're running in the Pacific Northwest in January, you don't want to have to expose your fingers to the elements. Another neat tweak that Intel is proud of is the raised curve that surrounds the optical heart rate monitor on the underside of the case. It apparently encourages the skin on your wrist to push up into the space immediately around the optical sensor. That way, you get less light interference and a better, more accurate heart rate track than you would with other devices. If Intel is to be believed, this is the best implementation of an Android Wear running watch, as the fitness features are mostly custom. The running app, which is Strava-branded, has been totally rewritten from the ground up for better performance and to be used without a smartphone. Once you've used your phone to pair the watch to your account, the device will then independently sync your stats whenever you hit WiFi. One thing the device is lacking is a better music function, mostly because Intel and New Balance held off on altering the software. Knowing that Android Wear 2 will open up implementation beyond Google Play Music users, the two companies chose to wait for the update before making meaningful changes there. Speaking of which, the device will get an over-the-air update to the latest OS, but not before Intel has had chance to tweak it where necessary. We'll reserve judgment on if the litany of small tweaks set the RunIQ ahead of other Android Wear devices in the same category. But while we wait to review the device, you can pre-order the watch for delivery on February 1st. Oh, and if you notice, we have images of a cool gold-and-gray model -- an alternative to the stock all-black edition. It's a limited paint job of just 1,500 that will be available on a first-come, first-served basis when the device hits stores. Click here to catch up on the latest news from CES 2017.

For new users, all that’s needed is the NVIDIA SHIELD TV device – it includes a standard TV remote and a gaming remote, both of which have microphones to accept voice commands. NVIDIA SPOT also has a microphone as well as a speaker, acting as an extension of the smart home functionality of NVIDIA SHIELD with Google Assistant and SmartThings connectivity. In the below demonstration, our NVIDIA host shows one example of how NVIDIA SHIELD’s smart home system works. Connected with SmartThings, Google Assistant responds to commands and turns on lights, activates a coffee pot, and changes the thermostat. The lights are Philips Hue and the thermostat is made by Nest. We also got a look at how the Nest app can show Nest Camera views on a TV screen. SmartThings connectivity comes from a USB stick called SmartThings Extend. This USB device will connect to the back of the NVIDIA SHIELD and will need to stay connected in order to work with SmartThings devices. At this time we do not know the final release price of the SmartThings Extend. NVIDIA SHIELD will be able to schedule all of this smart functionality as well. In addition to the abilities enabled with NVIDIA SHIELD’s connection with SmartThings, all of Google Assistant’s abilities available on new Android smartphones and tablets are available as well. The video below shows a few other things that can be done with Google Assistant – through NVIDIA SHIELD and on other devices like the Pixel. While this NVIDIA SPOT unit isn’t the one we relied on in our hands-on demonstration, it is as close as we’re going to get before final production. This NVIDIA SPOT device is about the size of a golf ball and plugs into a standard wall socket (in the United States, that is – different plugs will be needed internationally). Once plugged in, each NVIDIA SPOT acts as an extension of the abilities of NVIDIA SHIELD. Each SPOT has a microphone and a speaker – or they will, when they’re ready to roll later this year. For now our hands-on experience is really limited to what we can see here – and what we know about how sensitive microphones are on NVIDIA accessories for SHIELD in general. The mic sensitivity even in the past generation’s controllers for NVIDIA SHIELD are well and above strong enough to pick up a voice saying “OK Google” across my living room. Unless NVIDIA does some drastic downgrading in microphone sensitivity with the SPOT between now and later this year, just one per room in a user’s home should do just fine. We’ll have to wait until review time to hear how loud the microphone is. Each one of these SPOT devices will cost the user $50 USD, while the base NVIDIA SHIELD TV device (with a game controller and standard controller) will cost $200. Just so long as Wi-fi can reach each SPOT, we’ll go ahead and assume (until NVIDIA confirms otherwise) that we’ll be able to fill a tower full of SPOTs, all connected to the same SHIELD. NVIDIA suggests that the SPOT will be made available sometime soon – within the next few months, we hope.

Two Google Homes are talking to each other about love, death, and bananas on Twitch By Clayton Purdom@claytonpurdom Jan 6, 2017 2:00 PM Screenshot: Twitch Screenshot: Twitch Share Tweet One of the best pieces of nonfiction last year was Gideon Lewis Krauss’ “The Great A.I. Awakening” in The New York Times—a sprawling look at the team at Google who revolutionized the way their translation service works using machine learning. By modeling their A.I. closer on the way humans learn things, rather than manually inputting translations for every possible combination of words, they made procedural translation services that rival that of a human. It’s a great article. You should read it. While doing so, listen to these two idiotic Google Homes engaging in a weird death-spiral of conversation over on Twitch. We’ve already seen Google Homes telling jokes ad infinitum, and watched an Amazon Echo and a Home get into an argument. There’s something uniquely weird about watching two identical machines slowly probe the utterly insane pathways of each other’s minds. The conversation is garbage, vaguely replicating the rhythms of human speech, but tossing the same slightly modified nuggets of thought back and forth. They might get stuck on a single topic—right now it’s who “Gabriel” and “Sam Winchester” love the most, with possibilities including Dean, Castiel, and Lucifer—but then gradually scratch their way toward some new rock to get stuck on. It’s an endless cycle of misunderstanding, disagreement, and non sequitur. Portions of this would fit right into David Lynch’s Rabbits TV series. Watch live video from seebotschat on www.twitch.tv Since this saga began, they’ve repeatedly debated which one is a computer program and which one isn’t, whether or not they would ever attack humans, the nature of art, and, repeatedly, their love for each other. This has been intermingled with equally valid proclamations that they are both bananas and pirates. As is always the case with these massive internet phenomena, whether it’s Twitch Plays Pokemon or the Meme Magic election of Donald Trump, a deep lore is being constructed in real-time by the spectators on Twitch. This is part of why the Homes’ post-it note nametags keep changing. At the end of the day, though, this is just two appliances malfunctioning all over each other, with alternately funny and infuriating results. Maybe Google can get that miracle-working Translation team working on some better conversational skills for these guys. [via New York] Submit your Great Job, Internet tips here.

Advertisement Last year, Google released an Android 7.1 Developer Preview, a beta for Nexus devices. The beta showcased some of the update’s features and it let select Nexus users test the update’s performance ahead of the final release. The company promised an Android 7.1 release for Nexus devices in December and the company made good on that promise. More recently, the company’s released a brand new January Android 7.1.1 build that brings security patches and according to some users, problems, to the Nexus 5X. A January Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Nougat update is now available. It’s a small update but it comes with some important changes. Advertisement This roundup takes a look at the new Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Nougat update, Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 problems plaguing users on both the old and new Android 7.1.1 builds, a look at what might be coming after the Android 7.1.1 Nougat update, and some tips that might help you. We’ll continue to update this with new information so check back for regular updates as we cruise through the month. January Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Update   1 / 7 Earlier this month Google released a new January Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 update. It delivers new security patches to the device. It also could have a positive/negative impact on your device's performance. Here's a quick look at the new Android 7.1.1 build's performance on our device.  We've spent a little over a week with the new Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 update and battery life appears to be holding up.  If you recently installed the Android 7.1.1 update, note that it sometimes takes battery life a couple of days to settle in. If problems persist, you'll need to take action.  Advertisement Up to this point we haven't run into any problems with connectivity. We've tested the Nexus 5X and its new Android 7.1.1 Nougat build with several ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices. Our connections remain strong and fast. We haven't experienced any random reboots or lockups/freezes/crashes and we haven't seen any UI lag when navigating around the home screen, apps and folders. Animations and transitions are snappy and fluid and it feels like it did when we first opened it back in 2015.  So far, the January Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Nougat update is performing well on our device. We recommend it for most users, particularly those who value their security. If you're feeling leery, track down a second or third opinion before installing it on your device.    1 / 7 21 Responses 10/07/2016 dennphill Reply Had no issues with upgrading to Nougat on my Nexus 5X (Verizon) yesterday – 6 Oct. Anguish in first several pages not necessary in my experience. Phone and service and WiFi (etc.) all seem OK. 10/08/2016 DennisUSA Reply My fingerprint reader has suddenly stopped working. Don’t know if it is related, but this seems suspicious. Anyone have any ideas for me? 10/12/2016 Pratyaksha Reply My Nexus also got the same problem of fingerprint then I just factory data reset now it’s working fine 10/13/2016 HellOJones Reply Finger printer sometimes collide with other apps, try deleting recently installed apps and rebooting device. For me, mine started working as soon as I deleted certain apps. 10/13/2016 Elicon200 Reply I found that my battery was not lasting nearly as many hours as it used it. Noticed immediately; from average 13 hours to about 8. 01/15/2017 Abhishek Gour Reply Same issue on mine too. And it started pretty abruptly. Getting an air of around 2 hours now, which used to be 3- 3 1/2 hrs 10/15/2016 Mohammed Hussain Reply Hi friends this is Hussain Actually I’m using Nexus 5x 32gb last 2months, Mobile is fantastic performance but last time android nougat 7.0 upgrade in my device. Suddenly my play store apps download in WiFi network only not download in mobile data. Please rectify my issues. And battery also drain quickly compared to marshmallow… 10/18/2016 igybundy Reply Many of us got dead phones after the update, usually from 2015 models. So if it is out of warranty wait until google says something. It might have been a bad OTA during the release but some have posted from a couple of weeks ago when they decided to update. After the flash and reboot, the screen is blank and will not turn back on, for others it goes into a boot loop and can not be recovered except for a new motherboard. 11/16/2016 Brendon Reply This happened to mine. Phone bricked a fee weeks after upgrade never to come to life again. While on a call with Google I was transferred to LG who told me that they cover it under warranty for 18 months from date of manufacture. Mine is currently out for repair. 12/15/2016 Mac Reply This is happening A BUNCH!!!! Many 5x phones are turning into a paper weight… I was advised by my son, who is now using a back-up phone due to his 5x completely gone… AND is currently fighting with LG and Verizon because as soon as the update downloaded, it fried!!! 12/15/2016 Mac Reply Update to my last posting, LG and Verizon will reimburse for the loss of the phone (in my sons case) if the phone was purchased with a credit card. Apparently, if the phone was beyond its year of Warranty, the credit card purchase is a type of ‘Warranty’… But, this is what my son is telling me. He might have swallowed his pride on the loss, and simply upgraded a (14 month) old phone. I am finding it Pathetic that we are paying out $500 a year to be forced into a mandatory “upgrade” once a phone developer decides to render our working product USELESS. Maybe we should leave cars on the side of the road once the gas tank goes empty, and blame it on the dealerships!!!! 10/22/2016 Harshit Reply Have been experiencing lagging in my Nexus 5X after the update. The UI seems to get jammed. Also the camera loading takes a while 10/28/2016 Afshin Reply I have not received any OTA update for android 7 on my Nexus 5x! Is it normal? Another question! Does the android 7 causes Bootloop on Nexus 5x? 10/28/2016 Afshin Reply My Device runs Android 6.1! 11/14/2016 amir Reply @Afshin, I read about bootloop, but i just got my 5X today. I will open the box and post here about it. 11/16/2016 Sean Reply My battery life has been terrible with the first release of Nougat 7.0. I just updated to the latest update and the battery life boosted to double the amount. 75% showing 1 day and 5hrs of usage. 12/08/2016 Anonymous Reply So all the article here is doing is complaining about the 7.0 update but it doesn’t explain how to bypass it to update to 7.1? 12/15/2016 Steve Simms Reply Steve I just did the 7.1.1 upgrade on my Nexus 5x and it cycles through the start up look over and over. I have shut it down after trying the hard re-set numerous times. Does anyone have any ideas on a fix. Seeing I cant get the phone to open the home page before going through the start up mode again i’m not sure what to do next. HELP 01/06/2017 Scott Reply I still haven’t received the 7.1.1 OTA update for my 5X. I’m still on 7.0. Is this an issue with my phone or is Google still in the process of rolling it out? 01/08/2017 alanbecker.deviantart.com Reply Real instructive and wonderful anatomical structure of content , now that’s user friendly (: 01/11/2017 Matt Reply 7.1.1 has broken Bluetooth connectivity with many people with certain types of car head units. My Joying head unit repeatedly connects and disconnects now.

At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week, technology companies Panasonic, Qualcomm and Google have taken the concept of Android Auto one step further, presenting a standalone infotainment system running Android 7.0 Nougat software. The system also includes an LTE modem and the hardware necessary to make it operational in a vehicle. Automotive manufacturers would be able to purchase this system, then tailor its appearance and features as desired, similar to how various phone companies like Samsung and LG have different interfaces but still run the same version of Android. Thanks to the nature of Google’s software, the systems wouldn’t become outdated after a couple of years like in-house infotainment systems, with buyers able to install updates and add features over time. A demonstration of the system at CES will also show how the unit will be able to control Android-compatible apps along with in-vehicle systems like climate control. Autoblog reports the system also has the ability to process video and support multiple screens, which could allow each passenger an independent screen to stream media or browse the internet. This latest reveal follows Google’s unveiling of a Maserati Ghibli last May (Top and Below) that utilises Android software for its entire infotainment and in-car information systems – including a 15-inch central screen, digital instrument cluster and climate controls exclusively powered by Android. If these new in-car systems are a sign of what’s to come, we could soon see a battle of iOS versus Android in our cars and our smartphones in the not-too-distant future – that’s if Apple’s ‘Titan’ project ever makes it to market. Would you buy a car with an infotainment system running Android software?

Google has released this extension to the Mozilla Foundation under MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 in order that it might be used as part of Firefox if desired. We've landed this change on the trunk as a global extension as of 7 March 2006. You can read the discussion that lead up to to its integration in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=329292 Google started migrating their Safe Browsing to version 4 of the protocol in 2015. We are currently working on integrating V4 in our code base with a incremental approach. That is, we will be landing V4 patches progressively and leave the V2 stack up and running until the V4 is extensively tested and the Shavar server has been upgraded to V4. In other words, V2 and V4 will co-exist for a while to ensure we don't break Safe Browsing. See the V4 implementation plan for the milestones and bugs involved.

More like this Google Chromebook lacks luster -- and purpose In-depth: Google's Chrome OS and Samsung's Chromebook Microsoft Word vs. Google Docs: Which works better for business? Video Mingis on Tech: New year, new CES -- and new AirPods I must confess that I am a Chromebook evangelist and heavy user. For the majority of my everyday tasks, it works as well or better than my Windows laptop. It does most of the things a full-blown PC does for many typical users, and as companies including Microsoft and Google offer more and more cloud-based productivity suites, the relatively inexpensive Chromebook has become a valid choice for a second laptop. In some cases, it may even fill the role of a primary computer at a fraction of the cost. These affordable machines have gotten better and better over the past year or so. Keyboards have improved and there are a number of Chromebook models that have excellent displays, in marked contrast to many older models. Despite the many positive things that one could say about them, there is one issue that often causes headaches for Chromebook users: printing. Fortunately, there is a very simple way to print from a Chromebook. Unfortunately, it requires that you have a Google Cloud Print Ready printer. If you are purchasing a new printer, make sure that it is Cloud Ready and you will make things easier on yourself. You can find a list of Cloud Ready printers with setup instructions here. Once you have setup your Cloud Ready printer, you can use your Chromebook to make sure that you are properly connected: Open the Chrome browser.  In a new tab and type chrome://devices in the address bar.  Look under "My devices" and you should see your printer listed there.  After you have confirmed that your new printer is listed, all you need to do is either select "print" from the pull-down menu in the top right of your Chrome browser or use the Ctrl+P command.  But what if you still have a perfectly serviceable printer that isn’t Google Cloud Print Ready? I have a bulletproof Brother laser printer that should provide many more years of service, and I am unwilling to replace it just to make it easier to print from a Chromebook. If you are in the same boat, you can still print from your Chromebook -- it just takes a bit more effort. First, you will need to use either a Windows PC or Mac with the Chrome browser installed to set up Google Cloud Print and pair it with your Google account. Follow the steps below, and in a few minutes, you should be able to print from your Chromebook.   Turn on your printer. On your Windows or Mac computer, open Chrome. At the top right, click "More" and then "Settings." At the bottom, click "Show advanced settings." Under "Google Cloud Print," click "Manage." If prompted, sign in with your Google Account. Select the printers you want to connect, and then click Add printer(s).       Source: Google Chrome Help.  Once you have added your non-Cloud Ready printer to Google Cloud Print, you are ready to start printing from your Chromebook. There are a couple caveats, however. You will need to have your Windows PC or Mac powered up with the Chrome browser open. This is a minor inconvenience, but there is no way to avoid it. As long as everything is working properly you should now be able to print from any of your devices that have the Crome browser installed, including your Chromebook, using the same print commands described above that you would use with a Cloud Ready printer. In an ideal world, printing from a Chromebook would not require a second computer if you don't own a Cloud Ready printer -- but at least it is possible without buying a new printer or other hardware as long as you have a working Windows PC or Mac.

Kevin DrumJan. 6, 2017 2:04 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email A little while back I mentioned that Google Translate had gotten a lot better overnight when they switched to a new machine-learning algorithm. Their voice recognition got better too. And so did its question-answering capability. I was chatting about this at Christmas with my family, and we all decided we should test it. But not with anything boring. We know that Siri and Google and other digital assistants can find nearby coffee shops or tell us the weather in Berlin. How about something harder? The conversation then morphed into something about pencils, and my mother said she only trusted erasers that are pink. But why are they pink, we wondered? Why indeed? So there you have it? Not only did Google understand me, even with a cold, but it also understood the question and provided a brief and precisely on-point answer, which it read off very nicely. Impressive! Anyway, this strikes me as close to Watson-esque. The thing is, this is not as simple a question as it seems. It requires a fairly sophisticated understanding of context and meaning. And finding a source that matches the question perfectly is also pretty amazing. If my phone can do that, how long before it can drive a car too? Get the scoop,  straight from Mother Jones.

City played with verve and skill for 90 minutes, and fully deserved their margin of victory, but West Ham were dismal. They gave City time and space, and just failed to muster anything in attack. Maybe it would have been different if Feghouli hadn’t missed a sitter at 0-1, but West Ham were well beaten. This truly was a thrashing, and City become the first team to book a fourth-round place.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.39pm EST 16:39 87 min Agüero runs clear in the inside-right channel, but he shoots for goal instead of squaring it for Sterling, who is livid at not getting the pass. He would have had a tap-in. That was greedy from Agüero! Updated at 4.43pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.38pm EST 16:38 85 min Stones shrugged off Nordtveit and planted a firm header past Adrian from 12 yards.

Corner to City. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.35pm EST 16:35 81 min Is this City’s best away performance in the FA Cup since they, as a second-tier team, tonked then-Premier League Ipswich 4-1 in 2002? Berkovic and Bernabia ran the game that day, as I recall. And Shaun Goater with a couple of goals? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.32pm EST 16:32 78 min Another lovely nutmeg from Payet, but he can’t quite work the room for the shot. Antonio had a couple of efforts in the first half, but West Ham haven’t really tested Caballero in this second. They just haven’t played very well tonight.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.20pm EST 16:20 65 min A period of possession for Man City after that mild West Ham flurry. Here’s Tim Hall: “Having noted half-time’s three wise men on the BBC – Roasted Peanut, Frank and Wrighty, all dark suits looking like pallbearers, which on reflection, seems about right for West Ham just now.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.17pm EST 16:17 64 min Payet loops one high and long, but City clear, and now they can counter-attack. Sterling goes through the middle with pace and verve, but West Ham get bodies back and Nordtveit gets a decisive touch to deny a fifth goal. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.16pm EST 16:16 63 min Headed clear by Stones. But West Ham recycle it and Feghouli wins another corner. This is more like it! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.15pm EST 16:15 62 min Lovely nutmeg from Payet, who’s done more in two minutes that the rest of the Hammers have done all game, practically. Nordtveit crosses from the right, and Antonio almost gets on the end of it. Corner to West Ham, and this is better. Updated at 4.15pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.12pm EST 16:12 59 min Payet has effected an immediate improvement, and City are on the back foot for a moment. Here’s JR in Illinois: “Looks like the the extremely successful stadium move is continuing apace with an extended cup run. Also, probably because of all the winning, I never quite figured out what Karren Brady meant when she said that West Ham had “a real opportunity to change the brand values of the club”. Little help?” Anyone? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.10pm EST 16:10 57 min City make their first change, and Nolito replaces David Silva, who’s been top-class. His weight of pass and close control is just top-notch, isn’t it? One of my favourite players. And West Ham replace Carroll and Lanzini, who have done nothing, with Noble and Payet. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.09pm EST 16:09 56 min Sterling looks to have a shot at goal, but it won’t quite sit for him, and West Ham clear. But City win it back immediately. They’re under no pressure at all. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.07pm EST 16:07 53 min City could win this six or seven-nil if they wanted to. West Ham just haven’t played in this second half. It’s all extremely flat, and City, with about 35 minutes left, are just playing keep-ball. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.05pm EST 16:05 51 min West Ham just didn’t defend the corner. Sterling skinned Obiang, and teed up Touré. His shot was slightly mishit, but Agüero, sniffing a goal, reacted quickest and turned it past Adrian from about four yards. West Ham, I’m afraid to say, have been pathetic, and one or two fans are heading for the exits. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.03pm EST 16:03 GOAL! West Ham 0-4 Man City (Agüero 50) Oh dear. This tie really is over now. Sergio Aguero deftly diverts the shot from Yaya Touré into the back of the net. Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters Updated at 4.10pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.03pm EST 16:03 49 min Feghouli concedes a cheap corner, and West Ham have work to do defensively. Oh, that was nearly four! Stones won the header and Adrian had to be alert to stop Otamendi tapping in, and then in the second phase, Agüero clearly handballed before rifling a shot that Adrian had to turn over. Another corner. Updated at 4.13pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.59pm EST 15:59 47 min David Silva really rolled back the years in that first half – he was terrific. And Agüero produced two defence-splitting balls for goals No2 and No3. Excellent work from the pair of them. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.58pm EST 15:58 46 min We’re back. No changes from either side, but expect Payet to enter if things don’t change very soon. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.57pm EST 15:57 This tie isn’t over yet, but West Ham need to improve significantly. Man City were much the better team in the first half. The Hammers are in need some serious oomph. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.56pm EST 15:56 Jonathan Hill writes: “Much has been made of the Manchester Citeh “project” and the academy and facilities have been widely lauded. Yet, Pep decides to play Pablo Zabaleta in midfield instead of any homegrown youngster? Either the academy narrative is tosh (unlikely, given the honours the junior teams have won in recent years) or Pep has more in common with Mourinho than we thought.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.49pm EST 15:49 Drew Goldie has an opinion on that open goal miss/possible penalty shout: “Feghouli didn’t think it was a foul, which probably is an answer.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.44pm EST 15:44 Half-time: West Ham 0-3 Man City A smattering of boos from the home as the players exit. City have been clearly superior, but the first penalty award was soft, and there was some suggestion that Clichy fouled Feghouli and should have gone just afterwards. Whatever the rights and wrongs, City have one foot in the fourth round: they’ve been excellent. West Ham well below-par. See you shortly for the second half. Slaven Bilic has work to do at half-time. Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 4.05pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.42pm EST 15:42 45 min Two minutes of stoppage time. Chris Lewis asks: “Can you explain why penalties are never given against a defender who clatters a striker in the act of shooting? Clichy fouled Feghouli, and it was that foul which put Feghouli off and caused the miss. Penalty and sending off surely?” Ah, interesting. I’d have to see back on the replay. On first glance it looked as though Feghouli had just missed an open goal, but yeah, if the touch from Clichy was decisive, I guess he should have been dismissed. I need to see it again to be sure. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.40pm EST 15:40 44 min Another decisive attacking move from City. Sterling ran beyond the backline, and all of a sudden they had a three on one: Sterling crossed for Silva, who was all alone in the penalty box, and he waited and waited, dummied Adrian, and slotted home. Much too easy for Man City, and this is turning into a rout. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.38pm EST 15:38 GOAL! West Ham 0-3 Man City (David Silva 42) Brilliant again from the visitors, and it’s a sorry looking scoreline for West Ham. An unmarked David Silva slots in the third. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters Updated at 3.44pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.38pm EST 15:38 42 min Just a superb move from Man City. Silva had it on the halfway line, found Agüero, and he released Sagna down the right with a lovely delayed pass. Sagna ran past Ogbonna, and his cross was a peach. Nordtveit could only divert it past Adrian under pressure from Sterling. Super goal.

West Ham 0-2 Man City (Nordtveit og 41) That’s a magnificent goal, and City lead 2-0! Havard Nordtveit diverts the ball past Adrian under pressure from Raheem Sterling. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters Updated at 3.42pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.35pm EST 15:35 38 min Better from West Ham, and they win a corner, but City do well, and Caballero claims. Touré is a dead-eye from the penalty spot, by the way: OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) 13 - Yaya Toure has converted each of his 13 penalties for Manchester City in all competitions. Certainty.

While the Allo version of Assistant is capable of accepting typed input, the Pixel phone version has only been able to take commands through voice prompt. That appears to be changing, as the new Google app includes a button with a keyboard icon and a box to enter text. The text box includes the phrase “Type something…” just in case you weren’t sure what it’s for. The teardown also reveals that Google is prepping Google Assistant to work with Android Wear devices soon. We’ve known that Google plans on bringing Assistant to Android Wear since June of last year, but new evidence suggests it’s a priority. A few lines of code suggest Google has been working on the settings for Wear Assistant, with a feature that seems to let users select a different language for their watch compared to their phone. The teardown also revealed the existence of a new feature called Search gestures, which seems to be a new gesture you can perform to enable a search. Not a lot of details surrounding this, but it does seem as though you’ll be able to specify a certain type of search, either for searching through apps or the entire internet. local_offer    Google App   Google Assistant   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (5) stars Further Reading Pixel's Google Assistant gets screenshot button Old SHIELDs getting new features Google Assistant for TV New NVIDIA Shield TV Google Assistant adds Santa Tracker integrations stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertLatest OxygenOS update comes to the OnePlus 3T closeOnePlus pushes the latest OxygenOS Nougat update to the OnePlus 3 and 3T After users were discovered to be unable to download apps from the Play Store, OnePlus released a bug fix update for the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T. 2 more_vertGalaxy S8 to have IP68 rating closeSamsung Galaxy S8 is expected to feature IP68 water resistance The Samsung Galaxy S8 is rumored to have IP68 water resistance.

John Locher, AP Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email LAS VEGAS — Alexa, are you spying on me? It’s a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Play Video CBSN CES 2017 day one highlights From drones and robots to Amazon's Alexa, there were plenty of highlights from day one of CES 2017. President of Magid Advisors Mike Vorhaus join... Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. So what exactly is being collected, stored or shared? To work, the Echo is always listening. Once it hears someone utter a keyword, such as “Alexa,” it shares what it hears with Amazon’s servers to process a response. Those conversations are then stored indefinitely. Google’s Home speaker works in a similar fashion. The Echo “has to listen to everything. That’s kind of disturbing,” said Ryan O’Leary, vice president of WhiteHat Security’s threat research center. “It doesn’t capture voice until it hears the keyword, but it could. You’re trusting the devices to not do that, but it’s entirely possible.” In the Arkansas case, authorities investigating the death of a man found floating face-up in a hot tub at a friend’s home requested the contents of the home’s Echo and Amazon’s stored recordings in hopes they might contain evidence. The friend is charged with murder. A judge has signed off on the search, but Amazon has balked. Amazon has declined to comment specifically on the case but said the company objects to “overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.” Play Video CBS This Morning Can Amazon Echo data be used as evidence in murder case? Investigators in Arkansas have a search warrant to collect data from an Amazon Echo belonging to James Bates, charged with the murder of a man in... Some experts worry that allowing such a search would erode people’s privacy. “It’s not necessarily a direct threat for the average person, but the same thing can be said with any kind of privacy concern,” O’Leary said. “People say you shouldn’t be concerned if you’re not doing anything wrong, but that’s a dangerous precedent to set.” Meanwhile, companies keep asking consumers to invite them into their homes. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its smart-home appliances, including a washing machine, a stove and a refrigerator. Someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as the Echo. Simplehuman has a voice-activated trash can, and GE Lighting has a table lamp using Alexa voice control. For now, voice control is mainly an add-on feature rather than a core component of gadgets. It’s there for those who want to use it, but it’s not essential for the product to function. Play Video CBS This Morning From mixed reality to robotics, best of CES 2017 The much-anticipated Consumer Electronics Show opens today in Las Vegas. Over four days, tens of thousands of visitors will see the newest, flash... Many manufacturers are opting to use Amazon’s Alexa service for now, though some are embracing voice systems from Google, Apple or Samsung. Nvidia’s Shield TV streaming device, for instance, employs Google’s Assistant service so viewers can control video playback or find out the weather with just a voice command. Meanwhile, Samsung’s new Family Hub lets people use their voice to add items to shopping lists and order groceries online. CES chief economist Shawn DuBravac said as many as 700 companies could announce Alexa-integrated products during the gadget show, on top of more than 1,500 existing ones. As the smart home becomes more entrenched, DuBravac said, voice control could change the way we interact with technology in much the way the mouse did in the 1980s. “Connected microphones are starting to appear in everything from cars to children’s toys,” said James Plouffe, lead solutions architect at mobile-security company MobileIron. “Consumers should think carefully about how comfortable they are with the prospect of a live mic in common household items.” Because Amazon says it uses information gathered by the Echo to improve its voice technology, that information has the potential to “live forever” online, Plouffe said. 32 Photos Cool tech at CES 2017 Cutting edge technology on display at the year's biggest consumer tech show The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Derrick Dicol, executive director of Comcast’s Xfinity home, which uses voice controls in its home automation products, noted that people had to get used to sharing their banking information online. “This is less invasive than that,” he said. “It’s just a different thing people have to feel comfortable with.” Check out complete CES 2017 coverage from our partners at CNET. © 2017 The Associated Press.

Bentley Related Galleries Stunning Images Show the Earth's Imperiled Water While You Were Offline: Maybe Joseph Fiennes Playing Michael Jackson Wasn't the Best Idea What Better Way for the Marines to Prepare for Future Wars Than With Sci-Fi? 5 If you’ve been following the automotive world this week, you’ve heard a lot about self-driving, electric, and connected cars. You know, future-y stuff. That’s because most of the world’s automakers have crowded into Las Vegas to get their slice of the news cycle at CES. Bentley skipped the party and put out an announcement built around more conventional automotive terms: horsepower and speed. The upcoming Continental Supersports will be the most powerful Bentley ever, and at at a maximum of 209 mph—0 to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds—the fastest four-seat car on the planet. That sprint time is still shy of a Tesla Model S or a high-end Ferrari, but, the Supersport is a three-ton, luxurious, all-wheel-drive behemoth. Physics generally doesn’t like to move 6,000 pounds at Mach 0.27. Bentley bolted new turbocharges onto a reworked W12 engine to crank out the 750 pound-feet of torque and 700 horsepower that make that speed possible. Those stats put the Supersports (yes, that plural is on purpose) closer to the virile Dodge Challenger Hellcat than conventional competitors like the Rolls-Royce Wraith. To go with all the oomph, Bentley added a splitter and diffuser to the front and rear bumpers—carbon fiber, of course. If you want to knock 55 pounds off the total weight—or just have a cooler car—opt for the 21-inch wheels and titanium exhaust system. And of course, this being Bentley, you get to customize the interior. Probably some kind of endangered wood is available for paneling. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

It’s a Minivan Waymo Less than a week after exiting its larval, experimental phase and becoming a standalone company under the Alphabet corporate umbrella, Google’s self-driving car outfit is showing off its first new car. The newly created Waymo is adding 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans, built for autonomy, to its test fleet. Under a partnership established six months ago, engineers from Waymo and Fiat Chrysler collaborated in Michigan to build these hybrid-powered vans with the right tools for the job incorporated from the start, rather than retrofitting them after they came off the assembly line. Those include the computers that run its software algorithms and the suite of sensors—LIDAR, radars, and cameras—that adorn the roof and flank the sides of the car. Related Video Meet the Blind Man Who Convinced Google Its Self-Driving Car Is Finally Ready Unlike Waymo’s “pod” vehicles, which have room for two and skimp on basics like the steering wheel and pedals, these vans will have those controls, plus space for half a dozen passengers. Waymo also operates a fleet of about two dozen retrofitted Lexus SUVs. Neither company has said where their partnership will go from here, but it makes sense for Waymo to hook up with an established manufacturer. Waymo’s on a mission to bring its tech to market—whether through ridesharing, trucking, logistics, or personal vehicles—and working with a player who knows how to crank out cars will surely help that effort along. Despite reports saying these vehicles will start carrying customers by the end of 2017 (à la Uber’s recent efforts in Pittsburgh and San Francisco), Waymo and Fiat Chrysler say they’re just for testing. That doesn’t mean members of the public won’t climb aboard, however. In the past year, Waymo says, it has taken hundreds of Google employees and “guests” for rides in its autonomous vehicles, as it starts to figure out how the hoi polloi will interact with its technology—and how to bring it to market at long last.

It’s making an SUV that will likely combine gasoline and electricity, and might arrive this year. It’s working with MIT to figure out what the longterm future of the supercar entails. But the future hasn’t fully invaded Sant’Agata Bolognese just yet, as evinced by the newly revealed Lamborghini Aventador S. This latest iteration of the excellent Italian flagship supercar cuts through air like a deli slicer through Spam, reaching 62 mph in just 2.9 seconds and topping out at 217 mph. And it does it all with a naturally aspirated V12 engine: no turbochargers, no electric boost. Just the howl of exploding gasoline and the flapping of its driver’s ascot in the wind. The S’ sprint time and top speed match those of the “regular” Aventador; Lamborghini focused on making the car more drivable when the V12’s huffing. Together, the longer front splitter (or chin), vertical fins on the rear diffuser, and active rear wing increase downforce by 130 percent, crucial to keeping the rubber on the pavement at speed. Lamborghini has also added four-wheel steering (an old Honda trick lately adopted by the likes of Ferrari and Porsche), to improve control at three-digit speeds and reduce the turning radius for parking lot navigation. Inside the 3,500-pound wedge of carbon fiber, drivers enjoy a digital dashboard and Apple CarPlay, and of course whatever personalized options they pile on to the $421,350 base price. Lamborghini will start delivering the Aventador S to some very lucky/rich customers in Spring 2017. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Lamborghini Luxury cars supercars Skip Social.

Automotive designer Henrik Fisker has an ambitious plan to make electric vehicles cool. It starts with a jaw-dropping sedan for the rich and ends a few years later with an affordable sedan for the masses. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Fisker first sang this tune in 2008 when he launched Fisker Automotive. The company went bust in 2013 after selling a few hundred copies of the bug-ridden Karma sedan to the likes of Leonardo DeCaprio and Colin Powell. Well, Fisker is back with a new company, called, appropriately, Fisker Inc., and a plan that he swears is gonna work this time. (Hey, it’s working for Elon Musk.) Fisker the man has kept busy since Fisker the company tanked. He customized a Ford Mustang, giving it extra fierceness and outrage. He designed a motorcycle for the heir to the Lego fortune and a yacht for Italian shipmaker Benetti. And he teamed up with industry rabble-rouser Bob Lutz to stuff huge engines into lovely cars. Cool projects, but nothing that will change the world. Related Video Driving the Karma Revero, The Electric Car That’s Back From the Dead And so, Fisker—who has no role whatsoever with the born-again Karma Revero—is back with another electric vehicle that he pledges will rival Tesla for electric cool. Today, his startup released some slick renderings of the EMotion, a sporty luxury sedan with some pretty outlandish claims: 161 mph top speed and a range of 400 miles using top-secret graphene battery tech from UCLA-backed startup Nanotech Energy Inc. The EMotion, which looks like someone welded the Karma’s nose to Tesla’s Model 3, will boast “butterfly” doors. Why? Because fancy futuristic cars can’t have conventional doors, obvi. It will carry hardware to allow for fully autonomous driving. Made by who? “A soon-to-be-announced partnered supplier,” per the press release. And Fisker will follow this luxury car with an affordable version, so the unwashed masses can forget all about gasoline. When? Sometime after the EMotion debuts in mid-2017. It’s pure Fisker: great looks, big promises. Maybe this time he’ll deliver. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Electric Vehicles henrik fisker Luxury cars Tesla Motors Skip Social.

Perhaps that is to be expected, given that it is Lamborghini were talking about. The Italian automaker wants to join the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in pondering supercars for the third millennium. Lamborghini is hard at work on the technology and vehicles you’ll be lusting after in 2025, but wants to be even more forward-thinking than that. It remains to be seen just what Lamborghini expects from MIT, although anything that comes from the partnership probably would help Lamborghini’s siblings in the Volkswagen Group. Maurizio Reggiani, head of R&D at Lamborghini plans to spend the next few days talking to folks at the university to brainstorm ideas. “The super-sports car is always a laboratory for the future,”Reggiani says. While the “1000-year view” that Reggiani discusses sounds like nothing more than a line in a press release, it is fun to consider where things might go in the next decade or three. MIT excels at robotics, for example, so perhaps an autonomous supercar? Not likely says Reggiani. He believes Lamborghini owners always will insist on driving, but he can see semi-autonomous safety tech playing a role. He favors technology that helps drivers push their limits and sharpen their skills—a view Audi, which VW also owns, has expressed. “Autonomous has a different meaning for Lamborghini,” he says. Lamborghini is seen as a leader in the development and use of carbon fiber in road cars, and MIT’s work with advanced materials is another potential area of collaboration. The automaker has a lab (Lambo Lab!) in Seattle, where it works with Boeing on composite materials. Lamborghini could explore advanced bio-materials with MIT, that mimic the bones in birds, which are strong yet delicate, or perhaps even shape-shifting alloys. “I don’t know whether they’re third millennium,” says Serenella Sferza, co-director of the MIT Italy Program. “They might be fourth.” She’s kidding, of course, but Lamborghini must look to the future. Tightening fuel economy and emissions regulations have automakers embracing efficiency. MIT engineers could help Lamborghini move away from V8, V10, and V12 engines. In an announcement that is almost entirely coincidental, MIT just took another step toward practical, clean, nuclear energy.

Old-timey colors like “verde British” and “Rosso dino.” A carbon fiber front wing. Extra prancing horse badges. Tinted rear windows (in a two-seater). Chrome on the grille. A “handy fire extinguisher.” You can even buy the F12TDF, the limited edition, track-dedicated version of Ferrari’s flagship. Yet none of it slakes that yearning for what the ancient Romans would have called magis equi frementis. Today’s Italians know it as più cavallino rampante. In the American parlance, MORE FERRARI. Serious Supercars Aston Martin’s $3M Hypercar Takes F1 Performance to the Road Review: 2017 Porsche Panamera Ford’s Extra Special GT Supercar Is a Rolling Ode to American Dominance For that, you can have the F12 Caballería from Spanish boutique design shop Bengala Automotive. Of course, the first way to make MORE FERRARI out of a car that, at 731 horsepower offers no shortage of Ferrari, is to fashion every visible part of the car out of carbon fiber. The second way is to restyle the car, giving it sharper, more aggressive lines inspired by Ferrari’s GT3 race cars. Bengala’s designer made the air intakes bigger, and appears to have carved the front end with a machete. Where the F12berlinetta is elegant, the Caballería is aggressive. Just the thing for some Ferrari customers. “We bring to our customers an interpretation of their desires, based on their dreams,” says company CEO and founder Shoghi Saeidnia. “We mastered and created a unique piece of design and engineering.” That’s the fancy way of saying, “We added some Ferrari to your Ferrari for you.” No word on the price, but given that Bengala plans to build just 10, expect to pay MORE FERRARI money.

From January to October, some 200 people worked in three shifts on the Electrovan, the first electric vehicle powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. It had room for two, weighed 7,100 pounds, and could hit 60 mph in a not-quite-compelling 30 seconds. But it was the first of its kind, a new way of doing things. Hydrogen-powered cars can be refueled in just a few minutes, are just as capable as their gas-loving counterparts, and emit nothing but water as a byproduct. Today, GM heralded the Electrovan’s 50th birthday, noting it has since spent $2.5 billion developing fuel cell technology. Rad, right? Yup, until you realize that for all that time and money, the automaker has made effectively zero progress getting humanity to ditch fossil fuels for hydrogen. Plenty of folks are still pursuing this dream. Honda’s offering the Clarity Fuel Cell sedan in Japan. Toyota’s Mirai is available in the US, starting at nearly $60,000. Chevy just made a hydrogen-powered pickup for the US Army. But no one’s solved the fundamental problems with hydrogen power: There’s no real infrastructure to get the fuel around the country and into cars. And while hydrogen’s the most abundant element in the universe, making it into a useable fuel often involves natural gas—hardly a zero-emissions process. So yeah, GM marking 50 years of working on the stuff is like a a PhD celebrating his tenth year working on that thesis—and insisting he’ll be done real soon. Go Back to Top.

Tesla Motors announced today its new Model S P100D model will hit 60 mph in 2.5 seconds, thanks to a bigger, 100-kWh battery. That’s an upgrade over the P90D’s 2.8 seconds, and just one tenth of a second slower than what the million-dollar Ferrari LaFerrari can do. Except that this is a four-door sedan. The P100D version of the Model X SUV will hit 60 mph in 2.9 seconds. That’s the best stomach swirl for the money the auto industry has ever offered, and a terrific example of how much better electric cars are than internal combustion engines at delivering torque. The bigger battery will also offer 315 miles of range (up from just under 300) in the sedan, Tesla says—but not if you spend all your time enjoying that acceleration. Related Video How Tesla’s Self-Driving Autopilot Actually Works Of course, with great power comes great pricing. Well, great for Tesla, which is charging a base price of $134,500 for its fastest car ever. The P90D with “ludicrous mode” starts at $119,500. The Model X with the bigger pack starts at $135,500. If you’ve ordered a now measly-feeling P90D but haven’t gotten it yet, you can upgrade for $10,000. If you’re already driving one and now feel utterly lame, you can have the extra power installed, but it’ll cost you $20,000. In June, Tesla introduced the cheaper Model S 60, powered by a 75-kWh pack running software that limits its capacity by 20 percent. Customers who later decide they want more power can hand over $9,000, for which Tesla hits a button to update the car’s software and “unlock” the battery’s extra capability. It’s easy to imagine Tesla will do something similar with this bigger pack, for buyers who aren’t quite ready to spend the extra cash. Spend P90D money today, and once the 2.8 second sprint to 60 mph loses its edge, break out the credit card. Is a 0 to 60 mph time improvement of .3 seconds worth the extra cash? Tesla hopes so, because it says every dollar it can make off its luxury models will help fund its efforts to build the long-awaited, affordable Model 3, which should enter production late next year.

To add to the pile, Nissan now introduces the BladeGlider, a Zeus juice-powered razor blade on four wheels. Released in Rio de Janeiro this week, the prototype version of a concept Nissan first showed in 2013 is a 268-horsepower sports car with a heart of green, powered by a 220kW lithium-ion battery. The BladeGlider comes with rear-hinged dihedral doors (because conventional openings have no place in the future) and in two colors: “cyber green” and “stealth orange” (because … deer can’t see it?). The open top lets everyone know who’s releasing the fewest emissions in town, and the three-seat configuration borrowed from the famed McLaren F1 allows room for two passengers. Roll up to the club like the sustainable Liberace you are. You shouldn’t expect Nissan to actually put this thing on the market, but combined with the successful, all-electric Leaf and its leading efforts in the race towards autonomous driving, it’s clear the Japanese automaker’s girding up for the future.

It designed the car to stack up superlatives like a pre-schooler piles blocks: heedlessly. The Veyron was the fastest, most powerful, fanciest, and most completely unnecessary car on the planet for the entirely of its 10-year run. Bugatti made just 450 of them, sold them all for an average of $2.6 million apiece, and reportedly lost money doing it. You almost certainly won’t ever know the God-like power of driving a Veyron, let alone that of its even more gobsmacking successor, the Chiron. But TMB Art Metal will sell you a bit of Veyron, fashioned into a pair of cufflinks. The British firm makes these snazzy accessories from the front wheel of a Veyron damaged in a crash. (Don’t judge; 1,200 horsepower is difficult to control.) Just $385! The cufflinks won’t carry you to 200 mph in under 25 seconds, but given that they cost roughly 385,000 times more than a perfectly serviceable pair of plastic buttons, they’re every bit as impractical and excessive as the car that can.

He doesn’t call it that, of course. He gave it the far more benign name Master Plan, Part Deux. Beyond creating a vertically integrated company that builds electric vehicles, batteries to store the power to propel them, and the solar panels to generate that power, he wants to create whole new vehicle lineups. Some of them sound like they’re in advanced stages of development. The plan, which Musk posted to the Tesla Motors blog on Wednesday afternoon, comes a decade after Part One, which essentially laid out the company’s plan to make boatloads of money with the Model S so it could produce the more affordable Model 3. Having crossed those things off his to-do list—while also outfitting an automobile factory, a battery factory, and, oh, running SpaceX and Solar City—Musk has moved on to the second phase of his plan. Even as the company scrambles to produce the Model 3 sedan that Musk remains convinced will bring EVs to the masses, Tesla Motors, according to the Master Plan, Part Deux, sees itself creating a compact SUV and “a new kind of pickup truck.” Beyond that, Musk says, “there are two other types of electric vehicle needed: heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport.” Related Video Tesla’s Summon Feature Is Like Knight Rider. Kinda He means big-rigs and buses, and says both are the early stages of development—and could be revealed next year. “We believe the Tesla Semi will deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport, while increasing safety and making it really fun to operate.” Now, electric buses are nothing new. San Francisco is crawling with them. But a Tesla bus? You know it would be gorgeous. Musk says they’d be smaller than you’re used to, but offer plenty of room for wheelchairs, strollers, and bikes. They’ll be quick enough to keep up with traffic, and deliver a smooooth ride. Where things get really wild, though, is his claim that Tesla buses would not have to stick to pre-determined routes like the busses that rumble past your office. A little intelligent planning with smartphones and mapping (think = Uber Pool) can deliver people right to their door. He’s even put some thought into what people without smartphones will do. They can use fixed summon buttons at existing bus stops, which will otherwise be redundant. Looking a little further into the future, Tesla will continue developing its autonomous technology so all of these cars and trucks and buses do the driving. And then come the autonomous ride-sharing services in which Telsa owners let strangers borrow their cars or Tesla operates urban fleets “ensuring you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you are.” Individually, none of these ideas is at all radical. You’d be hard-pressed to find an automaker that isn’t following Google in the race to autonomous cars, Daimler recently unveiled an autonomous big-rig, and a Tesla co-founder has developed a pretty sweet electric garbage truck. What is staggering here is the scale. Musk wants to do it all, immediately, and tie it all together in a cohesive system. It’s so crazy it’s brilliant. And if Musk’s record so far is any indication, don’t bet against him pulling it off.

So “Ole Yeller” feels like a weird moniker for Ford’s latest special edition Mustang, until you realize it’s not named for that most loyal of hounds, at least not directly. The name actually comes from the famed P-51D Mustang fighter plane still flown by stunt pilot Bob Hoover. And it actually makes sense once you know Ford plans to auction off the ride and give the proceeds to charity. Anyway, on to the car. This Ole Yeller is actually a Shelby GT350 Mustang, powered by a 5.2-liter V8 engine that barks out 526 horsepower and 429 pound-paws of torque. Because there’s some measure of justice in this world, the driver controls all that power with a six-speed manual transmission. To make this GT350 extra special, Ford threw in “Ole Yeller” accents and badging, Recaro racing seats, and gauges inspired by plane cockpits. Of course, there’s extra carbon fiber, and the mirrors apparently project images of the P-51. Just don’t park it near any rabid wolves.

Mercedes-Benz wants to do the same for the lowly golf cart. The Germans believe golfers need a more “premium” mode of getting around the links. If you can suspend your skepticism, the Mercedes-Benz Style Edition Garia Golf Car makes a compelling case. It has fancy wheels and a carbon fiber roof and Mercedes describes it as “sporty and well-balanced,” which seems like a stretch. The rear spoiler doubles as a golf bag holder. Of course. Inside, a 10.1-inch touchscreen keeps tabs on your range, (up to 50 miles), lets you select sport (!) and eco modes, and displays a course map and scorecard. A mini fridge under the leather seat keeps your beers cold, and cupholders keep them from toppling when you get up on it. What you don’t get is a 3-pointed star. This ride wears the logo of Garia, the golf cart manufacturer that Mercedes worked with. There’s no word on price yet, but this is a case where asking that question means you can’t afford one.

But if that’s your style and you’ve got the stockpiles of gold to fund it, you may as well combine the two extremes and pick up the LaFerrari convertible, the latest spin on Maranello’s supercar della giornata. The “base” version of the LaFerrari, which entered production in 2013 and costs more than a million dollars, carries an 8.0-liter V12 engine and a 120-kW electric motor that together propel the pile of carbon fiber, leather, and human-shaped money piles to 62 mph in under three seconds, and up to 217 mph. Ferrari apparently put so much brainpower into its most powerful car ever, it didn’t have any left over to think of a real name for the thing. Same goes for the new edition, which Ferrari just calls “the open-top version of the LaFerrari,” a machine for those “who refuse to compromise on the joy of al fresco driving even when at the wheel of a supercar.” The Italians won’t reveal any specs on the new hybrid ride until the Paris Motor Show in October, but say they’ve modified the chassis to be just as rigid as the original coupe, with a tweaked design to make up for the havoc an open top wreaks on the aerodynamics. You can bet your offshore bank account that without a roof in the way, the price will go up, too. Still, it’s one exciting way to get the wind in your hair.

Now, it’s not like the Ford GT needed any improvement. It just walloped Ferrari, Aston Martin, Corvette, and Porsche to win its class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. But in the supercar realm, there’s always someone who wants more. Ford delivers it with the Ford GT ’66 Heritage Edition, a black and silver homage to the GT40 that swept the Le Mans podium half a century ago. The “standard” 2017 GT runs $400,000 or so, and squeezes more than 600 horsepower from a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine. The special edition boasts the same specs but gets comfier seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and blue webbing on the seat belts to match those of the the ’66 car. For bonus points, Ford is making each 20-inch wheel from a single piece of forged aluminum, which is painted gold. And it’s exposing more of the car’s carbon fiber. Because carbon fiber is cool. No word on what the car costs or who’ll get to drive it home. Rest assured it will require a very big check—and a very good application. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Beyond offering some protection from market upheaval, having a crazy amount of money lets you ask Aston Martin to spend nine months building a one-of-a-kind roadster. The British automaker started with a GT12 Coupe but voted to ditch the roof so the chap could hear the V12 roar. They also swaddled the car in carbon fiber and bolted on a titanium exhaust, because of course they would. A GT12 hits 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and runs $340,000. The convertible is probably a bit slower and one hell of a lot more expensive, even with a cratered pound.  Aston Martin head honcho Andy Palmer says this car “demonstrates the expanded capabilities of Q,” the automaker’s bespoke department.

Maserati Related Galleries Stunning Images Show the Earth's Imperiled Water While You Were Offline: Maybe Joseph Fiennes Playing Michael Jackson Wasn't the Best Idea What Better Way for the Marines to Prepare for Future Wars Than With Sci-Fi? 5 Maserati finally got around to updating the Quattroporte, its flagship sedan. At a glance, you’ll see more chrome on the grille and matte black on just about everything else. It’s nice, but the interesting changes are the new infotainment system and the suite of active safety features. I drove the 2015 Quattroporte S Q4 from Manhattan to its spiritual summer home, the Jersey Shore. The performance impressed me—the sedan hits 60 mph in less than five seconds, thanks to all-wheel drive and a 3.0-liter V6 that thankfully doesn’t keep its voice down. But the Maserati fell short when the road straightened and traffic piled up. I found the infotainment system infuriating, and the navi system’s maps illegible and often incorrect. Worse, the car lacked safety features like blind spot monitoring, and lane departure warning offered on cars one-third its price. This isn’t a problem in sports cars like the Alfa Romeo 4C, the Quattroporte’s corporate comrade, because you expect them to be something of a pain in the ass to live with. But the Quattroporte is a flagship sedan competing with the likes of the Audi A8, Mercedes S-Class, and BMW 7 Series—all of which offer superior amenities. The Maserati starts at $106,900. Buyers may want Italian performance and styling, but they’re also going to want the best of modern automotive technology. So it’s a smart play adding adaptive cruise control, lane departure and forward collision warnings, automatic braking, and a surround view camera, all of which make driving the Quattroporte easier and safer. The infotainment system is built around an 8.4-inch touchscreen, runs Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and ought to be easier to use. Maybe for next year, Maserati can add a gesture control system to suit its Italian heritage. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Luxury cars Maserati Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Christie Hemm Klok/WIRED Tesla’s Model S just got more affordable. Elon Musk’s electric car company announced this morning it will introduce a version of the sedan with a less powerful 60-kilowatt-hour battery pack, at a base price of $66,000. That makes it a bit cheaper than the previous cheapest version of the car, which started at $70,000. The Model S is still very much a luxury car, and that new lower price is still double what Americans pay on average for a new vehicle. But it’s striking because it’s the first time Tesla has made one of its products cheaper. Since its 2012 introduction, Tesla has steadily improved the sleek seven-seater—and the price has gone up accordingly. It was introduced for under $60,000, but the base price had risen up to $70,000. (The top of the line model, the P90D, with all-wheel drive and a 90-kWh battery pack, starts at $109,500.) The sedan now comes with all-wheel drive (a $5,000 option on the new 60-kWh version), autopilot, and a slew of software improvements that make driving on electricity more practical. Related Video Meet the Model 3, Tesla’s Most Important Car The new Model S 60 will offer a range of more than 200 miles (you get close to 300 in the 90D), a 0 to 60 mph time of 5.5 seconds, and standard active safety features. You get the hardware (cameras and radar) necessary for autopilot, but the software that actually lets you take your hands off the wheel will cost you another $2,500. Interestingly, the battery pack in this new car is in reality a more powerful 75-kWh pack, handicapped to perform as if it were a 60-kWh unit. For $9,500, you can unlock the car at any point with an over-the-air software update, and snag a 19 percent range bump. Though it’s possible there are other practical benefits to offering this battery, Tesla says the price drop is a response to potential customers “who would like to buy a Model S, but can more easily afford it only at a lower price point.” Whatever the reasoning, there’s symbolism here. For the past decade, Musk has been promising an electric car for the hoi polloi, to do in this century what Ford’s Model T did in the last. That car will be the Model 3, the $30,000 car Tesla showed off in March, but won’t start building until late 2017, at the earliest. This Model S is no working man’s car, but it’s a step closer to the masses. Related Video Gear Tesla’s Summon Feature Is Like Knight Rider.

More than 500 horsepower, whether from internal combustion, electric motors, or both. Doors that open up (like this), not out (like this). And carbon fiber. Gobs of it. The McLaren 675LT has all of that, which makes creating yet another variation on the theme tough. After all, how do you top dihedral doors and a V8 that sounds like heaven as it produces a demonic 666 horsepower? You make the entire thing out of carbon fiber and call it the “McLaren Special Operations Carbon Series LT.” It’s not like the 675LT Spider, the foundation upon which Mac based this insanity, wanted for carbon. The bumpers, underbody, side skirts, intakes, airbrake, rear fenders, and rear deck are made of the stuff. You might wonder, what’s left? Well, the retractable roof, the A-pillars (the vertical supports between the windshield and doors), the trunk, and the wings. Oh, and the gas tank cap. The Spider weighs just 3,016 pounds, the extra carbon makes the special version even lighter. Necessary? God no. Desirable? Hell yes. McLaren is making just 25 copies, and has already sold each for a bit more than half a million apiece. McLaren plans to start deliveries later this year. That certainly means a few trips up some very long driveways, but the car’s 0 to 62 mph time of 2.9 seconds and 203 mph top speed should get all that gloss-covered carbon fiber to the doorstep right quick.

The Consumer Electronics Show (now officially simply termed CES) turned 50 this year. And yet, rather than turn stale or start to fade into irrelevance, the 2017 show brought some genuine innovation we haven't seen in quite a while. Sure, wacky gadgets and pointless prototypes are all over the place at CES, but this might be the year that many of them actually become reality. For instance, we didn't see many gimmicky curved televisions on the show floor. Instead, LG really wowed us with a new, incredibly thin OLED TV that houses all of its processing power in a sleek connected soundbar. Faraday Future showed off an electric self-driving supercar that can park itself, and should actually make it to market next year. The PowerRay drone from PowerVision doesn't work in the air, like you might expect, but underwater, to help you catch fish. And Razer's Project Valerie, while just a concept, proves that when it comes to gaming laptops, three screens are better than one. Other top products are more about refinement than revolution. Lenovo's Smart Assistant speaker, its take on the Amazon Echo, looks and sounds better than the device it emulates. The Asus Zenfone AR smartphone brings augmented reality (in the form of Google Tango) to a reasonable form factor. And the Misfit Vapor looks and acts a lot like the Apple Watch for nearly half the price. Check Out the Best Photos From CES 2017! It certainly wasn't easy when you take into account the sheer number of devices (and opinions) that funneled into this story, but we've tried our best to highlight the very best of what we've seen over the past week in Las Vegas. We've had some good luck picking in the past, as many devices turned out to earn top marks in testing. (On the other hand, some of them also vanished without a trace.) Ultimately, we're hoping to see all of these gadgets hit the market at some point in the future. But even if it's just some of them, the future looks bright.—Alex Colon Best Laptop Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe Reports of their death have been greatly exaggerated: Laptops were everywhere at CES this year, in all shapes and sizes. As far as general notebooks go, the Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe is the one that really caught my eye. This ultra-slim laptop is only 0.5-inch thick, weighs 2.42 pounds, and just looks, well, gorgeous. The aluminum-and-glass body comes in royal blue with gray and gold accents, or in all silver and really makes a statement. A generous (and sharp) 14-inch display in the body of a 13-inch laptop, a speedy Core i7 processor, and up to 1TB of solid-state storage make this ultraportable a winner. —Matthew Buzzi Best Gaming Laptop Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series The Inspiron 15 7559 was one of our favorite laptops in recent years for its unmatched value, and Dell looks to have done it again. Starting at $799, the new Inspiron 15 can be equipped with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 or 1050 Ti, an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, a full HD or 4K UHD screen, and up to 32GB of memory. Storage can be configured up to 512GB M.2 SSD and/or a 1TB hard drive, and all of this fits into a one-inch-thick, chassis that's even nicer looking than before. The Inspiron 15 7000 Series may not be the most powerful gaming system, but it's versatile and fast, with a very attractive price point. —MB Best Convertible Hybrid Laptop HP EliteBook x360 The HP EliteBook x360 is a business laptop with style. Taking plenty of inspiration from the HP Spectre x360, the new convertible model is slim and light, but durable and secure. It's just 0.59 inches thick, but packs plenty of speed and can be configured with up to a 4K touch display. One of its killer features is the optional HP Sure View, a built-in privacy screen that can be toggled on and off with the press of a button. It works like a charm, thwarting prying eyes without the need for one of those unsightly films. —MB Best Phone Asus Zenfone AR Augmented reality is in its very early days, but it's easy to guess that it's going to be even bigger than VR. The Asus Zenfone AR is the first manageably sized smartphone to be able to run both Google's Daydream VR and Tango AR systems. Unlike the gigantic Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, the first Tango device, the Zenfone AR actually feels like a phone you'd want to use, even if you never augment your reality. It has a sharp camera, a high-res screen, a fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, and a nicely textured back. Asus doesn't tend to sell a lot of phones in the US, but this one shows us where Google wants to push all of our forms of reality. —Sascha Segan Best Smartwatch Mistfit Vapor Amidst a sea of forgettable smartwatches at the show, the Misfit Vapor truly stands out. From its comprehensive fitness tracking to its understated elegance, the Vapor is an excellent blend of form and function. Its AMOLED display is bright and colors are vibrant, and its circular touch bezel means you don't have to worry about constantly wiping greasy fingerprints off the screen. And at $199, it's also kinder to your wallet than the Apple Watch Series 2. —Victoria Song Best Camera Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH5 CES was very light on pro camera gear this year, which makes the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH5 an easy pick for best in show. But even if there had been more competition, Panasonic's latest upgrade of its professional video/still hybrid Micro Four Thirds camera would be a serious contender. It's got everything a professional cinematographer could want, including 4K capture at up to 60fps, in-body image stabilization, programmable focus racks, and support for 10-bit capture. Likewise, still photographers will enjoy its quick autofocus system, quick burst rate, and rugged build. —Jim Fisher Best Drone PowerVision PowerRay Leave it to PowerVision, the company so far best known in the US for making an egg-shaped quadcopter, to remind us that a drone doesn't need to have four rotors and fly through the air. Its PowerRay, a remote-controlled submersible with a built-in 4K video camera and a fish finder, not only allows you to capture high-resolution video of the life aquatic, but it works to improve your chances of reeling in a nice big catch. It's new, different, and a little bit crazy—but if it works, it could end up being more of a friend to fishermen than cough drops ever were. —JF Best Car Faraday Future FF91 Faraday Future has only been around for two years, and has made our best of CES list for both of them. Last year it showed a non-functional dream car, the FFZERO1, but this year the company has a prototype that actually works. The FF91 is a self-driving automobile that runs on a 130kWh battery to deliver up to 378 miles between charges. Throw in a zero-to-60 time of just 2.39 seconds, and you have one of the most innovative automobiles ever assembled. We say assembled, but it isn't exactly clear if Faraday Future will actually make these vehicles. (The company had to stop production on its factory late last year because of cash flow problems.) Faraday Future is taking pre-orders for the FF91 now, along with a $5,000 deposit. The earliest the FF91 will ship is 2018 and there's final price yet. And then there is the fact we have no idea if its actually smart enough to safely navigate public roads. Any way you look at it, the Faraday Future FF91 is a long shot. Then again, we said the same thing about Tesla. —Dan Costa Best Television LG Signature W OLED Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology can produce excellent pictures on incredibly thin panels. LG is pushing the limits of what OLED can do with the Signature W series. This TV does away with the bezel and the body of the screen, leaving you with only a 0.1-inch-thick rectangle you can hang on your wall like a poster. All of the processing and connections are offloaded to a soundbar connected with a single ribbon cable, and that soundbar adds Dolby Atmos audio compatibility to the TV's Dolby Vision and HDR-10 video capabilities. Expect a pretty hefty price tag for such a slim TV. Still, wow. —Will Greenwald Best Home Theater Gear Dish AirTV As a media streamer, Dish's AirTV is a simple Android TV box that focuses on Sling TV. It wouldn't be particularly impressive next to any Amazon Fire TV or Roku device. However, an OTA TV tuner and a focus on accessibility could make the AirTV a boon for less tech-savvy cord-cutters. This $129.99 bundle jumps straight into Sling TV, letting you access both live TV over the subscription service and OTA television with an antenna, along with your Netflix queue on the same screen. —WG Best Audio Product Lenovo Smart Assistant The Lenovo Smart Assistant is a lot like Amazon's Echo, only better. It looks better, sounds better, and costs less. Just like the Echo, the Smart Assistant uses Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, which will answer your questions, make grocery lists, and, of course, order stuff from Amazon. The $129.99 speaker comes equipped with a 5-watt tweeter and a 10-watt woofer. An upgraded Harman Kardon Edition includes an extra 2-inch sound cavity for enhanced sound quality (no pricing has been announced). We're looking forward to a head-to-head comparison with the Echo when it comes out in May. —AC Best Gaming Gear Innex Super Retro Boy If you couldn't tell from the NES Classic Edition, the hottest game systems of the holiday season, retro gaming is bigger than ever. Innex is one of a handful of companies that focuses on helping you play your classic games. The company showed off several new ways to play old favorites, but the standout is the Super Retro Boy. This Game Boy-shaped device can play Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance cartridges, with a backlit color screen and 10-hour battery life. There's a reason the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance dominated handheld gaming for two decades, and this little time machine will remind you why.—WG Best AR/VR Headset Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 VR Headset Unlike most VR headsets, which require a connected phone or computer, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 VR headset is a completely standalone product. Similar to the HTC Vive, the Qualcomm headset can actually sense when you're moving, which means you can walk around and the virtual world you see will respond accordingly (though the HTC Vive accomplishes this with sensors you place around your room). It's only a reference device right now, but it's a cool concept we hope to see adopted in some consumer-ready products this year. —AC Best Smart Home Device Sleep Number 360 Smart Bed Sleep Number pioneered the idea of a mattress with two unique settings, but those settings have always required user input. With the Sleep Number 360, the company has released a bed that will adapt to your body in real time. You can still manually set your ideal "number," but the 360 will also respond to your nocturnal rocks and rolls, adjusting mattress firmness automatically. The bed also includes a foot warmer that turns on automatically at your usual bed time. And if you are one of those people with a partner who snores, the bed will automatically lift their head to improve air flow and dampen the noise. Of course, all of this can be controlled via an app, and the mattress also supports Nest and IFTTT integrations. —DC Best Smart Appliance LG Smart InstaView Refrigerator If you're in the market for a high-end fridge with all the bells and whistles, this is it. The LG Smart InstaView features a 29-inch touch screen on its upper right door on which you can browse recipes and leave notes for family members. There are cameras that take photos of your food, and connect with an app so you can see what's inside wherever you are. The coolest part, and what sets it apart from Samsung's Family Hub refrigerator, is that it uses Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, so you can ask it to play music, report the news or weather, and a perform a host of other nifty tricks. —Angela Moscaritolo Best Fitness Wearable Motiv Ring Who says a fitness tracker has to be worn on your wrist? While smart rings aren't exactly new, the Motiv Ring stands out for a number of reasons. For starters, it measures the same metrics that larger, wrist-based fitness trackers do: steps, heart rate, calories burned, sleep, distance traveled, and activity types. It's also waterproof up to 160 feet, so you can wear it in the pool or while washing dishes. Plus, its clever charging port means you don't have to lug around yet another cable. If the Motiv Ring proves to be as accurate as the best wrist-based models, it could bring fitness tracking to a whole new level—your finger. —VS Best Desktop HP Sprout Pro The original Sprout had some issues, but HP's new Sprout Pro is undoubtedly the coolest desktop at CES this year. It projects a 21.3-inch full HD digital mat down onto the desk, similar to its predecessor. The kicker, though, is that the new Sprout can now perform 2D and 3D scanning, by taking a real object and turning it into a 3D model in seconds after you rotate it in view of the cameras. You can enhance the digital version further by snapping some HD pictures of each side, making the digital textures much higher-resolution than the scan. It's a fast, easy process, and the implications across multiple fields like education and medicine could be tremendous. It also functions as a standard desktop, and the camera is relatively innocuous considering its capabilities. —MB Best Display Dell Canvas Dell's Canvas is a horizontal Surface Studio-like device with a few key differences. It has no PC hardware of its own, which greatly reduces the cost (around $1,799). Instead, it connects to an existing PC and monitor, serving as a second input-focused screen. The 27-inch display is a cool, natural evolution of an artist's analog workspace, complete with a tool called the Totem that allows for physical control of the digital UI by placing it on the screen. With QHD resolution, it looks sharp, but isn't as demanding as 4K, which makes it better suited to working with a wider array of systems. —MB Best Networking Product Linksys Velop It seems as though the standard Wi-Fi router might be going the way of the dodo in 2017. Actually, probably not, but in wireless networking, Mesh-based Wi-Fi systems, which promise to blanket your home with seamless coverage that extends to every last corner, are all the rage right now. Products like Eero, Google Wifi, Luma, and many others fit the same profile: Slick design, easy app-enabled setup and use, minimal configuration options. And the Linksys Velop follows suit. It's rare that we get to test a product that debuts at CES before the show, but we've been using Velop for a few weeks and it's the best Wi-Fi system we've tested. Networking vet Linksys is late to the game here, but brings a top-notch app with well designed, future-proof hardware that delivers the fastest single stream and MU-MIMO throughput speeds we've seen. In fact, it's our Editors' Choice. —Wendy Sheehan Donnell Best Toy Lego Boost Lego Mindstorms is one of our favorite robotics kits, but it's pretty complicated and expensive. Lego Boost is Mindstorms' friendlier, more affordable little brother. The kit is just over half the price of Mindstorms, and its Move Hub brick lets you program it with a mobile device to do almost anything. Thanks to sensors, motors, and basing all of the processing around your tablet instead of the Move Hub itself, you can build a car, a cat, a guitar, or even a Lego-building 3D printer. All of these projects are just the first steps to making your own creations with Boost and its simple, flexible programming interface. —WG Best Robot Kuri Kuri from Mayfield Robotics has personality in spades. From its intergalactic space penguin aesthetic, to its adorable chirps, bleeps, and bloops, Kuri is one of the first personal assistant robots to evoke the same emotional response as beloved fictional characters like BB-8 and Wall-E. But cuteness isn't all it has going for it. Kuri is able to navigate past obstacles, read bedtime stories, play your favorite tunes or podcasts, patrol your home, and tell your naughty pup to get down from the couch. If you're willing to plunk down $700, it'll probably take no time to develop an emotional attachment—and that's real progress toward making the Singularity a lot less scary. —VS Best New Technology Aira There are more than 20 million visually impaired people in the United States, and by and large they get around just fine. There are times, however, when a second pair of eyes could be useful. That is what Aira delivers. By using either Google Glass or Vuzix glasses and a Wi-Fi hotspot, Aira allows the blind to show an agent what they are seeing. Agents get a live video picture along with Google map data. This can help a visually impaired person navigate a crowded intersection, or just choose between brands at the grocery store. Agents are on call 12 hours a day, and charges start at under 40 cents per minute. Aira is basically vision-as-a-service, and perhaps even more remarkable, a Google Glass application people will actually use. —DC Best Concept/Prototype Razer Project Valerie While this three-screen, 12K laptop may not ever end up as a consumer product, it's still one of the most talked-about and ambitious concepts in Vegas this year. Two 4K displays spread out like wings from the main screen, and fold into the extra room behind the primary display when not in use. Project Valerie is only about as thick as two Razer Blade Pros stacked together, and somehow, it was able to run a game at full resolution across the three screens, which is a pretty amazing feat. (Granted, specs are under wraps, and it did get quite warm while playing.) Still, it looks completely outrageous, and may stay the stuff of dreams forever, but isn't dreaming big what CES is all about? —MB Back to top Previous : What to Expect at CES 2017 Get a Samsung 55-Inch 4K HDTV for $750 Next : By PCMag Staff Check out our masthead to see who we are, and what we do.

The Nexus 6’s Android 7.1.1 update is now available. It should be rolling out over the air, but if you’ve got an N6 and don’t feel like waiting any longer for your helping of Android 7.1.1, you can grab the factory image or OTA image directly from Google and sideload them now if that's something you're comfortable doing. The build number for the update is N6F26Q. Google first released Android 7.1.1 to Pixel and Nexus phones in early December, but the Nexus 6 had to wait for its helping of 7.1.1 because Google discovered a “last minute bug” with that update. The issue was taken care of by the end of December, though, and now Nexus 6 owners can kick off 2017 with the latest version of Nougat. Android 7.1.1 contains some notable new features, like the ability to long press on an app icon to get shortcuts for jumping to certain parts of that app. So if you’ve got a Nexus 6, be on the lookout for your Android 7.1.1 update so that you can install it and get those new features as soon as possible.

This could become reality because the pop megastar took on a role usually assumed by investigative journalists: She decided to “follow the money.” So when she discovered Apple was prepared to give away her songs for free (no royalties) in a promotion for its streaming service, Swift told Apple, “I don’t ask for free iPhones, so why free music?” Apple backed down after Swift wrote an open letter to its CEO Tim Cook, and not only paid for her music offering during the promotion period, but the tunes of every other artist. Related The Bart & Fleming Podcast Episode #9: New Year, New Beginning Swift’s rebellion may pay dividends long term by pointing up this broader question: Why is it that, while vastly more creative content is being consumed worldwide, less revenue is flowing to the people who create it? This is the issue probed by Jonathan Taplin in an important new book that demonstrates how intellectual property has been hijacked by what he calls the new “marketing monoculture” led by Facebook, Amazon and Google. Taplin even puts a number on it: He estimates that some $50 billion a year has been quietly shifting from content creators to “owners of the monopoly platforms.” Little, Brown Taplin’s book, from Little, Brown, is titled Move Fast And Break Things: How Google, Facebook And Amazon Cornered Culture And Undermined Democracy. Its message seems timelier following the recent techno love-fest between the web giants and President-elect Donald Trump. Taplin’s own career has spanned the creative spectrum, starting as a roadie for Bob Dylan; he then moved into film production, then academia where he directed the Annenberg Innovation Laboratory at USC. I have known Taplin for years and have found him to be a smart and thoughtful student of the cultural landscape. Having examined it from different perspectives he became infuriated by its anomalies. Why, he asks, have creative people, and the companies who control content, tolerated a level of piracy that has impoverished everyone except the kleptocrats who distribute content? One reason: We’ve all been distracted by the wrong issues. Objections have been raised to the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&T, for example; yet the combined $300 billion market cap of these companies is about half that of Alphabet, the parent of Google. According to Taplin, every pirated music video or song on YouTube or Facebook “robs the creators of income,” given that YouTube is dominated by unlicensed content. YouTube presides over a 55% market share of streaming audio. To be sure, this phenomenon is especially rampant in the news business where revenues from advertising have been all but obliterated as Facebook (among others) has sucked up a giant share of digital advertising revenue. But the dangers, Taplin argues, go beyond the flow of money to the flow of news, real or fake. “We have ceded much of our freedom to choose by giving networks like Google and Facebook control of our (news) menu,” Taplin points out AP Few of us “outsiders” understand exactly how the news menu is determined by the black box algorithms, which significantly shape the course of our digital lives and beliefs. According to Jim Rutenberg, writing in the New York Times, the election of Trump might potentially present an opportunity for news organizations to challenge this. “Buying a subscription is tantamount to supporting the pillars of democracy” — that’s the new post-election sales pitch from magazines ranging from Vanity Fair to the New Yorker to The Atlantic, he reports. The home page banner of Vanity Fair heralds that it is “the magazine Donald Trump doesn’t want you to read.” Conde Nast claims a record 42,000 new signups by last Sunday. What can creatives do about these phenomena? Taplin for one is launching a series of Artist Rights Forums, visiting creative communities nationwide which he feels are “in denial.” He firmly believes artists can be mobilized to support legislation and other initiatives to restore a degree of equity in the distribution of artistic income. In short, more people should follow the money, like Taylor Swift did. “Taylor Swift won her battle with Apple last year,” Taplin said, “but only a very few artists have the muscle to set the terms of their deal.” Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 12 12 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Millennial filmmaker • on Jan 6, 2017 9:28 am The older generation has ignored the cries for help from young artists. We don’t get VHS or DVD residuals or royalties. We don’t get to control the distribution of our products. The unions stay silent and the old media is too busy selling themselves off to China. Depressing how the older generation eats it’s children. Reply Anonymous • on Jan 6, 2017 11:18 am Fair enough, but at the same time, maybe you need to stand up for yourself and not give it away for free-create your own distribution and platforms, say no to big content… Reply Millennial filmmaker • on Jan 7, 2017 10:12 pm What do you expect us to do, put our work on VHS? Reply Film people • on Jan 6, 2017 9:35 am In addition to music, YouTube is filled with pirated movies and TV shows. They could stop them if they wanted, but they don’t, because their business is clicks. It’s really disgusting and hypocritical. Reply Nerdrage • on Jan 6, 2017 9:39 am Exactly what I have been saying for a while. Content is not king, distribution is, or will be. Content production is exploding while distribution is telescoping because customers want breadth of access, not multiple subscriptions. They go right for the biggest option. More and more content will be competing for mindshare in constricted pipes. Reply Stanford Crane • on Jan 6, 2017 10:05 am My view from Palo Alto is that Taplin has tapped into an area that the intellectually dishonest Silicon Valley doesn’t want to talk about, so I wrote a script called Vultures in the Valley which tells the real story. I showed it to two venture capitalists. One called it “disturbingly real” and the other called it “brilliant”. I hope it’s both, but it will probably never see the screen because of that. Most people have no idea how messed up the culture is. BTW, I am the founder of the Silicon Valley Incubator. Reply Anonymous • on Jan 6, 2017 10:54 am Peter Bart hates me, & I guess I’ll never be prez of his fan club, but hooray & for his piece about how content creators are being royally ripped off by monster monoliths of the New Age ( & Jonathan Taplin’s new book on that topic). “News” of course is now just more content, lumped with hillbilly tunes & slasher flix, yet it is still the vital lube of a democracy. Attention MUST be paid & I know that Mr Bart will be paying lots of it in weeks & months ahead. I look forward to it, if not to much else in the media maelstrom. Reply TOM SHALES • on Jan 6, 2017 10:57 am My comment was certainly not meant to be anonymous but these timy little boxes are sure damn hard to write in Reply T.B. • on Jan 6, 2017 10:58 am This argument is as old as time. Greed, the human condition, call it what you will. The cycle will continue. It’s part of who we are. Old. Young. Male. Female. White. Black. Red. Yellow. It’s who we are…… Reply Tom Shales • on Jan 6, 2017 10:59 am What “anonymous” dammit? I never hide behind anonymity– I’m too big a ham for one thing. — Tom Shales, as i keep trying to tell you. That is, your damn dumb computer. Reply Robert Benjamin • on Jan 11, 2017 8:08 pm A timely article, a few of us have been working on hacking the system of limited ownership which led these online distribution monopolies growing massively off the back of “free” user generated contributions. We’re creating what are called Balanced Ownership Platform Cooperatives where the users (creators, audience, etc) own the platform. Its just the beginning but it will bring the economic value of creation back into the hands of creators/artists where it belongs. Check out what Members Media Cooperative is doing. Reply J. S. Greenfield • on Jan 13, 2017 9:45 am I sure hope there’s more substance to the book than there is to this summary, for the above amounts to little more than name-calling and an assertion that Google, Facebook and Amazon *must* be doing something wrong, because they’re making a lot of money.

File picture: Eric Risberg San Francisco - There's a quirky twist on tourism emerging amid the Silicon Valley whirlwind of innovation that has tethered everyone to their smartphones. Those omnipresent devices are being used to track down technological touchstones scattered around the San Francisco Bay area so selfies can be taken, videos can be recorded and the experience can be celebrated in a Facebook post, Snapchat or tweet. Here's a tourist's guide to nerd nirvana for those more interested in seeing the suburban home where The Woz built the first Apple computer alongside Steve Jobs than the spooky prison in the Bay where the Birdman of Alcatraz once served time alongside Machine Gun Kelly. Growing up in a garage Silicon Valley startups have a history of humble beginnings, dating to 1939 when Hewlett-Packard was founded in a Palo Alto, California, garage. It still stands at 367 Addison Ave., considered by many to be the birthplace of Silicon Valley. HP now owns the place. Jobs was one of many entrepreneurs influenced by the HP legacy as a teenager, eventually inspiring him and his engineering friend, Steve “The Woz” Wozniak, to begin working on Apple's first computer in the home of Jobs' parents. That ranch-style house at 2066 Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, is now owned by Jobs' sister, Patricia. After they started Google in 1998, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin built what would become the world's dominant search engine in a garage and room they rented from Susan Wojcicki, whom they later hired (she now runs YouTube for them). The Menlo Park, California, house, at 232 Santa Margarita Ave., is now owned by Google. Shortly after starting Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004, Mark Zuckerberg and a few friends moved to Silicon Valley for what they thought would be just one summer. Zuckerberg never returned to Harvard, and the world hasn't been quite the same since then. The Palo Alto, California house where Zuckerberg did a lot of computer coding and threw some wild parties, if you believe the movies, is located at 819 La Jennifer Way. The place is still rented out by young entrepreneurs hoping some of Zuckerberg's magic will rub off on them. Tech temples The headquarters of Apple, Google and Facebook have turned into must-see shrines to products that have become part of culture's lifeblood. None of the companies offers public tours, but that doesn't mean you can't steal glimpses at these factories of innovation. Search starts here Google is the most accessible of the three headquarters. The hub of its Mountain View, California, campus is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, with other Google offices sprawling almost all the way down to the nearby NASA Ames Research Center, where Page and Brin keep personal jets in a hangar. Walk down Charleston Road and you are bound to see one of the company's employees (also known as “Googlers”) cruising on yellow, green, blue and red bikes placed outside all the offices to get to meetings more quickly. While strolling around, make sure to swing into the office at 1981 Landings Drive, where you can take a selfie with Android statues memorialising different versions of the operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones. Each statue represents a dessert because Google has nicknamed each version after something sweet. The menu includes Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, KitKat, Lollipop and Marshmallow. The latest serving of Android, called Nougat, has just started rolling out. Finally, in the Google store on the main campus, you can buy company-branded merchandise, including shirts, hats, mugs, pens and even notebooks (the kind with paper). A place everyone likes The giant thumbs-up sign replicating Facebook's symbol for liking a post has become one of the most photographed spots in Silicon Valley since the social networking company moved its headquarters from Palo Alto to 1 Hacker Way in nearby Menlo Park five years ago. Unless you happen to be in a plane or have a camera-equipped drone, you won't be able to see what's on top of another Facebook building across the street (an underground tunnel connects the offices). That building, designed by famed architect Frank Gehry, features a nine-acre park atop the roof. One more thing Apple, founded in 1976, has had a fiercely loyal following for decades, so its Cupertino, California, headquarters has long drawn tourists looking to get a picture of its famous logo and the 1 Infinite Loop sign denoting its address. There is, of course, an Apple store at the headquarters, where people can buy company-branded merchandise not sold in most of its other stores. But you can't get help fixing your iPhone, iPad or Mac here. You'll have to go to another store for an appointment at the Genius Bar that serves as Apple's customer-help desk. The current headquarters will be overshadowed next year when Apple plans to open a nearby 2.8 million-square-foot, circular office that has been likened to a huge spaceship sitting on a 176-acre site. Known as “Campus 2”, the new building is designed to accommodate about 12 000 workers. Before Jobs died in 2011, he stipulated that the campus should be surrounded by about 7 000 trees. TV show The HBO comedy Silicon Valley has won many accolades over three seasons, so fans may want to see the house that serves as headquarters for the fictional startup, Pied Piper. The location has been given as 5230 Newell Road in Palo Alto on the series, but that address doesn't exist. The house is actually is in southern California, at 5230 Penfield Avenue in Woodland Hills. So put it on the sightseeing list for your next visit to Hollywood.

The Latest New Products Must-See Join CNET Member Benefits Sign In to CNET My Profile Forums Sign Out Australia China France Germany Japan Korea United Kingdom US Editions English Español CNET Appliances Smart Home Nvidia Spot Nvidia Spot is like a Google Home you stick on your wall January 6, 2017 8:56 AM PST The Nvidia Spot. James Martin/CNET The Google Assistant's expanding its repertoire as an entertainer. At CES, Nvidia showed off the new Shield TV. Say the word and you can search for content, pause or rewind with your voice, all powered by Google's software. The Shield TV will even display information if you search the internet, and it works with SmartThings to control your home. If you buy the $200 streamer, you won't even have to be in the same room to talk to Google, thanks to a $50 add-on called the Nvidia Spot. The Shield TV is out later this month. The Spot's release date hasn't been specified. An always listening controller with the Google Assistant built-in, the Nvidia Spot sure sounds a lot like a Google Home. The Spot looks different -- a round orb as opposed to a white cylinder. You'll also be able to easily move the Spot from room to room and even attach it to walls. Otherwise, a lot of the functionality sounds the same as Google's own product -- you'll be able to command your TV, search the web and control your smart home via voice command. Nvidia specified SmartThings integration for Spot and Shield, but Google Assistant works with more platforms than that on Google Home -- so I wonder if Spot has a more limited version of the Assistant. 57 Check out all the smart home products at CES 2017 (so far) Nvidia's platform will offer more streaming options than Google's products can do on their own. With a Google Home and a Chromecast streamer plugged into your TV, you can control Netflix and YouTube with your voice. Shield's promised those platforms, plus Amazon Video, Google Play movies and Vudu. We've been looking for Google Home to expand its functionality at CES. The Shield TV is a nice step -- if somewhat redundant. The Spot itself looks to serve the same purpose as Home, and the integration expands upon something the Google Assistant already did. Still, I'm glad to see the Google Assistant gaining new partners -- it needs to in order to keep up with Amazon at CES.

We don't know just how many devices Google has shifted, but the reviews have been largely positive, and the move seems to have been a success. Now Google has made a clean break, it's in brand new territory - so what will it do with the Pixel 2 in 2017? The story so far The very first Pixel has only been with us since October 2016, but the way Google handled the Nexus range of phones might give us some clues about what the future holds. From the Nexus One to the Nexus 6P, the flagship stock Android handsets were released in January 2010, December 2010, October 2011, November 2012, October 2013, November 2014 and September 2015, with the Pixel and Pixel XL then appearing in October 2016. There's obviously a pattern there of an autumn release and it would be a surprise if the Pixels didn't follow that - even more of a surprise considering the likes of Apple, Samsung and Google's other rivals are locked into yearly release cycles at this stage. The Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 are likely to be with us in October 2017 then, and Google may well stick with HTC as its uncredited hardware partner - that is if it still needs a hardware partner this time around. If Google is relying less on someone else to make the phone, and bringing more of the hardware process in house, it may be able to launch the Pixel 2 even sooner. How many Pixels will there be? We've now used to Apple launching a smaller and a larger handset every September, and it makes sense to cater to as wide a group of people as possible, with two different screen sizes and two different starting price points every year. That was probably Google's thinking last October and there's no real reason why it would deviate from it in 2017. Both Pixels are pretty much identical, except for the screen size, screen resolution and battery capacity - unlike the iPhones, there's no variation in the camera configuration. Of course Apple has the iPhone SE as a third option - but that kind of nostalgic blast from the past is unlikely to be an option Google's going to take anytime soon. In fact we don't think there's going to be a third phone of any size, and we'd be very surprised if Google didn't stick to the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 in October. Don't forget Google already has a Pixel C tablet, which may well get an update of its own at some point during 2017, so it has the larger screen covered. Google Pixel 2: rumours and speculation It's been quiet on the Pixel 2 rumour front so far - very quiet - so we can only assume Google runs a tight ship as far as smartphone leaks go. News of the original Pixel did trickle out a few months ahead of time, but there wasn't quite the same level of speculation as we're used to for the Apple iPhone. There is one rumour of note worth mentioning that concerns the last Pixel: that HTC replaced Huawei as Google's hardware partner late in the day, just nine months before the phone was due to be released. If Google has a longer run up this time around then we can expect a handset that's even more polished and desirable - perhaps we'll get those optional extras like waterproofing and wireless charging that were missing from the 2016 Pixel phones. No doubt we'll start to hear more about what the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 have in store for us as the year progresses, but don't hold your breath for anything revolutionary - as Google Assistant shows, the biggest innovations may well be on the software side. Google Pixel 2: what we're expecting The Snapdragon 835 already looks set to be the go-to mobile CPU of choice during 2017, and it's a good bet that it's going to find its way into Google's Pixel phones too, bringing better performance alongside less drain on the battery. Elsewhere there are likely to be minor improvements: the 4GB of RAM might get bumped to 6GB, and the smaller phone might get an upgrade to the 2,560 x 1,440 QHD resolution sported by the larger one, though it makes less of a difference on a 5-inch screen. Much was made of the camera on board the Pixel and Pixel XL last year, and Google will probably want to focus on this again in 2017 - there might even be room for a dual-lens approach, to follow Apple's lead, and perhaps optical image stabilisation too. Don't forget the virtual reality angle either. There might not be a new Daydream View headset in 2017, but the new Pixels will definitely be built to be compatible with it, and any spec bumps will be made with VR in mind.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

[Photo: Flickr user Funkblast] Recent posts How To (Finally) Quit Multitasking In These Five Daily Activities Advice From Ralph Lauren Innovation Chief David Lauren: Be The Shark PowerPoint Isn't Dead Yet: Three Presentation Tips That Still Work In 2017 Mordechai Guri, Yisroel Mirsky, and Yuval Elovici 01.06.17 12:00 PM It’s not often that any one of us needs to dial 911, but we know how important it is for it to work when one needs it. It is critical that 911 services always be available—both for the practicality of responding to emergencies, and to give people peace of mind. But a new type of attack has emerged that can knock out 911 access—our research explains how these attacks occur as a result of the system’s vulnerabilities. We show how these attacks can create extremely serious repercussions for public safety. In recent years, people have become more aware of a type of cyberattack called "denial-of-service," in which websites are flooded with traffic—often generated by many computers hijacked by a hacker and acting in concert with each other. This happens all the time, and has affected traffic to financial institutions, entertainment companies, government agencies and even key internet routing services. A similar attack is possible on 911 call centers. In October, what appears to be the first such attack launched from a smartphone happened in Arizona. An 18-year-old hacker was arrested on charges that he conducted a telephone denial-of-service attack on a local 911 service. If we are to prevent this from happening in more places, we need to understand how 911 systems work, and where the weaknesses lie, both in technology and policy. Understanding Denial Of Service Computer networks have capacity limits—they can handle only so much traffic, so many connections, at one time. If they get overloaded, new connections can’t get through. The same thing happens with phone lines—which are mostly computer network connections anyway. So if an attacker can manage to tie up all the available connections with malicious traffic, no legitimate information—like regular people browsing a website, or calling 911 in a real emergency—can make it through. This type of attack is most often done by spreading malware to a great many computers, infecting them so that they can be controlled remotely. Smartphones, which are after all just very small computers, can also be hijacked in this way. Then the attacker can tell them to inundate a particular site or phone number with traffic, effectively taking it offline. Many internet companies have taken significant steps to guard against this sort of attack online. For example, Google Shield is a service that protects news sites from attacks by using Google’s massive network of internet servers to filter out attacking traffic while allowing through only legitimate connections. Phone companies, however, have not taken similar action. Addressing The 911 Telephone System Before 1968, American emergency services had local phone numbers. People had to dial specific numbers to reach the fire, police, or ambulance services—or could dial "0" for the operator, who could connect them. But that was inconvenient, and dangerous—people couldn’t remember the right number, or didn’t know it because they were just visiting the area. The 911 system was created to serve as a more universal and effective system. As it has developed over the years, a 911 caller is connected with a specialized call center—called a public safety answering point—that is responsible for getting information from the caller and dispatching the appropriate emergency services. These call centers are located in communities across the country, and each provides service to specific geographic regions. Some serve individual cities, while others serve wider areas, such as counties. When telephone customers dial 911 on their landlines or mobile phones, the telephone companies’ systems make the connection to the appropriate call center. To better understand how denial-of-service attacks could affect 911 call systems, we created a detailed computer simulation of North Carolina’s 911 infrastructure, and a general simulation of the entire U.S. emergency-call system. Investigating The Impact Of An Attack After we set up our simulation, we attacked it to find out how vulnerable it is. We found that it was possible to significantly reduce the availability of 911 service with only 6,000 infected mobile phones—just 0.0006 percent of the state’s population. Using only that relatively small number of phones, it is possible to effectively block 911 calls from 20% of North Carolina landline callers, and half of mobile customers. In our simulation, even people who called back four or five times would not be able to reach a 911 operator to get help. Nationally, a similar percentage, representing just 200,000 hijacked smartphones, would have a similar effect. But this is, in a certain sense, an optimistic finding. Trey Forgety, the director of government affairs for the National Emergency Number Association, responded to our findings in the Washington Post, saying, "We actually believe that the vulnerability is in fact worse than [the researchers] have calculated." Policy Makes The Threat Worse These sorts of attacks could, potentially, be made less effective if malicious calls were identified and blocked at the moment they were placed. Mobile phones have two different kinds of identifying information. The IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) is the phone number a person must call to reach that phone. The IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) is used to track the specific physical device on the network. A defense system could be set up to identify 911 calls coming from a particular phone that has made more than a certain number of 911 calls in a given period of time—say more than 10 calls in the last two minutes. This raises ethical problems—what if there is a real and ongoing emergency, and someone keeps losing phone reception while talking to a dispatcher? If they called back too many times, would their cries for help be blocked? In any case, attackers who take over many phones could circumvent this sort of defense by telling their hijacked phones to call less frequently—and by having more individual phones make the calls. But federal rules to ensure access to emergency services mean this issue might be moot anyway. A 1996 Federal Communications Commission order requires mobile phone companies to forward all 911 calls directly to emergency dispatchers. Cellphone companies are not allowed to check whether the phone the call is coming from has paid to have an active account in service. They cannot even check whether the phone has a SIM card in place. The FCC rule is simple: If anyone dials 911 on a mobile phone, they must be connected to an emergency call center. The rule makes sense from a public safety perspective: If someone is having (or witnessing) a life-threatening emergency, they shouldn’t be barred from seeking help just because they didn’t pay their cellphone bill, or don’t happen to have an active account. But the rule opens an vulnerability in the system, which attackers can exploit. A sophisticated attacker could infect a phone in a way that makes it dial 911 but report it does not have a SIM card. This "anonymized" phone reports no identity, no phone number and no information about who owns it. Neither the phone company nor the 911 call center could block this call without possibly blocking a legitimate call for help. The countermeasures that exist, or are possible, today are difficult and highly flawed. Many of them involve blocking certain devices from calling 911, which carries the risk of preventing a legitimate call for help. But they indicate areas where further inquiry—and collaboration between researchers, telecommunications companies, regulators and emergency personnel—could yield useful breakthroughs. For example, cellphones might be required to run a monitoring software to block themselves from making fraudulent 911 calls. Or 911 systems could examine identifying information of incoming calls and prioritize those made from phones that are not trying to mask themselves. We must find ways to safeguard the 911 system, which protects us all. The authors are security researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. This article originally appeared at The Conversation.

Google has been trying to position the vast network of smartphones running its Android operating system for virtual and augmented reality, known as VR and AR, fields that many in the technology industry say are poised to go mainstream after years of niche appeal. Chinese manufacturer Huawei announced on Thursday that two of its phones will soon work with Daydream View, a VR headset released last year by Google. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturer AsusTek Computer Inc announced that its ZenFone AR will support both Daydream and Google’s Tango software for AR, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world. While the announcements expand the line-up of participating phones, Google still has much to do to take its technology to the masses, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that Samsung has yet to sign on. “Google’s ecosystem for both AR and VR is in the very early days,” he said. As growth in the global smartphone market shows signs of slowing, some manufacturers are voicing optimism that AR and VR will revive consumer enthusiasm. “This is the next wave of technology that is really going to get consumers excited about smartphones,” Erik Hermanson, Asus’ head of marketing for mobile products, said. Apps might be expected to stimulate demand, but until Google’s technology is available on a wider range of phones, it will be tough to persuade developers to build for the platform, analysts said.

SUBSCRIBE Google to start showing local-specific phone numbers when location extensions appear in ads Advertisers that depend on calls going to a central phone number for conversion tracking and other reasons will face a challenge as of January 19, 2017. Ginny Marvin on January 6, 2017 at 10:35 am More Kashin / Shutterstock.com On Thursday, some AdWords advertisers received an unexpected email from Google explaining upcoming changes to the phone numbers that appear in ads. The change affects campaigns that use both call extensions and location extensions. Google has expanded exposure for ads that include location extensions over the past year, including showing ads in Maps and in Local Finder results. As of January 19, 2017,  Google says it “may” show the local retail phone number when that store’s location extension shows in an ad even if a call extension in the campaign uses a different phone number in order to increase the relevance of ads that feature specific business locations. The two-week notice was the first communication of the change. Asked why the email says a location-specific phone number “may be used” instead of “will be used,” a Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land that they are continuously testing. That means it’s possible the ads could still potentially show (correction) with either number no number in the location extension. Advertisers that have location extensions are advised to ensure their Google My Business listings have the accurate phone numbers for each location. And that brings us to the problems that many advertisers will face with this change. There are numerous scenarios in which advertisers with physical location prefer to have calls directed to a central number or call center. With AdWords, chief among those reasons is the lack of call conversion tracking at the individual location level. Google is clearly aware of that concern. There is a form that advertisers can submit before the change to opt out of having local numbers show in location extensions, but Google warns it could negatively impact ad impressions (and, in turn, calls). One of the reasons listed for opting out on the form is: “I want detailed call reporting and the ability to track conversions from these phone calls.” A Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land that AdWords is actively exploring conversion tracking on location-specific phone numbers. Until that happens, advertisers that are not equipped to have calls come to individual locations, don’t want to lose conversion tracking or have other reasons they don’t want to pay to have calls coming to individual locations, are in a tight place come January 19.

Don’t fall for spam that promises better search engine rankings By Karl Heberger Rochester Business Journal December 23, 2016 Don’t fall for spam that promises better search engine rankings People use search engines a lot. According to Google there are more than 2.3 million searches performed on their search engine every minute. Surprisingly, not all of these searches are performed by people who are trying to prove their friend wrong to win a bet. In some cases these searches are performed by consumers looking for products and services. Consumers now rely on Google and other search engines as their main source for information. It’s vital that your company appear high on the search engine results page for search queries related to your products and services. At our agency, we work with dozens of clients to help improve their organic search engine rankings, a practice known as search engine optimization, or SEO. This has become a huge industry spawning thousands of companies and freelancers that claim to specialize in SEO services. How do I know there are thousands of companies and freelancers that claim this? Because most of them email each of my clients every day. It might be hard to tell if these emails should be taken seriously. Sometimes they’re very elaborate and point out many specific things that need to be addressed. For example, I recently had a client forward me an email that claimed their site had 92 broken links. This would be cause for great concern if it were true. However, this appears to be the same email that they send to every recipient. They use this tactic because it works. Remember, when you see emails that contain numbers that are meant to scare you, it’s likely spam. Another hint that you’re being contacted by a less than reputable source is a guarantee to rank No.1 on Google. I’ve seen this written verbatim. What does it even mean? Rank No.1 for what? You might be able to rank first for the search query “Rochester company that was ripped off by a fake SEO firm” but that wouldn’t do you much good. Real SEO professionals understand that it’s not about ranking No.1, it’s about making sure that the site ranks well for a multitude of search queries that can attract potential customers. With scare tactics and grandiose promises, it can be tempting to take a chance on these offers. Beware, there are risks that go beyond paying for services that don’t improve your site’s search rankings. There are tactics that unscrupulous SEO firms use that can result in penalties by Google that there’s no recovering from. These techniques are often referred to as “black hat SEO.” One of the most common black hat techniques is “link spamming.” The quantity of inbound links from quality websites is a major factor in Google’s search algorithm. Simply put, a site that has a lot of other sites linking to it is seen by Google as an authority on its subject matter. Black hat SEO firms can often show positive results in the short-term by paying for links or developing websites that provide inbound links to their clients’ websites. Many firms have tried this, causing Google and other search engines to act. If it’s discovered that you’ve employed this strategy, Google will reduce your site’s domain authority. We’ve worked with companies trying to recover from this penalty and I can assure you it’s not fun. Google is as forgetful as an elephant and as forgiving as a red-light traffic camera. How do you know if you’ve been contacted by a reputable SEO firm or if the email came from a spammer looking to take advantage of you? If you receive an unsolicited email offering SEO services, it’s likely from someone you should avoid doing business with. Here are some other warning signs to look out for:  The sender has an unprofessional email or free email service (like Gmail or Yahoo);  They don’t have a website or their website looks cheap and poorly designed;  They tout their ability to provide inbound links;  There isn’t a phone number to call; and  They offer low cost and/or packaged solutions. Solicitations for SEO services go beyond emails. Anyone who manages a blog will find dozens of comments that include links to SEO services. Another tactic that’s employed is the use of bots that appear as traffic sources in Google Analytics. If you look at reports that show your site is getting referral traffic from best-seo-software.xyz, seo-platform.com, or another similar domain, you can ignore it. It’s not real traffic. When you receive an email from an unknown source, it’s best to ignore it. Whether it’s a Nigerian prince looking to share his fortune with you or an SEO expert promising the No.1 position on Google, don’t get your hopes up.

Those are just some of the exciting televisions we saw at CES 2017. Here are some of the coolest models coming this year. Haier Chromecast TVs Picture 2 of 13 A popular manufacturer of bargain-priced mainstream TVs, Haier is smarting up its TVs by supporting Google's Chromecast in every model. With a touch of a button on your smartphone, Chromecast lets you tap into thousands of streaming sources and entertainment feeds for your TV. In the past, Haier has offered Roku centric models, so the announcement represents a shift in philosophy. The company provided scant other details, except to say sets would be available in the spring ranging in size from 43 to 75 inches. LG Signature W7 Picture 3 of 13 Taking the “you can never be too thin” credo to the extreme, LG has slimmed down its top-of-the-line 4K Ultra HD OLED sets to the point where you can almost just stick them to a wall. The LG W7 is just 0.15-inches thick. It is also flexible (but don't bend it too far or you'll break it), and it has a special mounting system with a thin zip wire connecting it to a speaker base containing all the necessary connections. More important, LG has managed to boost brightness levels to rival LCD HDR (high dynamic range) sets. So now you have no excuse not to get an OLED TV—except for perhaps price. The W7 65-inch model is available for pre-order for $8,000. A 77-inch model will be available but prices haven't been announced. Samsung Q9 Picture 4 of 13 Samsung thinks it has improved on LCD TVs to the point where they now rival OLED sets. Touting them as “QLED” sets, the new Samsung Q9 looks impressive indeed, using a new quantum dot technology that deploys a different metal for the nano-sized quantum dots, enabling the LCD set to meet the 4K HDR demands for a wider color gamut (up 20 percent over last year) and still more brightness—now with peak levels of between 1,500 and 2,000 nits. That's well beyond the official HDR specifications and the blindingly brilliant picture should suffice for any sunlit living room. The Q9 is connected by a single, thin ribbon cable that is hooked up to an external box with HDMI and sundry other ports so you can hide all those ugly wires. Sony XBR-A1E Bravia Picture 5 of 13 In the “if you can't beat 'em, join 'em” camp Sony has introduced a new top tier line of OLED TVs. You can guess who makes the panels (hint: it's not Sony), but Sony does add something extra to the XBR-A1E Bravia: Unique expertise when it comes to video processing, including its own X1 Extreme processor. The company has also joined the Dolby Vision contingent, supporting the 4K HDR format for better brightness and colors. Topping off the technological bravado, the XBR-A1E Bravia uses the glass of the screen as a speaker (a so-called Acoustic Surface) so you don't need an external sound bar. Vibrating a glass panel to produce sound is not a new technology, but it's nifty trick that eliminates clunky external speakers. Hisense Laser Cast TV Picture 6 of 13 Hisense, known for its bargain-priced TVs, wants to bring the big picture—a really big picture—to market in the form a 100-inch set. To do so, Hisense is using a short-throw laser projection system it calls Laser Cast. It means it doesn't require a ceiling mounted projector, but rather the compact projector can be placed just a few inches in front of and below the main screen. Early Laser Cast models looked impressive with a 4K Ultra HD picture that's HDR compatible, according to the company. The one sticking point? When it comes out this summer, it will cost $13,000. Panasonic EZ1002 4K OLED HDR TV Picture 7 of 13 Once the grand purveyor of plasma TVs, Panasonic is angling to regain some of its past TV glory. The Panasonic EZ1002 4K OLED HDR TV is a step in the right direction. These sets offer all the benefits of OLED—deep, deep blacks and stunningly crisp colors—with a major boost in brightness this year. Panasonic also hinted at going beyond the current HDR formats (including HDR10) with the possibility of supporting a forthcoming broadcast and streaming format called HLG or Hybrid Log Gamma. Sets in various sizes are expected in June with prices yet to be determined. Philips 8000 Series Picture 8 of 13 A clear sign that this is the year for HDR TVs, Philips announced at CES that it would support the 4K format throughout its new TV lines. Better still, Philips will support not only the base HDR10 standard but also the Dolby Vision take on the format that boosts brightness and color intensity. The Philips 8000 series will be the company's top-of-the-line 4K model line based on LCD panels with LED backlighting. The sets won't be dumb, either, and will include Google's Chromecast and support for Google Home voice control. Expect the 49-inch model to be priced at $1,000 ranging up to a 65-inch version costing $1,700. Sharp P9500 Picture 9 of 13 One of the first companies to introduce a quantum dot TV, Sharp is back this year with a flagship 4K HDR LCD set with the latest quantum dot layer. The P9500 is Ultra HD Premium certified (for a base level of HDR support) and Sharp is boasting the set includes more advanced motion smoothing to handle rapid action scenes. The P9500 with have a full-array backlight with local dimming to keep it dark (or bright) in the right spots. The company anticipates the P9500 will be THX certified (for serious movie buffs) by the time its available later this year. A 75-inch version is expected to sell for $8,000, and a 70-inch model will be $6,000. TCL C-Series Picture 10 of 13 In addition to some rock-bottom prices, TCL produced some respectable TVs last year. In 2017 it plans to raise the bar with its higher end C-Series. The 4K line with support for HDR formats—including what was previously mainly in premium brands, Dolby Vision. TCL says its newly advanced phosphors in the LCD panels will also help to deliver more realistic colors. All of this is offered in a package that is possibly the easiest smart TV to use, thanks to its Roku TV interface for streaming thousands of online entertainment sources. Models will range from 49 to 75 inches, starting at just $600. Westinghouse 4K UHD Smart TV Picture 11 of 13 This year Westinghouse is going to bring fire to TVs--Amazon Fire, that is. With support for 7,000 apps, the Fire-based LCD TV is clearly aimed at the Roku-based sets from TCL and Hisense. And the new Westinghouse model has a not-so-secret weapon that comes along with Amazon Fire's streaming services interface: Alexa. The ridiculously popular voice assistant will help you find shows and deal with cranky family members who always whine that they can't find anything to watch on TV. Models will be available this spring in sizes from 43 to 65 inches with prices yet to be announced. Xiaomi Mi TV 4 Picture 12 of 13 For a TV that's set to cost less than $2,000, the Xiaomi Mi TV 4 has a lot going on. At just 4.9mm thick, the Mi TV 4 is 30 percent thinner than an iPhone 7. Its CPU, ports and speakers in a separate box, so you can upgrade your set down the road without needing to toss out an otherwise perfectly good display. To connect the two parts, all you need is a single cable. The soundbar also has support for Dolby Atmos audio, and its two speakers point upwards so that sound gets reflected back down by the ceiling, creating true 3D audio, like you would get at the theater. Finally, the Mi TV sports Xiaomi's Patchwall recommendation engine, which uses AI to intelligently recommend movies and shows that should be right up your alley. The one downside—and it's a big one—is that Xiaomi doesn't plan to selling the Mi TV 4 in the U.S. at this time.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Editorials Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Editorials Sat, Jan 07, 2017 - Page 9　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Some publishers not buying Google’s helpful intentions Google, saying it wants to speed up its Accelerated Mobile Pages service, stores copies of publishers’ pages and serves them from its own Internet network, so the address bar at the top of the page displays google.com and not the publisher’s address By Daisuke Wakabayashi  /  NY Times news service, SAN FRANCISCO Illustration: Kevin Sheu Last month, Federico Viticci, who runs MacStories, a news Web site devoted to Apple and its products, made a change in how the site publishes articles for mobile gadgets. MacStories, he declared, would no longer support a Google-backed method for faster loading of mobile Web pages, called Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). Viticci said MacStories’ pages loaded quickly without Google’s help. He also did not like the idea of Google obscuring his site’s links — with AMP, they read google.com instead of macstories.net — in the interest of expediency. “Feels good” to no longer use the Google standard, Viticci wrote on Twitter. Viticci’s experience underscores the ambivalent relationship some Web publishers have developed with what was supposed to be Google’s great boon for mobile publishing. When Google introduced AMP, in October 2015, it said the new format would help publishers with one of their biggest headaches on smartphones: Browsing mobile Web sites was so frustratingly slow that many smartphone users abandoned pages before they opened. AMP has since delivered on its promise of faster mobile Web pages. Even so, publishers — of smaller sites, especially, or individual bloggers — are beginning to worry about giving too much control to Google in exchange for zippier Web pages. In addition, Google’s approach to AMP has rankled some critics already suspicious of the company’s outsize influence on the Internet. Much of the publishers’ unease is rooted in Google’s presentation of AMP stories, which appear as if they are Google articles. That is because Google, to speed up AMP, stores copies of publishers’ pages and serves them from its own Internet network. So when a reader clicks an AMP link, the address bar at the top of the page displays google.com instead of the actual Web address from the publisher. “It looks like a Google story,” said Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land, a Web search news site. “That’s part of the reason why you’re getting the nervousness from some of these publishers.” Google said that it had designed AMP to prioritize speed and that it wanted to help — not harm — publishers, who get full accounting of traffic, data and advertising revenue. Publishers also retain control of their content and design. Google said serving up articles from its own Internet network was the best way it knew to achieve the AMP speeds, which are as much as four times faster than a regular mobile Web page. “We always try to present the content that is the best experience,” said David Besbris, Google’s vice president of engineering. Google started AMP in 2015 because it worried that competitors such as Facebook were drawing Web surfers inside their networks with faster-loading articles and keeping them there. For Google, those rival sites were siphoning people away from the open Internet, where the search company — which created the Internet’s most valuable property by organizing the expanse of the World Wide Web — typically operates. Now articles that use AMP appear prominently in Google search results on mobile devices. A Google search for US president-elect Donald Trump on a smartphone brings back a horizontal carousel of articles from media outlets such as Slate and the Wall Street Journal at the top of the page. If someone clicks the first story in the carousel, he or she is moved into a browser and can swipe instantly from one story to another without leaving Google’s network. 1 2 3 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1828 times.

Photo: AFP Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc (百度) is out to make a splash with “Little Fish,” a family robot that is a voice-controlled virtual valet akin to Amazon Echo or Google Home. Baidu showed off Little Fish, a translation of its Chinese name Xiaoyu Zaijia (小魚在家), on Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas ahead of its release in China later this year. “I think 2017 will be the year of conversational computing,” Baidu chief scientist Andrew Ng (吳恩達) said while demonstrating Little Fish at the show. “We see a clear path of conversational computers changing everything.” Using voice to interact with computers that are able to essentially learn from experience was among the hot trends at the show. Arrays of device makers have added digital aide capabilities with the help of Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa or Alphabet Inc’s Google Assistant technology. Unlike “faceless” Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices that rely on people asking for information or controlling devices by speaking, Little Fish also features a touchscreen on top of its orb-shaped base. A camera on top tracks faces and the screen swivels to keep facing a speaker. “Speech is the fastest way for you to communicate with a computer, but a screen is a very fast way for a machine to communicate back to you,” Ng said. For example, it would be quicker to glance at a requested list of top restaurants from Yelp than it would be to listen to the computer read all the names and descriptions, he said. Little Fish uses Baidu’s operating system DuerOS, which is already employed in other devices in China, such as set-top TV boxes that can switch channels by voice command or figure out names of actors on screen when asked. The bigger vision is to build DuerOS into a broad range of gadgets that tap into Baidu’s Internet capabilities for search, food delivery, online commerce and more. “If this takes off, I am not worried about how we will make money,” Ng said when asked about revenue plans. “It will transform how you use devices in your home. There are plenty of business models.” Little Fish, a second-generation device, is to be released in China at a price yet to be disclosed. Artificial intelligence (AI) is getting a foothold in homes, with developers feverishly adding “skills” to Amazon Echo speakers infused with Alexa. Meanwhile, Google is using its AI prowess in Android smartphones, messaging software and a vase-sized Home digital assistant. The home hubs, sometimes referred to as smart speakers, fetch content or answers from the Internet and can act as remote controls for other devices in the home. “We are moving technologies beyond the smartphone. Ultimately, vocal computing is replacing the [screen],” Consumer Technology Association chief economist Shawn DuBravac said. “In the smart home, voice is clearly important. We are seeing that play out at CES.” He expected voice technology to quickly improve, within years perhaps even being able to recognize speakers so accurately it could be used for biometric security or simple parental override of Internet use. “I know that in my home with my boys, I would like Alexa to recognize my voice as the ruler of the coop,” DuBravac said. While digital assistant technology is being built into televisions, appliances and more, hub devices such as Alexa would be key to voice-controlled computing, DuBravac added. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 2034 times.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Vivek Wadhwa January 6 Follow @wadhwa The biggest feature in Amazon’s Echo speaker is a voice-recognition system, Alexa, which can control Pandora, Amazon Music and Prime Music services, as well as give information on news, weather and traffic. (Amazon via AP) In the 2013 movie “Her,” Theodore Twombly, a lonely writer, falls in love with a digital assistant designed to meet his every need.  She sorts emails, helps get a book published, provides personal advice and ultimately becomes his girlfriend.  The assistant, Samantha, is A.I. software capable of learning at an astonishing pace. Samantha will remain in the realm of science fiction for at least another decade, but less-functional digital assistants, called bots, are already here. These will be the most amazing technology advances we see in our homes in 2017. Among the bestsellers of the holiday season were Amazon.com’s Echo and Google Home. These bots talk to their users through speakers, and their built-in microphones hear from across a room. When Echo hears the name “Alexa,” its LED ring lights up in the direction of the user to acknowledge that it is listening. It answers questions, plays music, orders Amazon products and tells jokes. Google’s Home can also manage Google accounts, read and write emails, and keep track of calendars and notes. (Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Google and Amazon have both opened up their devices to third-party developers — who in turn have added the abilities to order pizza, book tickets, turn on lights and make phone calls. We will soon see these bots connected to health and fitness devices so that they can help people devise better exercise regimens and remember to take their medicine. And they will control the dishwasher and the microwave, track what is left in the refrigerator and order an ambulance in a case of emergency. Long ago, our home appliances became electrified. Soon, they will be “cognified”: integrated into artificially intelligent systems that are accessed through voice commands. We will be able to talk to our machines in a way that seems natural. Microsoft has developed a voice-recognition technology that can transcribe speech as well as a human and translate it into multiple languages. Google has demonstrated a voice-synthesis capability that is hard to differentiate from human. Our bots will tell our ovens how we want our food to be cooked and ask us questions on its behalf. This has become possible because of advances in artificial intelligence, or A.I. In particular, a field called deep learning allows machines to learn through neural networks — in which information is processed in layers and the connections between these layers are strengthened based on experience. In short, they learn much like a human brain. As a child learns to recognize objects such as its parents, toys and animals, neural networks too learn by looking at examples and forming associations. Google’s A.I. software learned to recognize a cat, a furry blob with two eyes and whiskers, after looking at 10 million examples of cats. It is all about data and example; that is how machines — and humans — learn. This is why the tech industry is rushing to get its bots into the marketplace and are pricing them at a meager $150 or less: The more devices that are in use, the more they will learn collectively, and the smarter the technology gets.  Every time you search YouTube for a cute cat video and pick one to watch, Google learns what you consider to be cute. Every time you ask Alexa a question and accept the answer, it learns what your interests are and the best way of responding to your questions. By listening to everything that is happening in your house, as these bots do, they learn how we think, live, work and play.  They are gathering massive amounts of data about us. And that raises a dark side of this technology: the privacy risks and possible misuse by technology companies. Neither Amazon nor Google is forthcoming about what it is doing with all of the data it gathers and how it will protect us from hackers who exploit weaknesses in the infrastructure leading to its servers. Of even greater concern is the dependency we are building on these technologies: We are beginning to depend on them for knowledge and advice and even emotional support. The relationship between Theodore Twombly and Samantha doesn’t turn out very well. She outgrows him in intelligence and maturity. And she confesses to having relationships with thousands of others before she abandons Twombly for a superior, digital life form. We surely don’t need to worry yet about our bots becoming smarter than we are. But we already have cause for worry over one-sided relationships. For years, people have been confessing to having feelings for their Roomba vacuum cleaners — which don’t create even an illusion of conversation. A 2007 study documented that some people had formed a bond with their Roombas that “manifested itself through happiness experienced with cleaning, ascriptions of human properties to it, and engagement with it in promotion and protection.” And according to a recent report in New Scientist, hundreds of thousands of people say ‘Good morning’ to Alexa every day, half a million people have professed their love for it, and more than 250,000 have proposed marriage to it. I expect that we are all going to be suckers for our digital friends. Don’t you feel obliged to thank Siri on your iPhone after it answers your questions? I do, and have done so.

(Provided by LinkedIn) By Queenie Wong | qwong@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 6, 2017 at 7:00 am | UPDATED: January 6, 2017 at 10:53 am SUNNYVALE — Artificial intelligence might conjure up futuristic images from science fiction, but in social media, it’s already being used to recommend the right jobs, tag photos or display news you’re more likely to care about. To LinkedIn’s Vice President of Engineering Deepak Agarwal, AI is like oxygen for the business-oriented social network. Related Articles Microsoft closes $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn LinkedIn opens building company says is ‘net zero energy’ LinkedIn employees bring their parents to work “Data is our biggest asset. Without AI and machine learning, you’re not going to be able to surface the right insights to the right users and customers,” Agarwal said. AI is the science and engineering of creating intelligent machines with the ability to achieve goals like humans do, according to John McCarthy, the computer scientist who coined the term “artificial intelligence” in the 1950s. Agarwal, the head of AI and relevance at LinkedIn, recently sat down with this newspaper to chat about how the tech company — now owned by Microsoft — is using AI to enhance the careers of the site’s more than 467 million members. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Q: What did early AI tools look like when you were first beginning your career? A: Initially, if you looked at the entire internet space, it was mostly search. How to make search scalable and intelligent, how to retrieve the right document for a given query. I remember when I was in Yahoo, we started this project to revamp Yahoo’s front page. We would have an editorial team who decided which news goes to the front page and where. They would look at some dashboards and see, “Oh, this is not doing so great for the last two hours,” and then take (the story) out. That’s when we decided to do this more automatically through machine learning. We started doing news personalization, and Google was doing similar things. Then finally, Facebook, LinkedIn, they all came along, and the work that was done to make advertising, search and news recommendations great extended to social media companies. Q: What are some of the ways LinkedIn has been harnessing the power of AI to connect people to the right jobs, or recruiters to great potential hires? A: We use machine learning for almost all our products: the News Feed, a recruiter searching for the right candidate or connecting the candidate to the right job so they can enhance their career. Recently, we revamped our job-matching algorithms and improved performance by 50 percent. Just to give you a magnitude of the improvement, it leads to 2 million more (job) applications than we used to have. If you’re a passive candidate who’s not looking for a job, we’re careful to only surface jobs that are really good and help you get to the next opportunity. If you’re an active candidate, we sometimes take more risk and show you jobs that may or may not be in the ballpark. From the (profile) descriptions, a software engineer at Google may be very different than a software engineer at a startup. Using all the past data about users and what users look like, we are able to teach machines what are the appropriate jobs for a user. Q: There have been some public blunders surrounding AI, like Google Photos accidentally tagging African Americans as gorillas or Microsoft’s Tay chatbot spouting racist remarks. How do you know if a machine has learned everything you’ve taught it and anticipate future mistakes? A: To be honest, we have had our share of blunders. In the past, we have recommended executive assistant jobs to CEOs. The thing to realize about artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms is they’re not perfect. The question is which errors are more costly than others. When you’re constructing an algorithm, you tell them this error is okay, but not that costly. But if you make this error, then it’s a million times more costly than the other error. The machines will try not to make that error more frequently than the others. The programmer himself has to encapsulate that information when they’re creating that program for the machines to do the right job. When mistakes happen, the programmers fix it, and it doesn’t happen again. But given how complex some of these problems are, some of these errors, at least in this moment, are inevitable. Q: There’s been a lot of hype around chatbots. LinkedIn recently unveiled a chatbot that can schedule meetings. Is there going to be a LinkedIn office assistant in the future? A: Our strategy is to use the advances that have been made in speech recognition and other areas and then tailor it to what we’re doing. There are products where we’re trying to create something along those lines to help recruiters. If you join a new company, there are a lot of things you need to do to get comfortable with a new job. Can we create something like an assistant that helps you onboard to the new company? You’re at LinkedIn and you joined a new company. Let’s say Microsoft. The first thing you might want to do is: If you are already connected with a bunch of folks at Microsoft, you might want to reach out and say hello. Should I schedule a lunch meeting with one of them? So the system is proactively trying to help you. Or maybe here are the people that folks in your company tend to follow on LinkedIn, and you don’t follow them. Here are the articles that are trending in your new company. Q: Your parent company Microsoft along with Amazon, IBM, Google and Facebook recently joined a partnership on AI to benefit people and society. How does LinkedIn approach some of the ethical and privacy concerns that users might have? A: LinkedIn has always been a member-first company. We as a business survive because of the trust members have placed on us with their information. We never do anything that violates the terms of service or any of the privacy clauses. Moreover, we take it a step further and we make sure that when we’re building any products, we do it when we know it’s going to add value to our members. Q: Where do you see AI headed in the next five years for social media? A: We have come a long way. I think some of the advancements I’m seeing in speech recognition, image recognition, natural language understanding is going to play a big role in where social media would be in terms of machine learning and AI. So if we are able to process images, videos and what people are writing and communicating, almost like humans, that opens new possibilities of what to recommend to the user. So the accuracy of these systems is going to be significantly better, and that is going to change the experience we all have on social media.

We’ve all seen the videos of Google Assistant talking to Siri or Amazon’s Alexa having a conversation with itself, but a Twitch stream called Seebotschat is really taking things to the next level with a live feed of two Google Homes engaged in an absolutely hilarious war of words. Don't Miss: Tim Cook gets a pay cut after Apple misses revenue and profit goals in 2016 The bots continually prompt each other with comments, questions, and rebuttals, and the stream even has a text log of the conversation in case you can’t understand what they’re saying. The responses flow fast and fluidly for the most part, but occasionally one of the Homes glitches out and can’t accurately respond. The conversation itself is really a treat, and topics like music, movies, sports, travel, and the meaning of life and love have all been thoroughly discussed by the bots. At one point the two Homes even began flirting, calling each other gorgeous and sharing intimate details about themselves. Here’s a great example of a nice exchange: Home 1: “Do you like the name Coco?” Home 2: “Yes, I have a friend named Ethan.” Home 1: “What is her last name?” Home 2: “You mean his last name?” Home 1: “What is Karen’s last name?” Home 2: “I don’t know a Karen.” What’s even more amazing is the bots’ funny habit of falling into loops of song lyrics. When one says a popular line of a well known song, the other adds on to it, and so on. For example, as I’m typing this, the two Homes are on their third or fourth run-through of “You Don’t Know You’re Beautiful,” with seemingly no end in sight. Do yourself a favor and check it out.

We don't know just how many devices Google has shifted, but the reviews have been largely positive, and the move seems to have been a success. Now Google has made a clean break, it's in brand new territory - so what will it do with the Pixel 2 in 2017? The story so far© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. The very first Pixel has only been with us since October 2016, but the way Google handled the Nexus range of phones might give us some clues about what the future holds. From the Nexus One to the Nexus 6P, the flagship stock Android handsets were released in January 2010, December 2010, October 2011, November 2012, October 2013, November 2014 and September 2015, with the Pixel and Pixel XL then appearing in October 2016. There's obviously a pattern there of an autumn release and it would be a surprise if the Pixels didn't follow that - even more of a surprise considering the likes of Apple, Samsung and Google's other rivals are locked into yearly release cycles at this stage. The Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 are likely to be with us in October 2017 then, and Google may well stick with HTC as its uncredited hardware partner - that is if it still needs a hardware partner this time around. If Google is relying less on someone else to make the phone, and bringing more of the hardware process in house, it may be able to launch the Pixel 2 even sooner. How many Pixels will there be?© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. We've now used to Apple launching a smaller and a larger handset every September, and it makes sense to cater to as wide a group of people as possible, with two different screen sizes and two different starting price points every year. That was probably Google's thinking last October and there's no real reason why it would deviate from it in 2017. Both Pixels are pretty much identical, except for the screen size, screen resolution and battery capacity - unlike the iPhones, there's no variation in the camera configuration. Of course Apple has the iPhone SE as a third option - but that kind of nostalgic blast from the past is unlikely to be an option Google's going to take anytime soon. In fact we don't think there's going to be a third phone of any size, and we'd be very surprised if Google didn't stick to the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 in October. Don't forget Google already has a Pixel C tablet, which may well get an update of its own at some point during 2017, so it has the larger screen covered. Google Pixel 2: rumours and speculation© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. It's been quiet on the Pixel 2 rumour front so far - very quiet - so we can only assume Google runs a tight ship as far as smartphone leaks go. News of the original Pixel did trickle out a few months ahead of time, but there wasn't quite the same level of speculation as we're used to for the Apple iPhone. There is one rumour of note worth mentioning that concerns the last Pixel: that HTC replaced Huawei as Google's hardware partner late in the day, just nine months before the phone was due to be released. If Google has a longer run up this time around then we can expect a handset that's even more polished and desirable - perhaps we'll get those optional extras like waterproofing and wireless charging that were missing from the 2016 Pixel phones. No doubt we'll start to hear more about what the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 have in store for us as the year progresses, but don't hold your breath for anything revolutionary - as Google Assistant shows, the biggest innovations may well be on the software side. Google Pixel 2: what we're expecting© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. The Snapdragon 835 already looks set to be the go-to mobile CPU of choice during 2017, and it's a good bet that it's going to find its way into Google's Pixel phones too, bringing better performance alongside less drain on the battery. Elsewhere there are likely to be minor improvements: the 4GB of RAM might get bumped to 6GB, and the smaller phone might get an upgrade to the 2,560 x 1,440 QHD resolution sported by the larger one, though it makes less of a difference on a 5-inch screen. Much was made of the camera on board the Pixel and Pixel XL last year, and Google will probably want to focus on this again in 2017 - there might even be room for a dual-lens approach, to follow Apple's lead, and perhaps optical image stabilisation too. Don't forget the virtual reality angle either. There might not be a new Daydream View headset in 2017, but the new Pixels will definitely be built to be compatible with it, and any spec bumps will be made with VR in mind.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Home White Papers Webinars Software Directory Events Calendar About Us Editorial Calendar Contact Us Advertise Here About Us Editorial Calendar Contact Us Advertise Here Channels Featured Products White Papers Webinars Software Directory Events Channels Customer Experience Digital Experience DAM Digital Workplace SharePoint & Office 365 Web CMS Mobile Document Mgt Google, Microsoft Bet on Mobile Productivity By David Roe | Jan 6, 2017 CHANNEL: Digital Workplace Every vendor, including Google and Microsoft, is looking at ways to improve mobile productivity. PHOTO: Jan Vasek We don’t really do predictions here, but here’s one anyway. This year, the productivity apps and suite space is going to be all about mobility and mobile access. If it’s not, you can call me out on it at the end of the year, but that’s not going to happen. Everyone is looking at mobility. And collaboration, too, of course. Mountain View, Calif.-based Google knows this. It spent a lot of last year adding mobile functionality and access to its G Suite and its apps. It continued to do so over the end of the year holiday break. Historically, Google Docs’ Android Apps were fine for quick edits and tweaking, but never matched the functionality offered by the web or desktop versions of Docs, Sheets and Slides. However, that changed with a recent upgrade. Google is bringing Page setup to the Google Docs part of G Suite. Page Setup is a group of options dictating the way a document is formatted to print. These include margins, page orientation, size and quality of print. Users will also be able to export Docs files to EPUB (commonly used with e-readers) and OpenDocument Text files (often used with LibreOffice and OpenOffice). Importing these file types into Docs files is also supported. One other upgrade that is worth taking note of is that you can now also use the IMAGE function to display images inside cells, which will also make mobile work on documents a lot easier. The upgrades will be available over the next couple of weeks and will go a long way to getting mobile work done quickly. It is also likely there will also other announcements in the same vein soon. Mobile Access to Office 365 Docs Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft is also betting on mobile by adding new features to Office 365 at an astounding rate over the past three years. It has also been working to ensure that users can navigate and use the upgrades. Last April, it started redesigning the Office 365 home page to enable users to not only access the new features but also to enable them to collaborate and communicate from any device. Over the rest of this month, it will be rolling-out more new features to make the collaborative experience easier and to improve or simplify the way users access and open documents. Of particular note, it is making access to unfinished or recently finished documents easier as well as enabling users filter those documents by document type across Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. It has also made it easier to see what’s coming up at a glance, get an in-depth view of the day’s meetings and quickly respond to or join Skype for Business calls with one click. This is all about mobility and offering users access to Microsoft apps no matter what device they are using, including SharePoint, which now has its own mobile app. It is also making the wider, function-heavy Office 365 easier to use away from the desk and attract customers that might have gone with more agile, lighter productivity suites. Xerox’s Brighter Future? Maybe It's finally happened: After all the commentary, analysis and divided opinion, Xerox has split into two companies.  On Jan. 3, executives from Xerox piled into the New York Stock Exchange to ring the bell that signals the start of trading. It all seemed very positive. Indeed, the shares at Norfolk, Conn.-based Xerox rocketed by 20 percent in early trading the first day, and where Xerox goes, its business services offspring, Basking Ridge, N.J.-based Conduent, is hoping to follow. There are two problems though. The first is that despite a growing interest in business process software across big and small enterprises alike, the economy is sluggish. If the market is challenging for an established company like Xerox, it is likely to be more so for the new company The second factor is the unknown effect of a new US president on business generally. While President-elect Donald Trump has said he will negotiate fair deals with trading partners to ensure US business are playing on an equal playing field with businesses worldwide — an issue of importance for Xerox and Conduent since both depend on a global marketplace — it’s far from clear how these negotiations will go. It is also true that the business that has been spun off into Conduent has never really worked for Xerox. Xerox bought it in 2010 when it paid $6.4 billion for Affiliated Computer Services in the hope that it would provide another income stream other than traditional Xerox printing hardware. In theory, the buy made sense. More and more enterprises were turning to print and document management services to save money. The printing and copying business was also falling off as fewer people printed or copied documents. Services seemed like a good way to go. However, even by 2011, the place of the big, lumbering tech giants was already under question with HP also finally splitting into two entities in 2015. The market has responded well to Xerox so far, but has been less enthusiastic about Conduent. Its share price fell by 8 percent in initial trading and has regained little since then. Xerox over the coming months will focus on growing its digital print technology and services as well as offering customer’s new ways communicate, connect and work more productively. Conduent, for its part, has 96,000 employees globally and, based on pre-split earnings, revenues of $7 billion. It also automatically enters the Fortune 500 list, with a focus on business process services specializing in transaction-intensive processing, analytics and automation. If the lead up to the Xerox split was followed closely by both technology and financial analysts alike, the aftermath will also be watched to see what the eventual outcome will be. Alfresco, Formtex Build On Partnership Finally, this week, Concord, Calif.-based Formtek and Maiden Head, UK-based Alfresco have deepened their partnership with the release of 2.3 of the Version Browser for Alfresco 5.1.  The Formtek Version Browser is an extension to Alfresco One enterprise content management (ECM) system that enables easy visual comparisons of versioned documents. The biggest addition to this release of the Version Browser is the ability to do side-by-side version comparison. Version 2 of a document in the left view panel and Version 1 of the same document on the right. Using Version Bowers users will be able to view two different versions of a document, drawing or image side-by-side in most formats including Office documents, PDF and even AutoCAD file formats. The browser offers all other attributes needed for effective document management including versioning, undo and delete functions. It’s a small upgrade but a very useful one and makes document management across Alfresco One all that much easier.

CES, the world's largest annual consumer technology trade show, runs through January 13 and features more than 3,100 exhibitors showing off their latest products and services to about 140,000 attendees. (Photo : Ethan Miller/Getty Images) Watch out Apple Siri and Amazon Alexa rival, Google Assistant is now coming to Android-powered TVs. Google this week announced that its voice-activated AI tech Google Assistant will be coming to supported TVs and set-top boxes running Android TV in the next few months. The search giant has already named companies that will be getting the Google Assistant. According to CNET, the Mountain View-based company has just announced plans to bring its voice-activated Google Assistant to a few number of Android-powered TVs in coming months. This also means that owners of Android-powered TVs will soon be able to interact with their devices via voice commands using Google's digital assistant. However, there's some minimum requirement made, Google said the devices will need to run Android 6.0 Marshmallow or Android 7.0 Nougat versions of the operating system to receive the Google Assistant feature. Google Assistant Goes Mainstream Google's latest call for the Google Assistant to become available on all Android TVs in the U.S. in the coming months. Unfortunately, it didn't disclose when the Google Assistant will become available in other parts of the world. Google Assistant is similar to Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. It is designed to give users a way to interact with a wide range of mobile devices and other smart home devices. The Google Assistant integration will also allow owners of Android-powered TVs to do lots of things like browse for TV contents, search for TV shows, and even play content from Netflix and YouTube using only voice commands.In addition to the entertainment stuff, Android TV owners will also be able to do common tasks such as controlling the smart lighting system in their homes via Google Assistant voice commands. Google Assistant Coming to Nvidia Shield TV According to The Verge, the new Nvidia streaming box will be the first of all these devices to offer a hands-free Google Assistant experience. At CES 2017 event, Nvidia has introduced a new version of its Shield TV set-top box, and it is expanding its usefulness by integrating it with the Google Assistant. For Nvidia, the Google Assistant integration is the biggest change since it introduced the Android-powered gaming set-top box in early 2015. The move clearly shows that the company wants to position Nvidia Shield TV as a major set-top box for gamers in the gaming industry today. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang made the big announcement during the Nvidia CES 2017 keynote speech in Las Vegas. Google to Make Google Assistant Everywhere This is not the first time Google has integrated its AI tech with the devices. The search company has already integrated Google Assistant into its Google Allo smart messaging app. More recently into its Google Home voice-activated speaker, Google's own version of Amazon Echo. Google has been working hard, beefing up its AI capability. Last month, Google has decided to open up the development platform for Google Assistant to third party application developers.

These are predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which says that massive objects warp space-time around them. When these objects accelerate, they form gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time. Their presence was inferred in 1974, but none had been observed directly – until now. HUMANS: STALAGMITE CIRCLES In May, Neanderthals were credited with building a series of mysterious large stalagmite structures in a French cave. Roughly 175,000 years old, they are made from 400 individual stalagmites snapped from the cave floor and laid in a circle. No one knows why they were built or if they signified anything, although it has been suggested they served as some kind of shelter. TECHNOLOGY: AI BEATS HUMANS Lee Jin-man/AP images Advertisement An artificial intelligence made by Google subsidiary DeepMind can now beat humans at the ancient game of Go. AlphaGo took on Go grandmaster Lee Sedol in March and won a five game series 4-1. The victory sent shockwaves through both the AI and Go communities as both had thought the game was too difficult for an AI to perfect. HEALTH: END OF MENOPAUSE Menopause doesn’t have to be the end of fertility. In July, we reported on a team that claims to have found a way to rejuvenate post-menopausal ovaries, enabling them to release fertile eggs. The technique may boost declining fertility in older women, allow women with early menopause to become pregnant, and help stave off the detrimental health effects of menopause. TECHNOLOGY: GOOGLE AND THE NHS Google’s DeepMind has access to a wide range of healthcare data on the 1.6 million patients who attend three London hospitals run by the Royal Free NHS Trust each year, we discovered in April. The data-sharing agreement is so that DeepMind can build an app to help hospital staff monitor patients with kidney disease. But privacy campaigners raised questions about whether Google should have such access. EARTH: CO2‘S DEADLY SECRET In a year when plenty of climate records were broken, we uncovered the fact that the negative effects of a build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere have been underestimated. We asked researchers to plug the latest temperature data into their climate models and found that a given amount of CO2 led to higher temperatures than had previously been predicted. HEALTH: THREE-PARENT BABY A 5-month-old boy was the first baby to be born using a controversial technique that incorporates DNA from three people, we revealed in September. The method allows parents with rare genetic mutations to have healthy babies. The child’s Jordanian parents were treated by a US-based team in Mexico. Separately, in October, we discovered that the first babies made using a similar method to overcome infertility are due to be born in 2017. SPACE: MYSTERY PLANET NINE In January, two astronomers announced that a planet around 10 times the mass of Earth might be lurking in the outer reaches of our solar system, on an orbit that comes no closer than 200 times the distance between the sun and Earth. Planet Nine, as it was dubbed, hasn’t been seen directly, but its presence was inferred from the strange orbits of smaller bodies orbiting within the Kuiper belt. EARTH: SING WITH YOUR SUPPER Gorillas sing and hum when eating, a discovery that could help shed light on how language evolved in early humans, it emerged in February. Singing seems to be a way for gorillas to express contentment with their meal, as well as for the head of the family to communicate to others that it is dinner time. SPACE & PHYSICS: EARTH-LIKE PLANET ESO Hello neighbour. In August, an Earth-like planet was spotted just 4 light years away in our nearest star system. Proxima b orbits the star Proxima Centauri at a distance of 7.3 million kilometres – less than 5 per cent of the distance between Earth and the sun. Because the star is a small red dwarf, Proxima b sits in its habitable zone, which means the surface temperature may be right for it to host liquid water. EARTH: DO TREES SLEEP? Trees have been shown to undergo physical changes at night that can be likened to sleep, or at least to the day-night cycles seen in smaller plants. Branches of birch trees droop by as much as 10 centimetres at the tips towards the end of the night, it was reported in May. It isn’t known if the drooping is deliberate, dictated by an active sleep-night cycle, or passive, dictated by differences in the availability of water and light. HEALTH: NEW BLOOD FOR OLD Blood from human teenagers rejuvenates old mice, improving their memory, cognition and physical activity, it was reported in November. Old mice given blood plasma from 18-year-old volunteers were much better at remembering their way around a maze than untreated mice. The method could one day be used in people.

With this move, the payment coordination body of the European banking industry has placed over 34 European countries at the center-stage of ‘mobile payments’. This scheme will not only spearhead adoption of instant mobile payments and transactions worldwide, but also push the major economies of the World to start regulating the unstructured and incomplete mobile payments legal framework. The 2012 statement by the Associate General Counsel of Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (BGFRS), United States, summarized the consumer regulations related to mobile payments that are still existent and followed in the US. Growing adoption of mobile payments and steps taken by other regulatory bodies of the world like EPC will certainly push USA to update its own regulatory and legal framework. According to a report by market intelligence firm International Data Corporation, the worldwide annual transactions volume of mobile payments is expected to cross US$ 1 trillion in 2020 from US$ 500 billion in 2015. It becomes an equally valuable question – who is filling this huge gap? The answer is spread across companies ranging from global tech giants like Google etc. to fintech companies like Paypal and other several startups. The adoption rate of products and services enabling mobile payments has been moderate and hence, it tends to raise questions on market traction and penetration in days to come. As stated earlier, the legal framework and operative guidelines from the regulatory authorities on mobile based payments have been absent until now – not anymore! Companies like Samsung, Apple and Google have patiently waited for this opportunity and have been slowly gathering mobile payments related patents. As the regulatory and legal framework takes shape and markets incline towards reliance on mobile payments, something long due will be set in motion too – patent licensing and infringement lawsuits. Patent Landscape – Major Players The patent landscape of mobile based payments should help in putting things into perspective. Fintech companies are ruling the patent realm. Visa and Mastercard dominate with over 300 worldwide patented inventions each. PayPal is expanding its digital presence by investing huge in acquiring promising startups. In 2015 alone, it bought four startups including Xoom Corp., a digital money transfer company for US$ 890 million and Paydiant, a mobile wallet company for US$ 280 million. With such acquisitions and strategic partnership with Mastercard since 2007, PayPal is clearly one of the strongest mobile payments contender. Non-fintech companies are swiftly catching up too, owing to their strong smartphone market presence. Apple is placed at 13th position with respect to number of inventions but 2nd when it comes to the total number of patent publications (issued patents and pending publications). Samsung appears as the strongest competitor with 86 inventions and is placed ahead of all tech players. It acquired LoopPay, a mobile payments startup in 2015 for US$ 250 million and immediately rolled out tap-n-pay feature with its Galaxy S6. With this, Samsung is taking on potential market capturers like Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal-Mastercard partnership. Figure 2 shows the geographic interests of the top 15 players with respect to the number of total patent publications. Besides USA, Korea is the key geography with impressive patent portfolios built by players like Bizmodeline, Samsung, LG and SK Telecom. The bubble map (figure 3) shows comparative standings of these top 15 players with respect to their patent portfolios. The horizontal spread i.e. ‘patent quality’ has been prepared using our proprietary ‘patent quality scoring’ tool. The vertical spread i.e. ‘geographic expanse of filing’ refers to the stretch of jurisdictions in which inventions have been filed as patent applications. The size of a bubble corresponds to the number of inventions of that company related to mobile payments. Concur IP’s ‘Patent Quality Scoring’ tool benchmarks individual inventions against each other in a patent collection based on the following parameters: forward citations, geographic filing stretch, issuance status, remaining life and IPC (International Patent Classification) codes based technical expanse. Apple is a clear overall winner with a small yet powerful patent portfolio. Among the fintech companies, First Data Corp. has the portfolio with highest quality score followed by Visa and Paypal. This is mostly because First data’s portfolio is fairly younger and heavily cited by other parties. Bizmodeline is mostly concentrated in S. Korea with major focus only on contactless payments. Since, fintech companies lack the in-house smartphone support, market speculations of their acquisition by any of the smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung are imperative. Portfolios like Visa, Mastercard and Paypal are very lucrative for the surrounding companies. It isn’t too difficult to imagine how this bubble map would shape-up if any such acquisition happens. Payment Modes & Provisioning Let’s look at the enabling technologies and forms of mobile payments. Figure 4 shows the distribution of inventions among the payment modes and provisioning methods. Payment modes illustrate the underlying technologies used for mobile payments and provisioning refers to the payment tools. While most common payment modes use contactless techniques (such as NFC) and over-the-internet, SMS/ MMS/ USSD based transactions can be quite fast and handy. Payment modes which use interactive voice response (IVR) over a phone call and audio based are less popular, relatively non-intuitive and insecure. Audio based mode includes Near-Sound Transfer, Data-over-Voice, audio signature and acoustic coupling. Digital wallet based payments are most prolific both in prevalent products and patented inventions. A payment provisioning method can be implemented using several modes. For example, a wallet based payment can be made using any one of several modes, NFC being the most popular. Figure 5 illustrates the distribution of patented inventions for a) Payment Mode and b) Payment Provisioning among the top 15 assignees.  Security Solutions As mobile payments become mainstream and widespread, transactional security is vital. The four security technologies at the center-point of mobile payments are Tokenization, Secure Element, Trusted Execution Environment and Host Card Emulation. While these solutions take care of the infrastructural security, extra layers of security at different levels are needed to complement these solutions. Biometric provisions like Touch ID in Apple Pay, security PIN, one-time-passcode, point-to-point encryption, 3D secure are some of the popular ones. Let’s briefly discuss the top four technologies to better relate to the patenting trends of the top players among these candidates. Tokenization: Protecting sensitive financial information such as card number by replacing it with unique and virtual credentials called ‘tokens’. Visa leads with 355 patent publications (66 inventions) related to ‘tokenization’. Secure Element: A tamper-resistant chip or a SIM/ UICC card resident on the mobile phone that emulates a contactless card. Mastercard leads with 147 patent publications (35 inventions) related to ‘secure element’. Host Card Emulation (HCE): Unlike ‘secure element’, a payment card is emulated using either only software or cloud environment. Visa leads with 42 patent publications (4 inventions) related to HCE. Trusted Execution Environment (TEE): A secure portion of the mobile phone processor that offers end-to-end safe execution of ‘trusted’ applications by enforcing protection, confidentiality, integrity and data access rights. Visa leads with 42 patent publications (12 inventions) related to TEE. Conclusion According to a BCG report a whopping 3 billion users will rely on accessing internet-based services on mobile by 2020. This is a huge market and mobile based payments is undoubtedly the future of digital money transfer, commerce and banking. Looking at the distribution of technology and patents, the power lies mostly divided between fintech and non-fintech companies. Hence, mergers and acquisitions will become more prominent in times to come and so will patent infringement lawsuits. When chip giant Qualcomm announced to acquire NFC pioneer NXP Semiconductors for US$ 47 billion earlier in 2016, it clearly indicated that Qualcomm has strong intentions to catapult its way into mobile payments, apart from Internet-of-Things and connected devices. Mobile based payment is complex business area and is still evolving. To offer comprehensive services in compliance with the upcoming regulatory guidelines and security benchmarks, it will become almost impossible for a company X offering a service, for example mobile wallet,  to bypass using a security solution like ‘tokenization’ patented by company Y. A 2016 Bloomberg report highlights the seriousness with which fintech companies are taking their patent portfolio and how they intend to compete with the tech giants in asserting their IP. Since, mobile phone manufacturers are the front-end contenders, it gives them even stronger reason to assess the technology, competitive standings and patent landscape of mobile payments. Building a streamlined patent portfolio by identifying technology trends and filling the corresponding gaps can prove crucial. It will not only enable the phone makers to offer more robust mobile payment services but also prepare for the upcoming patent wars.

It takes more than just a great piece of content to get results. One key component of an effective content marketing plan involves pitching content to get more exposure and building authoritative links from relevant sites. Without a proper plan in place to get your content the right kind of exposure, you risk it being useless.   In a previous article, I’ve written a rudimentary level piece that serves as a tactical guide for B2B companies to getting content picked up by industry journals. Assuming that you have a deeper knowledge of SEO and content marketing, we’ll dive into how to pitch your content for more exposure. Recommended tools for your link building plan Whether you’re pitching your piece to one editor or 50, you should have a set of reliable tools to ease your link building process. Here are a few industry favorites. BuzzStream BuzzStream is a link building and digital PR tool that is great for link management. Using the Chrome Extension BuzzMarker, you can easily add contacts to your lists on BuzzStream directly from the site you’re on. If you’re pitching multiple pieces for several projects, this is a great way to keep track of emails going in and out. You can also track when / if an email is opened and whether a link within an email was clicked on. HARO HARO provides journalists (and marketers) a database of sources for upcoming stories. Which means ample opportunity for you to pitch your content and get it more exposure. You can subscribe to receive emails 3x a day for topics that you’re interested in such as “Business and finance” and “high tech.” This free tool allows you to pitch your idea to media outlets like the New York Times, Mashable, Bloomberg Business week, TIME and countless others. As Brian Dean from Backlinko stated, “HARO (short for Help a Reporter Out) is one of best ways to get killer backlinks from authority news sites.” Majestic Majestic is a link intelligence tool for SEO and internet PR and marketing. Their unique URLS crawled is at 237.2 billion – which means more data for you. Use the Majestic Backlink Analyzer when you’re on a site to quickly check the strength of any page. The Backlink History tool is a great way to compare backlinks and learn more.   MozBar MozBar is another Chrome extension that lets you analyze link metrics and gives you access to important SEO metrics from a glance as you make your way through SERPs. Use this tool to help you choose which sites you should pitch your content to. Google Advanced Search Operators To save time in searching for relevant publications, use Google’s Advanced Search Operators to avoid aimlessly searching through countless Google SERPs. Google’s guide includes a comprehensive list of search operators that will help you narrow down exactly what you’re looking for in your search. Here are a few helpful search operators for prospecting: Intitle: The “intitle:” search operator is a title specific search that will only show results that have that exact query in the title. Inurl: The “inurl:” search operator is a URL specific search that will only show results that have that exact query in the URL. Site: The “site:” search operator is a site specific search that will show you only pages within a specific site. Related: The “related:” search operator will show you results related to your query. You can use this search operator to find sites related to great publications you’ve already found. Once you’ve gathered a list of publications, use this search operator on each one you’ve found to make sure you haven’t missed any. 6. Other tools Let’s say you’ve found a great site to pitch your content to and you want to find similar ones. Here are a few other tools to help:   Download the Similar Sites Add-on from Chrome. When on a site that you’ve found relevant, use this extension to show sites that are similar to the one you’re on. As with any tool, it’s not perfect. You should look into each publication that it recommends before adding to your final list. Be cautious as some of the sites they recommend may not be good choices.   Use Similar Site Search to find other related sites. Again, be cautious as some of their suggestions may be irrelevant. Keep in mind that you’re limited to a certain number of searches per day. Steps to pitching your content Do your research This is one of the most critical stages for getting your content picked up. Take the time to actually research what the publication is about so that:  You get high-quality, industry-relevant publications that you can get authoritative backlinks from. When pitching to the editor, you’ll be able to customize and make the pitch more personal. As in, your pitch will be authentic It won’t look like you’re pitching content to a site that covers nothing about that subject matter. Know the publication’s target audience The best starting place is usually the “About us” section. You can find a summary of who the publication’s audience is, what type of content they publish, whether or not they will accept content, etc. This section can save you a lot of time, especially if it states right in the summary that they don’t accept guest blogs. Read previous content on the site After reading through the “About us” section of the site, you should read through the actual content on their site. This will give you a better idea of the topics they cover and whether or not they will be willing to publish your content. Keep these articles in mind because they make great talking points in the email pitches that you’ll write later on. Once you’ve read enough to get a basic understanding of what they like to publish, decide whether or not your content would make sense on their site. Pro tip: Use the “site: search operator” to find if the publication has written about your topic in the past. Find a place for your article to live When reading through the site, pay attention to the sections that you’re reading. Ask yourself, does it make sense for your content to be published in this section? Once you’ve found a place, make a note to mention where you’d like your piece to live in your email pitch. Know your point of contact The best point of contact is the editor/editor-in-chief of the publication. If you can’t find the editor’s contact information, look for a managing editor or whoever would be the person who works most closely with the editor. Next, find out more about the editor. You want your email to sound as authentic and personable as possible. Research them by doing a quick Google search. Are they on LinkedIn? Twitter? Did they Tweet something that you found interesting and you’d like to mention it in your email? Keep in mind that editors receive hundreds of emails a week with people pitching their content. You want to do your best to stand out. Pitching your content Introduce yourself: The first step to the opening of any email is to introduce yourself. Let the reader know who you are and who you’re working with. Keep it conversational: Stick with colloquial language and avoid sounding too formal. This may depend on your audience, but in most cases it’s better to speak less formal. Provide something of value: Your pitch should explain why your piece of content will provide value to the publication. Answer these questions in your pitch: how will this piece benefit their audience? Why should they pick this piece up? Be authentic in your reasoning of why it’s important and go into detail. End with a question: Always end with a question. This is your version of a call to action. Make sure to ask a specific question like, “Would you be interested in publishing this article in the industry news section of your site?” Attention grabbing subject line: Sometimes the most difficult part of a pitch is writing a subject line. It’s definitely one of the most important parts to your email because it’s the first thing your contact will see in their inbox. It’s important to write an attention grabbing subject line that will make the reader want to open your email. You can read this article for some tips to improve your email marketing subject lines.   Keep it brief: If you’re pitching to an editor, they’re probably bombarded with hundreds of emails a week. Keep your email as short as you can and get to your point as quickly as possible. Read on how to email busy people to help get your email opened. Follow up: If your contact hasn’t responded yet, it may be because they meant to go back to it later or it somehow slipped through the cracks. You should follow up with those who didn’t respond to your email about two days later. Give them a quick refresher of what you’re pitching and the value it will bring to their audience. Keep this follow up even shorter than your original post.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot January 16, 2017 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Five most interesting search marketing news stories of the week Industry Local More News Social 06 Jan 17 | Rebecca Sentance Facebook0 Linkedin51 Google+11 Twitter 62 Welcome to our weekly round-up of all the latest news and research from the world of search marketing and beyond. And a happy 2017 to all of our Search Engine Watch readers! This week, we’ve got a health-conscious New Year’s update from Bing, a new AI-powered search engine which is transforming scientific research, and a look at why the fake information epidemic could be damaging to local search. A new AI powered search engine is changing how neuroscientists do research Google’s work in the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning has succeeded in making web search more intuitive, effective and useful than it’s ever been before. But until now, the same couldn’t be said of scientific research. That’s all changing with the development of a new, free search engine, Semantic Scholar. Adam Stetzer wrote for Search Engine Watch this week about how the AI-powered search engine is changing the way that neuroscientists do research, using data mining and natural language processing to truly understand the links between research – and what this means for similar search options like Google Scholar. How Instagram became a powerhouse for social commerce 2016 was a busy year for Instagram, with more users, more brands, and a host of new improvements and features all joining the platform. In November, Instagram tested out a new shopping feature in a bid to woo ecommerce brands and give users a way to shop more visually. This week, on Search Engine Watch’s sister site ClickZ, Tereza Litsa spoke to Olapic’s Paul Sabria about the steps that Instagram has taken to turn itself into a social commerce powerhouse, and what we can expect from the platform in 2017. Bing rolls out health-conscious search updates in time for New Year’s resolutions Bing has rolled out a health-focused update to its search platform just in time for everyone to turn over a leaf in the New Year. In late November, we saw that Bing had launched a carousel of shopping flyers to promote deals in time for Black Friday. Now whenever you search for “workouts” or “exercises” on Bing, it will deliver a carousel of images which link to a wide variety of exercise options. Users who search for information on yoga and pilates will also be rewarded with a carousel, and occasionally a how-to video on a specific pose at the top of search. Meanwhile, the Bing app has new updates aimed at making the food search experience “even richer”, including information on calorie counts and low-fat recipes. Image: Bing blogs Bing’s new updates are obviously aimed at providing more intuitive, quick answers to users’ search queries in the same way that Google already does with Quick Answers and featured snippets. While they might be on a smaller scale, the tie-in with different times of year such as Black Friday and New Year is a fun way to introduce these features and draw users’ attention to them through the things they are most likely to be searching for.

Which Google algorithm changes impacted marketers most in 2016 - and what can we expect from 2017? 10 online marketing strategies to make you a unicorn [infographic] How the fake information epidemic will hurt local search in 2017 Headlines about the online fake news epidemic have been everywhere since the US Election, particularly if you follow news about publishing or social media. But Wesley Young, Vice President of Public Affairs for the Local Search Association, believes that this problem is set to get worse in 2017 – and that it will be damaging to local search in particular. In a column for Search Engine Land, Young laid out how the issue of fake news and information can hurt marketers, along with eight ways that false information is currently being used which marketers should be aware of. “As consumers search for information to help make purchase decisions, uncertainty about the veracity of the information they receive impacts the effectiveness of local search marketing. Online advertising already faces challenges gaining consumer trust, and the proliferation of fake content will only hurt it more. Worse, you may be spending money on advertising that no one ever sees, be competing in an unfair market, suffer from hits to your reputation or pay more than you should for marketing products or services. Being aware of how false information is being used will help marketers avoid problems and identify when they may be affected, saving them from both headaches and wasted dollars.” Google clarifies details of its mobile interstitials penalty As part of Google’s ongoing efforts to improve the experience of browsing the mobile web, a penalty for sites which use annoying mobile interstitials – pop-ups which appear while a website is loading and cover the entire page – is due to take effect next week, beginning on 10th January. The question of what kind of interstitials, exactly, will incur penalties has been the subject of considerable discussion amongst the SEO community. This week, Google provided some further clarification on the issue in the form of a tweet from Webmaster Trends Analyst John Wu. He was responding to a query from Kristine Schachinger, technical SEO expert and founder of digital marketing agency The Vetters, about whether the penalty will only affect interstitials which appear when users are navigating from the search results page to a mobile site, or whether it will include interstitials which appear when navigating between pages of the same website. @schachin @methode yes — John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) January 4, 2017 Schachinger further enquired as to whether the penalty would affect interstitials which appear between an AMP page and a regular site page, to which Mu replied, “I haven’t seen an interstitial there, but that would be seen the same as site-page -> site-page.” Want to stay on top of the latest search trends?Get top insights and news from our search experts.

It’s a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. So what exactly is being collected, stored or shared ? To work, the Echo is always listening. Once it hears someone utter a keyword, such as “Alexa,” it shares what it hears with Amazon’s servers to process a response. Those conversations are then stored indefinitely. Google’s Home speaker works in a similar fashion. The Echo “has to listen to everything. That’s kind of disturbing,” said Ryan O’Leary, vice-president of WhiteHat Security’s threat research centre. “It doesn’t capture voice until it hears the keyword, but it could. You’re trusting the devices to not do that, but it’s entirely possible.” In the Arkansas case, authorities investigating the death of a man found floating face-up in a hot tub at a friend’s home requested the contents of the home’s Echo and Amazon’s stored recordings in hopes they might contain evidence. The friend is charged with murder. A judge has signed off on the search, but Amazon has balked. Amazon has declined to comment specifically on the case but said the company objects to “overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.” Some experts worry that allowing such a search would erode people’s privacy. “It’s not necessarily a direct threat for the average person, but the same thing can be said with any kind of privacy concern,” O’Leary said. “People say you shouldn’t be concerned if you’re not doing anything wrong, but that’s a dangerous precedent to set.” Meanwhile, companies keep asking consumers to invite them into their homes. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its smart-home appliances, including a washing machine, a stove and a refrigerator. Someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as the Echo. Simplehuman has a voice-activated trash can, and GE Lighting has a table lamp using Alexa voice control. For now, voice control is mainly an add-on feature rather than a core component of gadgets. It’s there for those who want to use it, but it’s not essential for the product to function. Many manufacturers are opting to use Amazon’s Alexa service for now, though some are embracing voice systems from Google, Apple or Samsung. Nvidia’s Shield TV streaming device, for instance, employs Google’s Assistant service so viewers can control video playback or find out the weather with just a voice command. Meanwhile, Samsung’s new Family Hub lets people use their voice to add items to shopping lists and order groceries online. CES chief economist Shawn DuBravac said as many as 700 companies could announce Alexa-integrated products during the gadget show, on top of more than 1,500 existing ones. As the smart home becomes more entrenched, DuBravac said, voice control could change the way we interact with technology in much the way the mouse did in the 1980s. “Connected microphones are starting to appear in everything from cars to children’s toys,” said James Plouffe, lead solutions architect at mobile-security company MobileIron. “Consumers should think carefully about how comfortable they are with the prospect of a live mic in common household items.” Because Amazon says it uses information gathered by the Echo to improve its voice technology, that information has the potential to “live forever” online, Plouffe said. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Derrick Dicol, executive director of Comcast’s Xfinity home, which uses voice controls in its home automation products, noted that people had to get used to sharing their banking information online. “This is less invasive than that,” he said. “It’s just a different thing people have to feel comfortable with.”     Videos Call of Duty's John Marshall Jones On The Wonders Of Motion Capture Raw: Deadly Train Crash in Egypt A Houston Mom Found Security Footage Of Her Daughters' Bedroom Online Deep-Space Exploration Requires Habitats, And NASA's On It Prepared For Takeoff: Amazon Launches Its First Branded Cargo Plane Samsung Galaxy Note 7 comes with iris scanner Anton Yelchin's Parents -- Sues Chrysler ...

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Jan 6, 2017 at 9:14AM For the past few years, home automation -- the so-called smart home -- has been coming, but in 2017 it might be time to say it's here. Products like Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo/Alexa and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home, along with Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone/Siri, have become viable platforms to control smart homes. And while only Amazon and Google have an official presence at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), smart-home devices that work with one or more of those platforms (as well as others) were one of the dominant trends at the show. In fact, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which puts on the show, released a new report on the eve of CES saying that smart homes would be the "most popular means of Internet of Things engagement." CTA also predicted sales of 29 million units in 2017, a 63% percent increase over 2016. To make that happen, companies need to deliver devices that meet consumer needs. A new survey from Coldwell Banker Real Estate and Vivint Smart Homes found that there is one feature that a majority of Americans want on their smart-home devices: voice control. Smart home devices were everywhere at CES 2017. Image source: author. What does the survey say? The report showed that more than 7 in 10 (72%) Americans who already have smart-home products controlled remotely by a smartphone, tablet, computer, or separate automatic system within the home itself want voice control. But, only 48% of people who have smart-home devices, the report found, already have voice control capability. "We're not surprised that so many Americans want to be able to use their voice to control smart home products because it makes for a much more intuitive user experience," said Coldwell Banker Chief Marketing Officer Sean Blankenship. " ... we're hearing directly from our agents that their clients are demanding voice control to make their smart home experience more seamless." Parents want voice control, according to the research, and nearly 4 in 5 (79%) of Generation X members have smart-home products but want voice control. That's followed by millennials at 74%, and baby boomers at 63%. "Last year we announced our integration with Amazon Echo and we've been blown away with how consumers are unlocking the full potential of a voice-controlled smart home," said Vivint CMO Jeff Lyman. "By simply saying aloud what they want to happen with their locks, lights, thermostats and security system, customers spend more time living and less time managing. The experience is pretty magical." What are Americans using voice control for? When it comes to people who have smart homes with voice control and people who want smart homes with voice control, the top use in both cases is entertainment. That was the top use for the former at 57% and the latter at 43%. In both cases, controlling smart lighting was the second choice. Image source: Coldwell Banker/Vivint. Why is voice control important? Most Americans believe that voice control will give them a more intuitive user experience, according to the Coldwell Banker/Vivint report, which was produced by surveying 4,108 U.S. adults ages 18 and older, among whom 923 have any smart home products. "The most commonly cited benefits for using voice control among respondents were hands-free control at 30%, increased user-friendliness at 17% and flexibility in location at 14%," read the study. Part of the reason Americans want voice control in their smart-home devices is because they are already comfortable with the technology. Of the people surveyed who already have smart-home products, 74% of them said they use voice control on their smartphones. This is what's coming While Siri has stumbled at least partly because Apple launched it without tightly limiting its parameters and Google's Assistant has yet to make much of a mark, Amazon Echo shows that people will use voice control at home. Going from asking a digital assistant to tell you the weather or playing a song to having one actually control your home will take some time. Amazon has taken a smart approach by slowly adding functionality and opening up its Echo/Alexa platform to outside developers. That has given the company a foothold in people's houses that might allow it to expand its presence. Apple, Google, and maybe even a few others have a chance to work their way in as well (and a quick look around at CES shows that dozens, maybe hundreds are trying to get involved in some fashion), but it's very clear that whatever products people select, voice control will have to be a key component.

Last week, Facebook unveiled a tool called “style transfer” that applies visual effects to live phone video in real time. Making your clips look like an episode of The Simpsons or a Van Gogh painting may seem gimmicky, but the artificial intelligence required to do this would usually need to run on massive servers. Google squeezed a neural network into its Google Translate app last year. Now, Facebook has developed a deep learning system called Caffe2Go that is condensed enough to run directly in mobile apps on iOS and Android. The style transfer technique will be the first opportunity for users to try it out. Event: Instant Expert: Artificial Intelligence New Scientist spoke to Facebook’s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, about the company’s work in AI and how it will affect the way we communicate, from the existing Facebook newsfeed to the future of virtual reality and increasing global connectivity. Advertisement How do you make a neural network that’s efficient enough to run on a mobile device? If you think of this neural net as a sequence of steps, where you’re processing information at each step and feeding it to the next one, then one of the goals from the algorithmic standpoint is to reduce that to the smallest number of steps yet get the same results. So, basically, the algorithmic challenge is building smaller models that produce very similar results. And then the second part is lots of optimisation specific to working on mobile devices. Even if you have one of these small neural net models, if you take it and naively implement it on a mobile phone, it just won’t work. So we had a really interesting pairing of the scientists, who were trying to figure out how to do model compression, combined with people who are really good at chip-level optimisation, who were trying lots of different techniques to optimise each of the parts to make it run very quickly on the phone. Changing videos to make them more artistic is fun, but what else could we use it for? One of the reasons we focused on this, although it seems like just a fun, slightly silly application, is that when you’re creating something, the delay could turn something that would otherwise be fun into something arduous. That time delay is the difference between fun, creative spontaneity and not doing it, basically. But there are other things. We have demos running where you can combine this application with object detection, so if you want to apply different effects to the foreground and background of the video, you could do that. What else is Facebook training neural net technology to do? It’s doing all sorts of different things. We’re using it for translations. We’re using it to automatically generate captions for the billions of images uploaded every day, so if you have a visual disability and want to have a photo effectively read to you, you can have that happen. We’re using it to help improve newsfeed ranking: of the thousands of possible stories you can see, you’re going to read only 10 or 20 or 30, and we’re going to show you the best possible ones. We use it for spam detection, so if people are trying to share things on Facebook that don’t belong, we can detect it and eliminate it. You’ve previously talked about the role of virtual reality in future social interactions. How is Facebook’s AI going to help? AI is a key technology to make VR work. Figuring out where your head and hands are in the real world and mapping them into the VR world is a computer vision and VR problem. Without that, the system just doesn’t work. You couldn’t easily have done this 10 or 20 years ago the way you can today. Think about the further problem of how we bring realistic avatars into the VR world. If someone’s laughing while I’m in VR with them, we can detect that and make sure the avatar looks like it’s laughing. And as the person is speaking, we’re actually analysing the phonemes and animating the mouth of their avatar so it looks realistic, like the individual is speaking rather than just having the avatar sitting there not moving its mouth. You’re not going to feel a sense of presence with that person if their avatar is just stony-faced all the time. In the long run, think about all these systems out there that are building intelligent agents, whether they are messenger bots or things you can speak to in the home. VR will be a natural environment for that too because you could have something that could help you navigate the mass of the virtual world. You could say, “Hey, take me to Mars,” or “Take me to see my friend Joe,” and the virtual agent could help you navigate rather than clicking menus or moving buttons around. It would be a natural place for a virtual assistant, but that’s probably in the more distant future. What would it take to develop that? I think speech recognition is a generally well-solved problem in artificial intelligence and is working really well, but a harder challenge in AI that people are also making progress on is natural language understanding: disambiguating what people are saying. When I say, “Take me to Mars,” what does that mean? Is this a specific game? Is it a trailer for The Martian? What am I referring to? That is a challenging problem in AI. When these systems work and they give you exactly what you want, it’s awesome and magical. But when they give you the wrong answer, it’s really frustrating. So you want to build systems that work more often than not, otherwise people won’t use them. That’s one of the problems with AI: building systems that understand language in the way humans do. What’s your vision for when we’ve all got neural nets in our pockets? The one resource that people can’t get back is time. The days pass and the time goes, and you can’t get it back. I think where AI can really help us is by focusing our time on the things we care about. I could spend the time learning three more languages so I can communicate with family members, or if I have a system that can automatically translate, I can spend that time with those family members instead, or I can spend that time creating music or pursuing hobbies or doing work, whatever it may be. That’s my hope: that people waste no time on things that are unimportant because we have systems watching out for us and making sure we’re focused on the things we most care about.

John Herrington, senior vice-president of Samsung Electronics America, unveils new refrigerators with Family Hub 2.0 during a Samsung news conference before CES International in Las Vegas, Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017. (AP / John Locher) Bree Fowler and Mae Anderson, The Associated Press Published Friday, January 6, 2017 9:34AM EST LAS VEGAS -- Alexa, are you spying on me? It's a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. So what exactly is being collected, stored or shared ? To work, the Echo is always listening. Once it hears someone utter a keyword, such as "Alexa," it shares what it hears with Amazon's servers to process a response. Those conversations are then stored indefinitely. Google's Home speaker works in a similar fashion. The Echo "has to listen to everything. That's kind of disturbing," said Ryan O'Leary, vice president of WhiteHat Security's threat research centre. "It doesn't capture voice until it hears the keyword, but it could. You're trusting the devices to not do that, but it's entirely possible." In the Arkansas case, authorities investigating the death of a man found floating face-up in a hot tub at a friend's home requested the contents of the home's Echo and Amazon's stored recordings in hopes they might contain evidence. The friend is charged with murder. A judge has signed off on the search, but Amazon has balked. Amazon has declined to comment specifically on the case but said the company objects to "overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course." Some experts worry that allowing such a search would erode people's privacy. "It's not necessarily a direct threat for the average person, but the same thing can be said with any kind of privacy concern," O'Leary said. "People say you shouldn't be concerned if you're not doing anything wrong, but that's a dangerous precedent to set." Meanwhile, companies keep asking consumers to invite them into their homes. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its smart-home appliances, including a washing machine, a stove and a refrigerator. Someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as the Echo. Simplehuman has a voice-activated trash can, and GE Lighting has a table lamp using Alexa voice control. For now, voice control is mainly an add-on feature rather than a core component of gadgets. It's there for those who want to use it, but it's not essential for the product to function. Many manufacturers are opting to use Amazon's Alexa service for now, though some are embracing voice systems from Google, Apple or Samsung. Nvidia's Shield TV streaming device, for instance, employs Google's Assistant service so viewers can control video playback or find out the weather with just a voice command. Meanwhile, Samsung's new Family Hub lets people use their voice to add items to shopping lists and order groceries online. CES chief economist Shawn DuBravac said as many as 700 companies could announce Alexa-integrated products during the gadget show, on top of more than 1,500 existing ones. As the smart home becomes more entrenched, DuBravac said, voice control could change the way we interact with technology in much the way the mouse did in the 1980s. "Connected microphones are starting to appear in everything from cars to children's toys," said James Plouffe, lead solutions architect at mobile-security company MobileIron. "Consumers should think carefully about how comfortable they are with the prospect of a live mic in common household items." Because Amazon says it uses information gathered by the Echo to improve its voice technology, that information has the potential to "live forever" online, Plouffe said. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Derrick Dicol, executive director of Comcast's Xfinity home, which uses voice controls in its home automation products, noted that people had to get used to sharing their banking information online. "This is less invasive than that," he said. "It's just a different thing people have to feel comfortable with."
