 Google wants to take back control of Android David Gilbert, VICE News Sep. 21, 2016, 7:23 PM 4,326 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Images Google has always been a reluctant hardware maker, even though its Android operating system powers more than 80 percent of smartphones around the globe. But next month it plans to launch two new "Made by Google" smartphones running a unique version of Android with new features unavailable on any other phone. Google's hope is that by producing unique phones — and selling lots of them — it can take back control of Android, which is used freely by smartphone manufacturers from Samsung to Huawei which barely mention Android and are increasingly adding their own apps and services on top to stand out, and diluting Google's vision of Android in the process. With reports suggesting Huawei is secretly preparing its own operating system as a possible replacement for Android, and Samsung openly developing its Tizen operating system, Google knows it needs to change the way Android works, and for now it appears that making its own smartphones with unique software features is how it want to do this. A teaser video released by Google gives little away about what it will launch on October 4 beyond the fact that it will be a rectangle, but widespread leaks and reports suggest the search giant will introduce two new smartphones, ditching the Nexus branding in favour of the "Pixel" name. While Taiwanese electronics firm HTC is expected to manufacture new smartphones, according to the official website for the October 4 event, the new devices will be branded as "Made by Google."  Google typically launches its new smartphones with the latest update to Android, which this year is called Nougat and which was released with little fanfare on older devices last month. This year however reports suggest the company is looking to add new features to the software which will be exclusive to its Pixel smartphones. These reports are given added weight by Google CEO Sundar Pichai's comments earlier this year, saying the company would be "more opinionated about the design of the phones," and would "add more features on top of Android on Nexus phones." While the latest version of Android is as good as, if not better than, Apple's iOS 10, the problem is that very few of the Android smartphones in use today will ever get to take advantage of its new features. The figures speak for themselves. Just 15 percent of active Android smartphones and tablets are currently using Android 6.0, which was released in October last year. In comparison, Apple's iOS 9 which was released just one month earlier, is being used by 88 percent of iPhone and iPad users according to Apple's most recent figures.

Next week marks the grand opening of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC). A museum 100 years in the making, the NMAAHC is much more than just a collection of artifacts. Within its walls, visitors will take part in an immersive journey into the important contributions of African Americans in the United States. It’s a mosaic of stories – stories from our history that are core to who we are as a nation. And we’re proud to help bring these stories to life with a first-of-its-kind 3D interactive exhibit and a $1 million grant from Google.org, part of our ongoing work on racial and social justice issues. A new way to explore artifacts A few years ago, Dr. Lonnie Bunch, the NMAAHC’s director, came to Google’s headquarters and shared his vision to make the museum the most technologically advanced in the world. I immediately knew I wanted to be involved, and pulled together people from across the company: designers who focus on user interaction, members of the Cultural Institute, engineers who work on everything from Google Maps to YouTube, and members of the Black Googler Network. For the past year, we’ve been working to deliver on Dr. Bunch’s vision. Our team quickly learned that museums are often only able to showcase a fraction of their content and archives to visitors. So we asked ourselves: what technology do we have at Google that could help enrich the museum experience? We worked closely with the museum to build an interactive exhibit to house artifacts from decades of African American history and let visitors explore and learn about them. With 3D scanning, 360 video, multiple screens and other technologies, visitors can see artifacts like a powder horn or handmade dish from all angles by rotating them with a mobile device. The interactive exhibit will open in spring 2017. Taking an Expedition through African American history In addition to the interactive exhibit, we’re also launching two new Google Expeditions that take students on a digital journey through African American history. Earlier this year, we formed the African American Expeditions Council – a group of top minds in Black culture, academia and curation – to help develop Expeditions that tell the story of Africans in America. With participation from the National Park Service, the Expeditions team captured images of the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, which commemorates the events, people and route of the 1965 Voting Rights March. A second Expedition, from the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, takes you around Dr. King’s childhood home and the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he preached. Discovering and sharing new stories At the end of this week, we’re celebrating the opening of the NMAAHC during one of the most important weeks for African Americans in D.C., the week of the Congressional Black Caucus Annual Legislative Conference (ALC). On Friday night of ALC, we’ll salute NMAAHC Founding Director, Dr. Bunch, and the Congressional Black Caucus. The iconic Congressman John Lewis, an Honorary Member of our African American Expeditions Council, will be on hand to talk about the impact of Expeditions in telling the story that the NMAAHC will bring to life in so many important ways. Day to day, I work on Google Maps, where we help people around the world find and discover new places. Working on this exhibit has given me a chance to help people discover something else – the ways African American history is vitally intertwined with our history as a nation. I’m proud of the role Google has played a role in taking people on that journey.

St. Paul-based McNally Smith College of Music on Thursday said it will move its students and faculty to Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendar and several other of the tech company’s Internet services. This is largely an economizing maneuver aimed at “relieving our IT department of the traditional costs associated with e-mail and collaboration solutions,” college President Harry Chalmiers said in a statement. Related Articles Wondering what to get your favorite Apple fanatic for the holiday? Wolverton: Google Home, Amazon Echo mix convenience with creepiness Dow reaches record highs, tech stocks slump Trump tax plan could solve huge Silicon Valley problem In search for missing Woodbury man, local company offered its drone The college also is buying into the online-based nature of Google’s services — often collectively called Google Apps — which will give students anytime, anywhere access to their school files and personal information while also permitting them to collaborate and communicate on any Internet-connected device. McNally Smith’s use of the Google services is set to begin during this fall semester. “We’re glad to let Google do what it does best — provide us with innovative technology, so we can do what we do best — provide our students with the best music education possible,” Chalmiers said. It is a familiar refrain. Numerous other Minnesota-based colleges and Universities have “gone Google” to varying degrees, which gives the Silicon Valley tech giant a powerful role in the state’s higher-education sphere. Carleton College in Northfield switched to Google Calendar and Gmail this summer. The University of Minnesota has deployed Google to all students and staffers — and even its alumni. The Minnesota College of Art and Design has been using Google services since 2010. Other institutions using Google services include St. Paul’s Bethel University, Hamline University, Macalester College and St. Catherine University, along with Concordia College in Moorhead, Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter and St. Mary’s University in Winona. Concordia and Macalester are a Google veteran, having used these services since 2007 and 2008, respectively. WHAT GOOGLE GETS Colleges don’t pay for these services, which also are advertising-free, but they help Google in nudging many of its campus users to its consumer-focused and ad-centric services. What’s more, Google users in higher education are more likely to harness the services in the workplace, where Google also boasts a powerful position. Google by no means has a monopoly in Minnesota higher education. The sibling schools of St. John’s University in Collegeville and the College of St. Benedict in St. Joseph have instead embraced Microsoft services. St. John’s athletic archrival, St. Paul’s University of St. Thomas, followed suit this summer when it went with Microsoft instead of Google services. But Google has an increasingly dominant role in U.S. education if K-12 schools are factored in. Its Web-centric Chromebook laptops have outsold Apple’s iPads in schools lately. Chromebook users in the classroom are by default Google-service users. For Google, this often means an unbroken path from K-12 schools to college campuses to companies of all sizes, cementing its role as productivity-service giant. Google’s services are also prevalent in the government and nonprofit spheres. WHAT CRITICS SAY Not everyone is happy about this. Some are uncomfortable with an over-reliance on the company’s services. “By getting Google products in the hands of users before they can read, Google is building a giant base of people who will likely be life-long users of its products,” college educator Jackie Smith and Internet activist Alfredo Lopez said in an essay on the left-leaning political site CounterPunch. “By spoon feeding young people on easy-to-use applications, they will become addicted to Google,” the authors went on.” They may not even become aware that there are alternatives, since all of their classmates, friends, and teachers use Google.” Smith and Lopez also have numerous privacy concerns given the company’s ability to scan user data and its close ties to the U.S. government. A number of schools, including Harvard University and University of California-Berkeley, have recently sued Google, citing what they claim is illegal scanning of campus Gmail accounts potentially for advertising purposes. COLLEGES LOVE GOOGLE But Google has largely happy higher-ed customers in Minnesota. St. Mary’s University, for example, is all-in with the Google tools. “We have a ‘ninja’ training program available for faculty and staff to participate in to help them learn and use these tools (Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Drive),” said Stacia Vogel, assistant vice president for marketing and communications. At Concordia, Google services have “been especially beneficial to our university during (a) time of university growth as we have not had to concern ourselves with licensing issues, size limitations on locally hosted servers and the like,” said Jonathan Breitbarth, director of computer services. Concordia’s shift from a university that long issued students’ computers to, in 2014, one that allowed students to bring their own computers was made easier with Google’s online-based services, Breitbarth added. Still, some Google-subscribed institutions are proceeding cautiously. At Gustavus Adolphus, traditional e-mail servers will keep running for the foreseeable future even as Gmail is widely deployed. “We’re pretty late to the party as far as Gmail adoption goes, but with something as ubiquitous as email, we wanted to make sure we were considering all of our options,” said Jerry Nowell, director of Web services. MICROSOFT CAN COMPETE Gustavus isn’t all-Google, either. It largely uses Microsoft’s Office 365 productivity suite for document creation and file sharing, said J.J. Akin, director of media services. “Our primary focus is Google, (but) the Office 365 suite provides a good alternative for people who are more comfortable with Microsoft products and/or want experience using them,” Akin said. Meanwhile, at St. John’s and St. Ben’s, students and faculty have happily gone all-Microsoft. The Redmond, Wash.-based software company, once focused on desktop applications, “now offers Web apps, too,” said Casey Gordon, director of information technology services for both institutions. “Google once had a massive edge because of their Google Apps, but with Microsoft’s online apps, that’s no longer the (case),” she said. “Microsoft’s offerings are more competitive now.” Contract negotiations with Google raised certain privacy concerns, Gordon added, and the company “would not adjust their language on privacy … This is concerning.” Tags:  Education,  Technology Julio Ojeda-Zapata Julio Ojeda-Zapata covers technology for the Pioneer Press’ business and features desks.

Previously, the company had claimed end-to-end encryption for messages, but later it was revealed that it would only work for incognito chats. Now, as it turns out, all the messages sent in non-incognito mode will indefinitely be stored on Google's servers until you manually delete them. This is seemingly done to improve Allo's Assistant feature, that provides responses to what you type. Having a previous chat history improves the machine learning experience, allowing the Assistant to provide better suggestions but this comes at the obvious cost of privacy. The Assistant is also the reason why regular chats aren't end to end encrypted, as it needs access to the messages, something it cannot do in incognito mode where the messages are encrypted. There are legal ramifications to this as well, as law enforcements can now demand to see these messages and being non-secure can easily be handed over by Google. Bottomline is, if you want to use all the features of Allo, know that it is not secure. If you want something secure, use Signal or WhatsApp that have forced end to end encryption on all chats and don't store information on their servers.

Google open sources image captioning model in TensorFlow Posted Sep 22, 2016 by John Mannes (@JohnMannes) 0 SHARES Next Story 23andMe’s Anne Wojcicki has a plan to include better genetic data from people of color Pretty much 100 percent of my generation is obsessed with Instagram. Unfortunately, I left the platform (sorry all) back in 2015. Simple reason, I am way too indecisive about which photos to post and what pithy caption to give them. Provided by Google Fortunately, with ample spare time, those who share my problem can now use an image captioning model in TensorFlow to caption their photos and put an end to the pesky first-world problem. I can’t wait for the beauty on the right to start rolling in the likes with the ever-creative  “A person on a beach flying a kite.” Jokes aside, the technology developed by research scientists on Google’s Brain Team is actually quite impressive. Google is touting a 93.9 percent accuracy rate for “Show and Tell,” the cute name Google has given the project. Previous versions fell between 89.6 percent and 91.8 percent accuracy. For any form of classification, a small change in accuracy will have a disproportionately large impact on usability. To get to this point, the team had to train both the vision and language frameworks with captions created by real people. This prevents the system from simply naming objects in a frame. Rather than just noting sand, kite and person in the above image, the system can generate a full descriptive sentence. The key to building an accurate model is taking into account the way objects relate to one another. The man is flying the kite, it’s not just a man with a kite above him. Provided by Google The team also notes that their model is more than just a really complex parrot that spits back entries from its training set of images. From the image on the left, you can see how patterns from a synthesis of images are combined to create original captions in previously unseen images. Prior versions of the image captioning model took three seconds per training step on an Nvidia G20 GPU, but the version open sourced today can do the same task in a quarter of that time, or just 0.7 seconds. That means that today’s version is even more sophisticated than the version that tied for first in last year’s Microsoft COCO image captioning challenge. Earlier this year at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference in Las Vegas, Google discussed a model they had created that could identify objects within an image and build a caption by aggregating disparate features from a training set of images captioned by humans. The key strength of this model is its ability to bridge logical gaps to connect objects with context. This is one of the features that will eventually make this technology useful for scene recognition when a computer vision system needs to differentiate from, let’s say, a person running from police and a bystander fleeing a violent scene.

 Two famous Google alums are advising a secret startup building the 'eyes of the smart home' Biz Carson Sep. 22, 2016, 6:25 PM 6,990 facebook linkedin twitter email print Alex Teichman/LinkedIn; Sebastian Thrun/Udacity; Andy Rubin/Reuters; Henrik Dahlkamp/LinkedIn; Samantha Lee/Business Insider Alex Teichman crawled on the carpet as the dog ran around him. A camera watched them closely nearby.  On the screen of the computer, Teichman's outline was glaring red, despite him being on all fours like the dog. The pet, though, was a shining green.  It was graduation day from Stanford's StartX incubator, and Teichman and his cofounder Hendrik Dahlkamp had built a home security system that can tell the difference between humans, a potential threat, and things like dogs running around a yard.  However, the video of Teichman versus the dog is the last public evidence of a company then-called Snitch. In early 2015, IEEE wrote the only story about what the duo was working on, complete with the video.   Since then, though, buzz has been slowly building around the "well-funded" and "first-rate" mysterious company and its newly discovered ties to major Google alums. With its focus on machine vision and their expertise in self-driving cars, speculation about the project's potential is growing. A few recent clues discovered by Business Insider hint at what the tight-lipped startup might be working on. The mystery of Snitch Snitch's founding team is two guys with brilliant minds and backgrounds to match, a pair that many Silicon Valley investors would be delighted to throw money at. Teichman's mentor was Sebastian Thrun, the "father of the self-driving car" who founded Google X. At Stanford, Teichman had worked in Thrun's lab and was the perception lead on Stanford's self-driving car. His summers were spent interning at famed robotics research lab Willow Garage. Years before, Teichman had suffered from a nagging worry that his house was going to get burglarized, according to a story in IEEE. He had been receiving random phone calls, and there had been a notice of an uptick of crime in the neighborhood. So he rigged up his own security camera and loaded it with the self-driving technology that he had been working on. He wanted to be able to tell the difference between a tree branch in the wind or a burglar entering the backyard. But nothing came of it since his house wasn't robbed. At Stanford, Teichman met his co-founder, Dahlkamp, who also specialized in seeing the world in different ways. He had cofounded the technology behind Google Street View and also went to Stanford to study under Thrun and work on its self-driving car. The two were at a party together when Dahlkamp brought up the old security system Teichman had built. Only then did Teichman realize it might form the basis of a company.  In October 2014, they incorporated the business. Months later, they graduated from the Stanford StartX labs. And then they all but disappeared. Business Insider has found a few clues, however.  In November 2015, the pair's mentor, Thrun, tried to find some new talent for the startup, which he described as "well-funded." "I have an amazing job opportunity in Silicon Valley. A small, first-rate, well-funded team is seeking to hire an RGBD perception expert to help build the 'eyes of the smart home'," Thrun wrote in a robotics forum. (Interested applicants had to e-mail Edwin Jarvis, a cheeky nod to the AI butler from the "Iron Man" series.) Also, at some point Teichman posted a plea on 99Designs, a website for freelance logo design, looking for an image to go with the name at the time, Snitch: "I'm building an intelligent home security system that uses a totally new kind of camera and can understand what it's seeing, rather than just detecting that something changed," Teichman wrote. "It's super cool but I can't draw for s--. Help!" The winning design, a grey-and-blue camera, can be found on two websites: Kortschak Investments and Playground Global. Playground Global is run by Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android operating system who left Google in October 2014 to start a hardware incubator. Turns out that Dahlkamp and Teichman have been incubating the company in Rubin's Playground Global over the last year, according to a job posting from their recruiter Doreen Xia on a computer vision forum. From Snitch to Lighthouse Although Playground is a hardware incubator, according to new trademark filings, the young company is now more concerned with software for security cameras — and it has a new name: Lighthouse. The trademark covers computer software for a range of tasks, from viewing and analyzing video to operating, managing, and monitoring security systems. The trademark covers not only the computer software but also "software as a service", or a licensing model that would let people subscribe to using the software over time. Today, Lighthouse's website only teases something "Coming soon." The company declined to talk to Business Insider. Andy Rubin, Playground Global, and Sebastian Thrun didn't respond to request for comment.  Still, venture capitalists are buzzing about it, wondering if it could dethrone Google's Nest in the camera market. Since it's not making its own camera, unlike Nest which acquired Dropcam, it will have a harder time getting its software in the hands of people, one investor speculated.  Others are excited to see the technology behind self-driving cars be applied to other areas beyond the much-hyped automotive space. Lighthouse might be the first breakout company to do it.   SEE ALSO: This 24-year-old Harvard dropout wants to rid the world of multiple-choice tests like the SAT NOW WATCH: A tiny camera that sticks to any solid surface takes the ultimate selfie Loading video...

Economy Google satellite images have revealed these four mysterious new constructions on Itu Aba Gavin Fernando, news.com.auSeptember 23, 2016 8:24am IMAGES of mysterious new constructions on a disputed Taiwanese island have prompted the country’s government into damage control mode. The Taiwanese government has asked Google to blur satellite images of Itu Aba, the country’s sole holding in the disputed South China Sea, after aerial shots surfaced of mysterious new constructions on the region’s border. The photos, which are currently still visible on Google Earth, show four tetrapod structures set up in a semicircle just off the northwestern shoreline of the island, around three or four storeys high. media_cameraAnother view of the mysterious constructions. The images have prompted speculation over what exactly is being housed there, and whether China and Taiwan are planning on taking joint aggressive action over the disputed region. A spokesman for Taiwan Defence Ministry confirmed they wanted evidence of the structures hidden, saying: “Under the precondition of protecting military secrets and security, we have requested Google blur images of important military facilities.” But other than that, Taiwan remains tight-lipped on the subject, refusing to delve into the structures’ purpose. The request to Google came shortly after reports speculated the structures could be blockhouse towers for anti-aircraft gun installations. But Taiwan’s Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan would not confirm or deny these reports. “It is inconvenient for us to reveal any military facilities we are installing on Taiping Island and what their purposes are as they are all considered secrets,” he told reporters. He also assured the public that “Taiping Island has strong defensive capability”. The objects were not on the previous map taken by satellite in January last year, meaning they’re a relatively new construction. The country’s silence prompts further speculation that Taipei may be ramping up its defence after an international ruling on the disputed area in July. Both China and Taiwan, which China views as a renegade province, vehemently rejected the court ruling. media_cameraChina and Taiwan could be ramping up their defence in the South China Sea following the international tribunal in July. Whatever it is, the objects are clearly sensitive in nature, and the government isn’t too keen on the rest of the world knowing about them. Military experts have speculated that the constructions are most likely defensive in nature, saying Taipei is likely to be working on building its intelligence and surveillance capabilities. A security expert from Macquarie University told news.com.au it was difficult to pinpoint exactly what the structures are, but ruled out some of the speculation based on the satellite image. “They’re too small and in a strange pattern to be harbours or ports,” he said. “They could house sensors for surveillance, but the southern most structure doesn’t point out to sea.” He also suggested they may house coastal artillery, but added this wasn’t likely. “(If so), you’d expect them scattered around the entire island, and not concentrated in one place.” Cannon bases have likewise been ruled out, given that the surrounding saltwater would be likely to rust the material. Macau-based military expert Antony Wong Dong said they were most likely to be large coastal forts set up for defensive purposes, but warned they could be equipped with heavy machineguns. “The surrounding area ... is the most suitable landing beach on Taiping. Such kinds of construction were only found in Germany during the World War II and Taiwan,” he told the South China Morning Post. “The coastal forts can effectively stop vessels from Vietnam or even deter mainland warships from landing on Taiping.” Google has confirmed that it received the request from the Taiwanese government and is currently reviewing it.

In this opinion piece, Nathan Elly branch manager at Digital Next Australia argues marketers can’t afford to miss these million dollar SEO marketing strategies for 2017. Posted by Nathan Elly The SEO marketing channel has experienced several changes in 2016 and there is still one more major change that is expected to disrupt the tactical execution once the update is released. Marketers need to minimise the risk of this potential disruption by understanding the direction that SEO is going in 2017 and how they can ride the trend to achieve their marketing goals. Penguin 4 will impact website’s rankings based on the types of links pointing to the website. Google is updating their algorithm and web spam identification to combat link spam. Penguin 4.0 is the major algorithm update that people in the SEO industry are waiting to see released so that a link acquisition strategy can be put forward in 2017. We know that low-quality links and unnatural links will be targeted, however naturally acquired links that form the site’s link portfolio will be rewarded by Google. The ideal link building strategy should comply with Google’s terms of service, be acquired from sites that have relevant content and that is also authoritative in your industry. Valuable content will remain at the heart of SEO. Google has always said that “Content is King”; and that trend will continue into 2017. Websites that provide valuable content such as long, detailed guides for their web users tend to outrank sites that publish short copy. A content marketing strategy should be a part of your site’s SEO campaign to ensure that your site gains the maximum keyword visibility and also has the best chance to deliver the value that users are searching for. SEO performance will be influenced by the UX of the site. Google has said that they want webmasters to optimise their site so that it provides a valuable experience for the user. Some of the key areas that need to be focused on include: Web page loading speed People are demanding that they receive access to content as quickly as possible. On average, a web user is prepared to wait for 2 seconds before they move onto the next website. Google has incorporated this into their algorithm and if your site isn’t loading its content in under 2 seconds, then it is unlikely that it will rank for the top search terms in your SEO campaign. Interstitials Google is targeting Interstitials in the first quarter of 2017. According to their Webmaster blog, it’s being targeted in response to improving users experiences on mobile devices. At times, the pop-ups make it difficult to access the web content. Your SEO strategy needs to assess the risk of your site being targeted and what changes can be made should the site be affected. Mobile friendliness Smart devices from phones to tablets have taken the world by storm and Google wants webmasters to make sure that their content is optimised for the appropriate device. (See their post on mobile friendliness here.) Responsive design layouts and mobile app integrations will gain importance for getting higher rankings in the organic search results. Google’s Developer Console offers tools that can help to display the site appropriately on different web platforms. Google AMP Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages is a project aimed at improving the speed of serving content to mobile devices. As more people engage with web content on their mobile devices, Google will start to favour website’s using Google AMP in the organic search results. Bounce rate. Google wants to send users of its search engine to websites that will help them solve what it is they are looking for. Sites that have a high bounce rate trigger signals to Google that the web page content isn’t valuable or relevant to the user’s search query. It’s important that the website is optimised for users to engage with the website so that any bounce rate signals are avoided. Advertise with us It’s great that brands are preparing their 2017 campaigns now, however a contingency plan might be needed should Google make significant changes before the new year. By prioritising the areas that have been highlighted, there should be minimal disruption to the execution of the brand’s SEO tactics.

A mere Google search for Keith Lamont Scott turns up the Google suggestion of “Keith Lamont Scott criminal record,” which indicates that plenty of people are searching for Scott’s criminal record. Keith Lamont Scott Shooting Video Released — Wife: ‘He Doesn’t Have A Gun, He Has A TBI’ [Graphic Video, Photo] <noscript><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="http://cdn.inquisitr.com/3535437/keith-lamont-scott-shooting-video-released-he-doesnt-have-a-gun-he-has-a-tbi-graphic-videos/embed/#?secret=4zqsCo2n3l" data-secret="4zqsCo2n3l" width="500" height="282" title="&#8220;Keith Lamont Scott Shooting Video Released &#8212; Wife: &#8216;He Doesn&#8217;t Have A Gun, He Has A TBI&#8217; [Graphic Video, Photo]&#8221; &#8212; The Inquisitr News" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></noscript> In terms of an investigative point of view, the criminal history and record of Scott could be relevant. However, detractors might view looking into his criminal history as demonizing the shooting victim after his death. Nevertheless, some say that what is relevant is what happened between Scott and the police officer that shot him on Tuesday in Charlotte. The fallout from that killing has caused the city of Charlotte to be placed under a state of emergency in North Carolina. According to WBRC, Scott did indeed have a criminal record — and his criminal record spanned three states. [Photo by Gerry Broome/AP Images] Keith’s criminal record spanned from Texas to South Carolina to North Carolina — with the irony being that part of Scott’s criminal record included aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Whether that deadly weapon was a gun or not also remains to be seen, as more details about Scott’s criminal record continue to emerge. Since there is controversy over whether or not Keith had a gun when Officer Vinson shot and killed him, some say that Keith’s criminal record is essential as a predictor to his actions on Tuesday. Others say that Scott’s criminal history has no bearing on the deadly events that happened Tuesday — and that police would not have known of his criminal history when they approached his vehicle. Whether police ran Scott’s license plates prior to approaching his vehicle is not known. It also is not known who police were really searching for when they sought to serve a warrant to a different person — and if they criminally and racially profiled Keith as that potential person instead. Whereas the family of Keith Lamont Scott and other witnesses state that he was simply reading a book when undercover police officers approached his vehicle and ultimately shot and killed him, authorities claim that a gun was in Scott’s hand and was recovered at the scene. [Photo by Chuck Burton/AP Images] In terms of additional criminal records for Scott, his Texas records further reveal that he experienced a conviction for evading arrest with a vehicle in 2005 — a fact that certain folks would say would play into the way that Keith may have responded to authorities. However, with Scott’s daughter claiming that Officer Vinson was wearing plainclothes and not police attire when he approached Keith’s vehicle, it isn’t known if he was aware that Vinson was indeed a police officer. The remaining facts of Keith’s criminal record include a 1992 guilty plea for a charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Scott’s criminal record also reveals in 2004 a misdemeanor assault conviction in North Carolina, a state that is now experiencing a lot of unrest due to his death. Feedback from social media about Keith’s criminal record can be read below. “Attorney #Bamburg for #KeithL.Scott speaking out of school; has an extensive criminal record including assault w/weapons.” “‘Scott loved the police, he worked with them so many times!’ *looks at criminal record* Yeah, that’s one way of putting it…” “You talk about all video and investigation facts being released! What about Scott’s Criminal Record & Police Run-ins?” “This woman brought up Scott’s criminal record just to say it won’t matter in court because it’s not relevant at the time. So why bring it up.” “Mr. Scott had a criminal record; this justifies murder. Sad.” [Featured Photo by Gerry Broome/AP Images] Now Watch This: Biden and Obama Memes Take Over The Internet Now Read This: Florida Teacher Allegedly Told Black Students, ‘Don’t Make Me Call Donald Trump And Get You Sent Back To Africa’ Share 328 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Paula Mooney Tags: Keith Lamont Scott Criminal Record Comments LATEST HEADLINES New Zealand Cows Rescued: Earthquake Survivors Of The Bovine Kind Man Charged With Murder And Dismemberment Of Lactose-Intolerant Two-Year-Old Kyrian Knox Who Cried When Given Milk Prince Harry’s New Love Meghan Markle Caught In Nude Photo Scandal With Another Man Houston Texans Vs.

App Preview Messaging is Google’s attempt at dealing with the increasing number of messaging apps today that are often isolated and not cross-compatible with each other. The feature will eventually be available to all messaging app developers, but in the meantime it is in preview for several partners. We realize that making it easy to reach the right contact isn’t just a challenge for our users — it’s also a challenge for many messaging app developers. So, we’re also opening up this feature to developers with an early access program, allowing them to extend the reach of their messaging app. To help “reach your friends and family” that use different apps, App Preview Messaging lets Android users “send messages through their messaging app to any of the contacts in their phonebook.” While the sender could be using an iOS device, the receiver must be on Android as App Preview Messaging is a part of Google Play Services. All users will have full control over this feature and can turn it off in settings. App Preview Messaging notifications are much taller than regular Peek notifications. They only exist in the notification shade and if swiped away cannot be brought back without installing the app. As you may know, it features the sender’s profile image in the top left, a small app icon, and sender details. Users can reply to the message with buttons to install the app or ignore the message at the bottom. Overall, this is an interesting plan by Google to help developers solve the problem of fragmentation in messaging apps. Of course, Google itself is contributing to the already crowded messaging field with Allo and Duo. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

Green spaces disappear from Google Maps Erin Ross | NPR Show caption The Allegheny National Forest is absent from Google Maps (right) but displayed on Apple Maps (left). Apple & Google/Screenshots by NPR Share Share via Emailemail Share on Twitter Share on Facebook If you looked at Google Maps this week, you might have noticed something strange: There is less green. Typically, mint green highlights designate publicly owned wild spaces on Google's maps. But as of this writing, some of those public lands have gone gray. The locations are still searchable, but if you don't already know the park or forest exists, and where exactly, you might not be able to find it. No green space is safe: Many of the missing parks are national forests, but some are state forests, Bureau of Land Management recreation areas, wildlife refuges and wilderness areas. Some, like the Blue Hills Reservation in Massachusetts are just a few thousand acres. Others, like the Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania, are over 500,000. The first clue to Google's de-greening came Tuesday night, when your blogger was casually browsing maps of national forests (as one does). Sometime in the last few weeks, the 1.6-million acre Willamette National Forest in Oregon's Cascade region had gone from green to gray. "I was surprised to see we'd lost our government status!" said Karen Kanes, spokeswoman for the no-longer-mapped national forest. Google — which acknowledges its maps do have "occasional inaccuracies" — was displaying the forest in off-white like private lands, with its location marked at the headquarters in a nearby town. Apple (left) and Google screenshots of the Willamette National Forest. The pins in each image indicate where each app says the forest is located, when searched. Apple & Google/Screenshots by NPR Apple & Google/Screenshots by NPR And why was the Willamette National Forest unworthy, while bordering Umpqua, Deschutes, and Mt. Hood national forests got to stay? "We haven't noticed something like this before," says Donavan Albert, who runs the National Forest Service's own locator map that's based on Google Maps. "I've seen minor discrepancies between their data and ours, but never an entire forest." Albert's locator map in fact offers one easy way of seeing data missing from Google Maps as it layers outlines of national forests' borders over what would normally be Google's mint-green spaces. Yet currently, several areas are bordered but not filled. Large chunks are gone from the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest in Utah. North of Yellowstone, the Beaverhead-Deerlodge, Gallatin National Forests, and Custer National Forest are grayed out entirely. The National Forest Service's own locator map is based on Google Maps, offering one way to see data missing from Google Maps as it layers outlines of national forests' borders over what would normally be Google's mint-green spaces. Courtesy of the National Forest Service And this is only the federally owned forests. The National Forest Service map does not display grasslands, state parks, wilderness areas or wildlife refuges. The majority of New York's public lands, for instance, are state-owned. "Well, that's odd," said Neil Woodworth, executive director of the Adirondack Mountain Club, who was near the Catskill Park in New York when I reached him. He pulled out his topographical maps to compare with Google's. Most of the Catskills were spared, while large chunks of Adirondack Park to their north appeared grayed out. "The entire High Peaks Wilderness is just gone," Woodworth said. And if you're thinking you could just switch to Apple Maps — not so fast. Those aren't entirely accurate either. Along the Virginia-West Virginia border, Google and Apple present almost reverse images of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, displaying either mostly the George Washington National Forest or the Jefferson National Forest but not both of them, together in their entirety. Apple (left) and Google (right) present different parts of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests along the Virginia-West Virginia border, displaying either mostly the George Washington National Forest or the Jefferson National Forest but not the two together in their entirety. Apple & Google/Screenshots by NPR In Florida, Apple is missing a substantial chunk of Everglades National Park, and Google doesn't show a nearby wildlife refuge or Kissimmee Prairie Preserve State Park. In Massachusetts, Bradley Palmer State Park is missing from Google Maps, while Willowdale State Forest across the road is missing from Apple Maps. But! Both apps display the nearby Turner Hill golf course. To the inquiry about the disappearing public lands, a Google representative first asked NPR to clarify the problem. ("What do you mean by 'Willamette National Forest is missing?' " spokeswoman Elizabeth Davidoff wrote in an email and shared a link to the Willamette National Forest offices in Springfield, Ore., about 17 miles from the forest's non-existent border.) But she also offered a statement detailing the complexity of data that goes into drawing Google Maps: "Our basemap data - things like place names, borders, and road networks - comes from a combination of third-party providers, public sources, and user contributions. Overall, this provides a very comprehensive and up-to-date map of the US, but we recognize that there may be occasional inaccuracies that could arise from any of those sources." Google, in the statement, also encouraged users to flag discrepancies with a "Report a Problem" tool at the bottom-right corner of maps. Apple did not respond to NPR's inquiry. This isn't the first time errors have been found on Google or Apple maps. In March, a construction company tore down the wrong house and blamed Google. In 2012, Apple CEO Tim Cook issued an apology after numerous problems with Apple Maps, one of which led Australian police to call the maps life-threatening. People searching for the town of Mildura were sent up 43 miles away to a remote part of the desert. The public-lands errors are unlikely to be life-threatening, but they can get confusing. It's less common for people to rely on digital maps for hiking — with sparse cell service and reliability of detailed ink-and-paper trail maps. Plus, "Google Maps doesn't do too great with trailheads and parking areas," Woodworth says. But digital maps are still a key tool for trip planning. "When I'm somewhere new I usually turn to the Internet to find parks and green spaces to explore," wrote Reddit user Bengal859, who used Apple Maps this month to find a park near Lake Erie in Ohio. But the Forest Service representatives assure: Just because their lands aren't on Google, it doesn't mean they're not there. The best SoCal news in your inbox, daily.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google’s Pixel phones stole the wrong feature from Apple’s iPhone 7 Chris Smith BGR NewsSeptember 22, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Come early October, Google will launch its 2016 flagship phones: these are HTC-made, Pixel-branded premium smartphones that will run a customized version of Android and cost you quite a bit more than you're used to spending for a Google phone. They’ll also look very much like an iPhone 7, at least the front side — not that it’s a bad thing at this point. While many of the specs and features of the Pixel and Pixel XL are already known, a new report says the phones won’t be able to handle water spills very well at all. If only Google had followed Apple's lead here and made the phones water-resistant, instead of following Apple's lead elsewhere. DON’T MISS: 7 ways Apple’s iPhone 7 is much better than any Samsung phone According to the well-informed blog Android Police, a site that revealed many details about the two Pixel handsets, both the Pixel and Pixel XL will have an IP53 certification. The “5” in there says that your Pixel phone will be pretty safe from dust damage, as dust particles will have a hard time getting in it. The “3” says the Pixel isn’t even water-resistant at all, let alone waterproof. The rating indicates the phone will survive contact with water, as long as it’s held in an upright position at an angle that doesn't exceed 60 degrees from vertical while being sprayed with low-pressure water. So if the phone is placed horizontally on a table or counter and you spill water on it, you might be in trouble. In other words, as long as the phone’s ports do not come in contact with liquid, you should be safe. Comparatively, this year’s top phones including the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 series are water-resistant (ratings of IP68 and IP67, respectively), which means they can still function after being immersed in shallow water for a limited amount of time. So if you drop them in the pool, you’ll still be able to use them.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Hardware issue may cause random reboots in Nexus 5X upgraded to Nougat By John Hoff - September 22, 2016 23 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter So this isn’t good news at all for Nexus 5X users. Although this handy smartphone from last year is part of the lucky list who will be getting the upgrade to Android Nougat, it seems that Google has identified a hardware issue that might cause your device to have random reboots when upgraded to Android 7.0. There is very little we know about the issue, and Google is not very forthcoming with information on what is causing this. So on to what we do know – first, that Google confirms “very few” of the Nexus 5X devices in the wild are affected by this issue. Secondly, Google is pointing to a “hardware issue” of some sort causing the random reboots. As to what that hardware issue is, we really have no clue yet. The solution? Well, apparently there is no easy fix that you can do on your own – Google will have to take in your unit for warranty service. This may or may not mean that you will be getting a replacement unit. As far as the developer community is concerned, a full wipe and factory reset does NOT fix the issue. Downgrading to Marshmallow is an option, but very few people will find that acceptable. If you’re suffering from this issue, do tell us about it.

The app was originally shown off at the company’s Google I/O conference back in May where the tech giant highlighted the platform’s end-to-end encryption, temporary private messages, AI-powered responses and the ability to reply without typing via Google Assistant. Signing up for Allo does not require a Google account, though just like most messaging services, the platform associates your phone number with the account. Allo also pulls contacts from your address book, allowing users to send SMS messages to all contacts free of charge (for you) even if the recipient doesn’t have the app installed, though this costs the person you’re sending the message to money, depending on their mobile data plan. Google’s new messaging app is also available in the Canadian iOS App Store. Download Allo from the Canadian Google Play Store.

Do Do I’d read what Snowden has to say about “Allo” I’ll pass. 7-down Then you might as well pass on the Internet as a whole. Do Do That’s a brilliant response. I’ll consider it for a 3 seconds 3-2-1. Thanks, I’ll try other options like not doing stupid things online when possible. It’s Me Most people don’t really care about privacy in any way. There are entire companies built around that fact. Do Do The more privacy we give up the more of a power imbalance that’s created and the closer we move towards a tyranny. If people are willing to give their privacy away so easily, soon the government and business will not consider it a “right”. Right now, I don’t need to justify my right to privacy as it’s a “right”. The burden of justification falls on the one seeking to infringe upon the right. One day, as long as more and more people “don’t really care” it won’t be a right and the burden will fall on the public to justify their right to privacy. People need to wake up, it’s not tin foil hat nonsense, it’s happening, There’s another law being put forward that not to many people know about that basically allows the government to put malware on anyone’s computer that “they” think might be up to no good, but if you read how broad their definition is you’d be shocked, they can effectively can put malware on anyone’s computer, period, right now, they need a warrant, if they get their way they won’t. People won’t have to worry about privacy because there won’t be any at all. We’ll basically be fascist society at that point. It’s Me Dazzle them with tricks and trinkets and baubles and the bedazzled and befuddled masses will give up almost anything. Do Do Ya, I suppose…but I’m not giving up. thereasoner I have nothing to hide….from the police or government because I’m law abiding. That doesn’t mean that I don’t value my privacy otherwise or believe in free speech. With Allo I can have privacy if I want it but I can also have Google Now like features as well. The best of both worlds and that’s a good thing! Do Do “I have nothing to hide….from the police or government because I’m law abiding. ” I find it amazing that in 2016 some people still say and or believe that myth is true. I think if you were honest with yourself you’d admit that’s not true and you’d also realize that if it were up to Government and Business YOU wouldn’t be the one deciding what that “nothing” is. I’m pretty sure they’d decide you do have something to hide and they want to know it and then you’d regret it. It’s Me When Schmidt said exactly that 7 years ago, people didn’t really take him seriously. They assumed he was just kidding. But he was very prescient. Not long after defending invading privacy, people now mindlessly ape his glib explanation. “If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place.” He also talked about how people look at Google like a trusted friend you want to share info with. Can you imagine how creepy it would be to walk into a friend’s house and see that he has basically a shrine to you with a record of your conversations, who you talked to, you calls, your movements, your purchases, your nocturnal activities, your friends, your viewing habits, etc, etc. That’s not a friend, that’s a stalker. Anyway, one can’t fault google for it. If people will so easily give up their privacy, (even if the have to kid themselves that’s it’s for their own good or they have any actually control when things are opt out) some one should make money off of them. Good for google for being so successful at it. Facebook too. They make data mining and giving privacy fun and enjoyable 😉 thereasoner Well give me an example then, you must have a ton of them considering your strong stance. I honestly can’t think of anything and I’m not being coy when I say that I would be of absolutely zero interest to the government or authorities. Mind you, I’m in my 50s now so 20 years ago I probably couldn’t say that but today it’s a given. Do Do Hopefully you’ll take the time to read this from 2012. Especially number 2. Every so often, you hear the argument “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear”, in order to justify increased and invasive surveillance. This argument is not only dangerous, but dishonest and cowardly, too. In the comments to yesterday’s post about Sweden’s DNA register, some expressed the “nothing to hide” argument – that efficiency of law enforcement should always be an overriding factor in any society-building, usually expressed as “if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear”. This is a very dangerous mindset. The argument is frequently raised in debates by pro-big brother hawks, and doing so is dangerous, cowardly, and dishonest. There are at least four good reasons to reject this argument solidly and uncompromisingly: The rules may change, it’s not you who determine if you’re guilty, laws must be broken for society to progress, and privacy is a basic human need. Let’s look at these in detail. They go from the less important and more obvious, to the less obvious and more important. One – The rules may change: Once the invasive surveillance is in place to enforce rules that you agree with, the ruleset that is being enforced could change in ways that you don’t agree with at all – but then, it is too late to protest the surveillance. For example, you may agree to cameras in every home to prevent domestic violence (“and domestic violence only”) – but the next day, a new political force in power could decide that homosexuality will again be illegal, and they will use the existing home cameras to enforce their new rules. Any surveillance must be regarded in terms of how it can be abused by a worse power than today’s. Two – It’s not you who determine if you have something to fear: You may consider yourself law-abidingly white as snow, and it won’t matter a bit. What does matter is whether you set off the red flags in the mostly-automated surveillance, where bureaucrats look at your life in microscopic detail through a long paper tube to search for patterns. When you stop your car at the main prostitution street for two hours every Friday night, the Social Services Authority will draw certain conclusions from that data point, and won’t care about the fact that you help your elderly grandmother – who lives there – with her weekly groceries. When you frequently stop at a certain bar on your way driving home from work, the Department of Driving Licenses will draw certain conclusions as to your eligibility for future driving licenses – regardless of the fact that you think they serve the world’s best reindeer meatballs in that bar, and never had had a single beer there. People will stop thinking in terms of what is legal, and start acting in self-censorship to avoid being red-flagged, out of pure self-preservation. (It doesn’t matter that somebody in the right might possibly and eventually be cleared – after having been investigated for six months, you will have lost both custody of your children, your job, and possibly your home.) Two and a half – Point two assumes that the surveillance even has correct data, which it has been proven time and again to frequently not have. Three – Laws must be broken for society to progress: A society which can enforce all of its laws will stop dead in its tracks. The mindset of “rounding up criminals is good for society” is a very dangerous one, for in hindsight, it may turn out that the criminals were the ones in the moral right. Less than a human lifetime ago, if you were born a homosexual, you were criminal from birth. If today’s surveillance level had existed in the 1950s and 60s, the lobby groups for sexual equality could never have formed; it would have been just a matter of rounding up the organized criminals (“and who could possibly object to fighting organized crime?”). If today’s surveillance level had existed in the 1950s and 60s, homosexuality would still be illegal and homosexual people would be criminals by birth. It is an absolute necessity to be able to break unjust laws for society to progress and question its own values, in order to learn from mistakes and move on as a society. Four – Privacy is a basic human need: Implying that only the dishonest people have need of any privacy ignores a basic property of the human psyche, and sends a creepy message of strong discomfort. We have a fundamental need for privacy. I lock the door when I go to the men’s room, despite the fact that nothing secret happens in there: I just want to keep that activity to myself, I have a fundamental need to do so, and any society must respect that fundamental need for privacy. In every society that doesn’t, citizens have responded with subterfuge and created their own private areas out of reach of the governmental surveillance, not because they are criminal, but because doing so is a fundamental human need. Finally, it could be noted that this argument is also commonly used by the authorities themselves to promote surveillance and censorship, while rejecting transparency and free speech. Those who want to have a little fun can play the reverse card as illustrated by Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal. The next time you hear anybody say “if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear”, tell them that’s an absolutely false and dangerous argument, and point them at this article. thereasoner Look, I’m not arguing the merits of or the cons of a society under increased surveillance or the value of privacy itself, what I’m trying to figure out is how this applies to Allo. If Google didn’t offer the privacy and encryption that anyone can have in incognito mode then you would have something but that’s simply not the case here. So I can only presume that the problem for YOU is that I and others have the freedom to choose not to use incognito mode in favor of the Google AI assistant features. So basically YOUR views on a society under surveillance should trump my freedom of choice. I understand perfectly your “number two” that you thought would be such a convincing argument to take away my freedom. I still disagree because if I do write a provocative text with details of terrorists like destruction and mayhem that going to take place or even just use key words or phrases that set off monitors then I would want MY post “red flagged” and I would want YOURS and ANYONE else’s flagged as well. Personally, I think that anyone who doesn’t want this because the authorities might read their text is just being paranoid and selfish. Just use incognito mode then and stop thinking that everyone is like you, NOBODY said that you have to use Googles AI assistant! Those who do want that should still have the rights and freedom to do so if they choose! So, beyond me inexplicably deciding to become a terrorist is their any REALISTIC reason why the government or authorities would even notice me? thereasoner You can have the same privacy and encryption in Allo, you just need to use incognito. It makes sense because of Google Assistant. You can’t have the AI features in incognito mode because it can’t see/read encrypted texts. Those who want to participate with Google Assistant much like Google Now won’t use incognito but for sensitive text only. I love it so far, it’s very cool but then I’m all in on Google Now as well. As for Snowden, we don’t need his comments in the matter, that you have a choice to use encryption or not in Allo was already stated by Google ages ago!

Francois Roy Embarrassing display Brad Fortin No mention of how Google changed their mind from storing messages “transiently and in non-identifiable form” to permanently storing and data-mining messages? Yes, there’s Incognito, but Google still reneged on their previous statements and decided to prioritize data-mining over privacy. Mr_Smoosh I was expecting the same from the story. Good thing it’s mentioned elsewhere. FlamesFan89 To be fair, they had an entire article dedicated specifically to that topic. John W Yep, google fan here… valid point… it does kind of suck that they’re doing this… I suspect they’ll renege on that soon due to the backlash. Also, kind of seems like an unfinished product… it’s needs to be really compelling to get people to switch platforms. They met their ‘summer’ deadline by only hours releasing it at night on the last day of summer. The assistant is cool, but is it enough to get people to switch? I’m not so sure.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | September 22, 2016 -- 20:40 GMT (13:40 PDT) | Topic: Developer Google on Thursday launched its virtual reality software development kit (SDK) out of beta, adding native integration of Google's VR platform in Unity, among other improvements. The headsets and smartphones compatible with Google's VR platform, called Daydream, won't be available until later this fall, and more information is "coming soon", Google promised in a blog post. In the meantime, developers can start building Daydream apps with the SDK 1.0 and the DIY developer kit. Google is also now taking applications for its Daydream Access Program, which gives developers the opportunity to work with Google engineers on Daydream content. "When you create content for the Daydream platform, you know your apps will work seamlessly across every Daydream-ready phone and headset," wrote Product Manager Nathan Martz. The updated SDK supports integrated asynchronous reprojection, high-fidelity spatialized audio, and interactions using the Daydream controller. With native Daydream integration in Unity, developers can exploit Unity's optimizations in VR rendering. It also adds support for features like head tracking, deep linking, and easy Android manifest configuration. Google also made improvements to its UE4 native integration, introducing Daydream controller support in the editor, a neck model, and new rendering optimizations. special feature VR and AR: The Business Reality Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are going to be useful for far more than just gaming.

Reuters/Stephen Lam Google Allo has challenged Apple’s latest iOS 10 iMessage features. The iOS 10 update by the tech giant gave its fans some pretty amazing features. Fans have loved Apple’s iMessage along with some other features the iOS 10 update brought. As per iTech Post, users can add incredible effects to their messages and also stickers. However, Google has come up with Allo and it seems Apple will have some hard time competing against it. But is it good enough to take away the attention from iMessage? Google has already announced its highly-anticipated messaging app Google Allo but whether it is better than iMessage, that only time will tell. Google is also a tech giant and a new product or service is bound to create buzz. But the real competition starts once the initial hype and hoopla has died down. Google Allo is the search giant’s latest offering to fans and it’s an open challenge to Apple. It’s an AI-centric, smart, modern day chat app that will offer features aimed at improving messaging conversations manifold, writes CNET. The Google Allo chat app has a built-in image search feature like Apple’s iMessage. It also has a built-in assistant to assist users search information on the web. This is where Google may score over iMessage as Apple users still have to exit iMessage to access Apple digital assistant Siri. Google Allo has a long way to go to prove if it’s better than Apple iMessage. However, it’s a nice start and just like Apple, Google too will look forward to bettering its chat app via regular updates. The Google Assistant is reportedly the coolest feature in Google Allo as it’s basically the whole of Google in a chat box.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How Do You Check Google Chrome’s Version Without It Automatically Updating Itself? Sometimes you need to know the particular version of a program you have installed without all the hassle of automatic updates or other “problems” getting in the way. Is there an easy way to do it? Today’s SuperUser Q&A post helps a reader check Google Chrome’s version without the updating issues. Today’s Question & Answer session comes to us courtesy of SuperUser—a subdivision of Stack Exchange, a community-driven grouping of Q&A web sites. The Question SuperUser reader Franck Dernoncourt wants to know how to check Google Chrome’s version without it automatically updating itself: I know that Google Chrome’s version information can be checked by going to chrome://help. However, if Google Chrome is not up to date, it will automatically update itself without asking the user. How can I check the version of Google Chrome installed on my computer without it automatically updating itself? I use Google Chrome on Windows 7 SP1 x64 Ultimate. How do you check Google Chrome’s version without it automatically updating itself? The Answer SuperUser contributor DavidPostill has the answer for us: Below are some possibilities. Type chrome://version in Google Chrome’s Address Bar The version number will be displayed: Check the Version Using “Programs and Features” In the Windows Start Menu, select Control Panel, then Programs and Features. The version number will be displayed in the last column: Turn Off Google Update, Then Type chrome://version in Google Chrome’s Address Bar To check for updates, Google Chrome uses two system services, Google Update Service (gupdate) and Google Update Service (gupdatem). To turn off automatic updates in Google Chrome, we have to disable these Google services. You can disable these services easily from the System Configuration window by following these steps. Keep in mind that turning off automatic updates should be done with caution. You may not receive the latest security updates if you do not automatically or manually update Google Chrome frequently. 1. Make sure that you save all open tabs in Google Chrome if you want to restore them later, then close the browser. 2. Press Windows+R to open the Run Command dialogue box. 3. Type msconfig in the box and press Enter to open the System Configuration window. 4. In the System Configuration window, select the Services Tab. 5. At the bottom, select/check the box Hide All Microsoft Services. This will hide all services related to Microsoft so that you do not disable essential services. 6. Under the Services section, search for and find Google Update Service (gupdate) and Google Update Service (gupdatem). 7. Deselect/uncheck both Google services and click Apply. Click OK to save the settings. 8. Now you will be asked whether you want to exit without a restart or if you want to restart your computer now. Choose one or the other according to your current situation. That is all there is to it! You have successfully disabled automatic updates in Google Chrome. To check whether the settings have been applied correctly or not, open Google Chrome and click on the Chrome Menu > Help > About Google Chrome. Google Chrome will start checking for any available updates. If you see the “An error occurred while checking for updates: Update check failed to start (error code 3: 0x800704C7 — system level).” message, then you have successfully disabled automatic updates in Google Chrome. Note: When you open Google Chrome the next time, you might be asked to provide administrative access to enable automatic updates in Google Chrome. Simply select No every time.

Pocket-lint Sections Apps Cameras Cars Drones Fitness Trackers Gadgets Games Headphones Laptops Parenting Phones Smart Home Smartwatches Speakers Tablets TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards Google Pixel launch: What happened and can I watch it again? Elyse Betters4 October 2016Phones Google Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google's "Made by Google" event received a lot of hype and anticipation as it promised more than just a new product launch. It was in fact Google's chance to rebrand and reposition itself a serious contender in the consumer electronics space and to show it can compete on hardware as well as software. We expected to see a couple of new Pixel smartphones to replace the outgoing Nexus brand, more information on the company's Daydream virtual reality headset, a new Chromecast streaming dongle, Google Home wireless speaker with the Google Assistant built in, and Google's answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Wi-Fi.  Suffice to say, we got all that, and there was a lot to take in. Fortunately for you, we've rounded up everything that was announced on this page, but if you want to watch the keynote speech again for yourself, you can do. What is "Made by Google" about? Google advertised its 4 October event under the tagline "Made by Google". It's to show that Google is ditching the Nexus brand for its flagship smartphones and that it wants to place greater emphasis on hardware. Up until now, Google has sourced third-party manufacturers to make most of its products, for it to then install its software. What Google now wants to do is have more of an input into the hardware itself so it can fully optimise it to work with its software.  Where can I watch the Made by Google event livestream? The livestream started at 5pm UK time and finished at around 6.30pm. If you want to watch it all again to see Google representatives show how to use all the products and software announced, you can do so on YouTube or by clicking play on the video below. Google has also launched a new website specifically for the event. What did Google launch at the Made by Google event? Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones Bell Google unsurprisingly launched two new smartphones at the event: the Pixel and Pixel XL. The two phones were subject to numerous leaks in the days, weeks and months leading up to the event, so we already had a good idea of what to expect. Needless to say, both Pixel smartphones look incredible and we can't wait to get them in for review. The Pixel is the smaller of the two smartphones, with a 5in full HD AMOLED display with 441ppi (pixels per inch), while the Pixel XL gets a 5.5in 2560x1440 Quad HD display with 534ppi. Both screens are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and both get treated to full metal bodies with a glass panel covering the top third of the rear. This glass panel is where you'll find a fingerprint scanner. Both phones come with a 12-megapixel rear camera with f/2.0 aperture and 4K video support and an 8MP snapper on the front. They'll both be available in three colours: Quite Black, Very Silver and Really Blue. The Pixel has a starting price of £599 while the Pixel XL will be more expensive, starting at £719. Both will be released on October 20. Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Everything you need to know Google Daydream Google As well as outline its Daydream virtual reality platform in more detail than before, Google unveiled its own VR headset due for release in November. Google Daydream View is a similar device to other mobile headsets in that it houses a phone, but will only work with Daydream-ready handsets. At present that's just the Pixel and Pixel XL. It also differs from peers in that it is covered in material, not just plastic, for a more comfortable, less geeky feel. Whether that comes across is debateable as, from where we're standing, it looks a bit like a pair of socks, but at least it is different. The headset and dedicated remote control will retail for £69 in the UK, $79 in the US when they are available next month. The Daydream platform will also be adopted by other manufacturers when they introduce compatible handsets, so you will be able to find VR content more easily than before. Apps and videos will be available through a one-stop, dedicated hub. What is Google Daydream and when is it coming? 4K Chromecast Ultra VentureBeat With 4K video hitting the headlines it made sense for Google to jump on the bandwagon with a 4K Ultra HD-ready version of its Chromecast streaming dongle. What's more, it announced that there will be movies on its Google Play store that are in 4K to view on it. The Chromecast Ultra, which looks like the current Chromecast 2, will also stream UHD content with HDR and even Dolby Vision picture tech if needed. And other content providers' 4K videos will be compatible too. It'll be available from November in the States for $69. Current thinking is that it'll cost £69 in the UK, but might be a little lower. Google 4K Chromecast Ultra: Everything you need to know Google Home Google Google announced an Amazon Echo-like device called Google Home in May, and then at its Made by Google event, it announced when you would be able to get your hands on the speaker. Google Home is a Wi-Fi enabled, voice-activated speaker that works as a smarthome control centre and an assistant for the whole family. You can use it to play entertainment throughout your entire house, manage every-day tasks, and ask Google what you want to know. Google Home also acts as a Chromecast Audio receiver. The device itself has interchangeable bases available in various colours and finishes. Underneath that swappable shell there is a speaker that can playback songs and allow Google Assistant to talk to you. The speaker features dual side-facing passive radiators, which deliver full range, clear highs, and rich bass. At the top of the device there is a capacitive touch display with four LEDs. You'll use this interact with Home, like trigger the Assistant, adjust volume, etc. As for buttons, there are none at the top (just dual mics that listen for your voice). There is a single mute button on the shell. Google Home is able to filter and separate speech from noise and offers "best-in-class voice recognition", according to Google. A big part of Google Home is going to be Google Assistant that powers it. Like Amazon's Echo, it's going to offer a full range of services all powered by your voice and connected into a range of other services and devices. At launch, Google Home works with Nest, SmartThings, Philips Hue, IFTTT, YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora, Google Play Music, TuneIn, and iHeart Radio. Google Home is now available for pre-order in the US for $129. It will be in stores on 4 November. It's coming soon to the UK, Google told Pocket-lint, but it's not yet available to pre-order in the country. What is Google Home, how does it work, and when can you buy it? Google Wi-Fi Google Google has announced a new Wi-Fi router at its Made by Google event. Last year, Google introduced the OnHub router with TP-Link and Asus, but this year, Google has made its own device called Google Wi-Fi. Each base station looks like a Scandinavian-style, double-stacked hockey puck that Google described as a "visually subtle" disk. You can buy multiple routers to form a mesh network. You basically put several of these disks around your home to boost your network, allowing you to get Wi-Fi signal everywhere, from your bathroom to your basement. Think of Google Wi-Fi as an expandable system for better coverage. Instead of one router, multiple routers work together to deliver fast input to throughout your home, Google said. It's basically a modular system. Google Wi-Fi has a feature called Network Assist that allows it to actively manage and optimise your network behind the scenes so you don't have to adjust settings. Google Wi-Fi handles networking automatically, picking channels, etc, and it keeps the signal strong in every corner of your house by transitioning your device to the best router for less congestion and better speed. Google Wi-Fi will be available for pre-order in November in the US. It costs $129 for one base station or $299 for three and should ship in December. It won't be coming to the UK for now, but Google said it “hopes to make it available in the future". Google Wi-Fi router announced, pre-orders start in November Google Andromeda Android Police The Wall Street Journal reported last year that Google is attempting to fold Chrome OS into Android. Engineers at Google have reportedly been trying to combine the two systems over the past three years, with the goal of unveiling a single, unified operating system by 2017. Google 'Pixel 3' laptop running Andromeda OS planned for 2017 For instance, more recently, Android Police claimed Google will release a Bison/Pixel 3 convertible laptop in Q3 2017, while 9to5Google said a Nexus-branded, 7-inch tablet made by Huawei will arrive by the end of 2016. Both these devices will run a new OS called Andromeda, which is thought to be the name of Google's hybrid Android/Chrome OS. What is Google Andromeda? We expected to hear more about Andromeda at Google's event but sadly this wasn't the case. If rumours about devices running the new OS are true, we could see a separate event later in the year.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google VR SDK out of beta just in time for Oct 4 event Chris Burns - Sep 22, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit This week Google announced that their very own virtual reality software developer kit was graduating out of beta. This announcement came just in time for the release of their all-encompassing hardware and software event, set to take place on the 4th of October. At that event we’ll likely see new software for all Android devices, but specifically for two new devices Google will (likely) introduce as their first Pixel-branded phones. There, Google Daydream can begin to take off. This release of Google VR SDK 1.0 allows complete support for Daydream, and will allow developers a running start at creating top-notch mobile VR apps for the platform before Google goes all-in on advertising. Developers will be able to work with a simple interface that allows editing in what Google describes as “Daydream-ready phones and headsets.” Wait, you might be saying to yourself, I knew there were going to be smartphones able to run Google’s VR interface, just as there were for Google’s Cardboard. But what’s all this business about “headsets”? We believe we may have an answer for that. Not necessarily made by Google this time around, but quite possibly in the future. Non-mobile solutions could also be in the works – it wouldn’t be entirely out of the realm of likelihood that Google would bridge their relationship with HTC to run Daydream on the HTC Vive – though that’d get cumbersome, perhaps needlessly. Google’s VR SDK also has support for asynchronous reprojection, high fidelity spatialized audio, and interactions using the Daydream controller. The controller looks extremely similar to that of the controller which comes with the Oculus Rift – tiny, pill-shaped, ready to be made with a smartphone. See our Daydream Kit first-impressions for more information on the controller specifically. And stick around for Google’s own October 4th event. There we expect that Google will fulfill the Android promise, at last!

 Google just pumped a bunch of money into Airbnb Avery Hartmans Sep. 22, 2016, 4:56 PM 16,192 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hear from Airbnb's Co-Founder and CTO, Nathan Blecharczyk, at Business Insider's IGNITION: Future Of Digital this December in New York City.  Tickets On Sale Now »   Kimberly White/Getty Images Airbnb just got a big cash infusion — and Google is one of its big investors. According to a new financial filing, the company has raised $555 million at a $30 billion valuation, part of a desired $850 million round that it filed to raise last month. Google Capital and Technology Crossover Ventures led the deal, Business Insider has confirmed, after an earlier The Wall Street Journal report. A person close to the company confirmed that Airbnb plans to file a Form D with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday with details of the raise, and that the round has not closed yet. Airbnb still plans to raise the total $850 million, the person said. Google Capital is part of Alphabet, Google's parent holding company. It invests in late-stage startups primarily for financial gains, but puts an emphasis on brokering connections with Google. It's led by David Lawee, who used to run mergers and acquisitions for the search giant. It's different from GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), which invests in early-stage startups and functions more like a traditional VC. The Journal also reported that Airbnb employees were able to sell some of their shares as part of the deal. That's important for employee retention: As companies like Airbnb stay private for longer than venture-funded tech companies in past eras, employees have fewer options to turn their stock options into usable cash. Deals like this provide much-needed liquidity for those employees. The company's current valuation makes it the second most valuable US startup behind Uber, which investors have valued at around $68 billion. The home-sharing company has been experimenting with new business areas. Last month, it launched a "community center" in Japan that functions like a hotel — it will allow tourists to rent rooms — and it's experimenting with ways to provide more guidance to customers when they're planning trips; for instance, a feature called Experiences would pay locals to conduct tours of particular sights. Airbnb is also facing legal fights, which could get expensive. In New York, the state Senate passed a bill that would prevent people from advertising short-term rentals, which would basically make it impossible for Airbnb to operate in the state if the governor signs it into law, and the company's home city of San Francisco passed legislation holding Airbnb responsible for enforcing laws related to short-term rentals.

And in some areas, it could happen just five years from now. Advocates for autonomous vehicles have proposed a shift toward ‘driver-free zones,’ starting by banning human motorists from car-pool lanes on a 150-mile stretch of Interstate 5 between Seattle and Vancouver. Within a decade, researchers say self-driving cars could have full reign of these roads during peak hours. Scroll down for video  Autonomous cars are just beginning to edge their way onto the roads, but soon, they could replace human drivers altogether. Pictured, U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and Google Chairman Eric Schmidt ride in a Google self-driving car NEW GUIDELINES  Under a proposal, the federal transportation regulators, should be in charge of regulating self-driving cars since the vehicles are essentially controlled by software, not people, administration officials said. States have historically set the rules for licensing drivers, but when the driver becomes a computer 'we intend to occupy the field here,' Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said.  States, he said, should stick to registering the cars and dealing with questions of liability when they crash. Automakers should also be allowed to self-certify the safety of autonomous vehicles by following a 15-point checklist for safe design, development, testing and deployment, said officials who briefed reporters.  Though companies are not required to follow the guidance, as it is voluntary and does not carry the force of formal regulation, Mr Foxx said he expects compliance. Many experts now argue that autonomous technology could make the streets far safer in the future by eliminating human error, Bloomberg Technology reports. While humans can become distracted behind the wheel and drive drunk or tired, autonomous cars lack these shortcomings. ‘Long term, these vehicles will drive better than any human possibly can,’ Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia Corp told Bloomberg, noting that this technology has ‘superhuman intelligence.’ ‘We’re not there yet, but we will get there sooner than we believe.’ In a new proposal revealed this week, experts call for the integration of well-defined, driver-free zones that could do away with human drivers in congested city centers within five years. These areas would be digitally mapped and provide autonomous cars with long-range vision and 360-degree view, Kristin Schondorf, executive director of automotive transportation at EY and a former engineer at Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, told Bloomberg.

These computer-based cars could break down, and may be inadequate in poor weather. Along with this, they might not understand human gestures. Automakers should also be allowed to self-certify the safety of autonomous vehicles by following a 15-point checklist for safe design, development, testing and deployment, said officials who briefed reporters.

This recent proposal comes just as the US government has provided a glimpse at the guidelines that could soon let self-driving cars take to the streets. Officials say the use of this technology could save time, money, and lives – and the idea is even backed by President Obama. Self-driving cars ‘have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year,’ President Barack Obama wrote in an statement published by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. EXPERT: WE'RE 'NOT EVEN CLOSE' TO SELF-DRIVING CARS Herman Herman, director of Carnegie Mellon University's robotics lab, believes companies are 'technically' not ready because they still need engineers the in car - and says a true self driving service is 'not even close'. 'With autonomous cars, you see these videos from Google and Uber showing a car driving around, but people have not taken it past 80 percent,' Herman told Jordan Pearsonat Motherboard. 'It's one of those problems where it's easy to get to the first 80 per cent, but it's incredibly difficult to solve the last 20 per cent.' 'For you or me to buy a car that can drive autonomously from point A to point B—it's not even close. 'There are fundamental problems that need to be solved.' Herman stepped up as head of the lab after more than 40 of the 100 scientists, including the director, were taken to a new location by Uber to working on a fleet of driverless taxis. And, he explained, autonomous vehicles could change the lives of the elderly and disabled who are currently unable to drive. 'Safer, more accessible driving. Less congested, less polluted roads. That's what harnessing technology for good can look like,' Obama wrote. 'We have to get it right. Americans deserve to know they'll be safe today even as we develop and deploy the technologies of tomorrow.'  Read more: Robot Rides May Force Error-Prone Human Motorists Off The Road - Bloomberg Barack Obama: Self-driving, yes, but also safe | Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Share or comment on this article e-mail 162 shares Most watched News videos Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Victoria Fritz hides her baby bump moments before giving birth Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes? 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Shocking moment Kumbuka tries to smash glass at London Zoo President-elect Trump and family dine out at famous 21 Club Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Cops shoot man holding 2-year-old girl hostage Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Little girl leaps to her sister's defense during scolding EXCLUSIVE: Blow up!

Far from a new corporate campus, however, Google's space in Fruitvale will instead serve as a tech lab, an education center with input from MIT that will serve local students by teaching computer science skills. The Business Times learned of the lease from two anonymous sources, speculating that the exact location of the space will be 3301 East 12th St., Suite 101. USA Today reports via an email it obtained that the lease will house something called Code Next Lab, a Google program that's already been in pilot mode and involves the MIT Media Lab. Neither Google nor MIT spokespeople commented directly, but it appears as if the Code Next Lab will work with the Oakland Unified School District. "It's incredibly exciting to have Google's presence in the Fruitvale," Claire Shorall, manager of computer science for the Oakland Unified School District told USA Today. "This really allows us to have a meaningful experience and exposure for middle-school students that plants the seeds of college and career readiness while still being in an environment that is sponsoring joy and creativity," she added. Google, along with most of its tech cohort, has been criticized for its lack of diversity, particularly as it pertains to black and brown employees and female employees. Until now, Google has not tread in Oakland, and though streaming radio company Pandora has long called the city home, far fewer tech tenants have touched down in Oakland than in San Francisco. That's beginning to change with the entry of Uber, who last year snapped up the massive former Sears building downtown and hope to open a headquarters there next year. What kind of neighbor will such a large, wealthy company be against the backdrop of a historically diverse city that's rapidly gentrifying? That remains to be seen but is already the subject of much speculation. Recently, Salesforce donated $8.5 million to Oakland public schools to support STEM education, a move the Business Times reported last month, and others such as Apple have made more modest donations in Oakland, with that company giving 40 iPads to the East Oakland Youth Development Center not long ago.

So far, we know the HP Chromebook 11 G5, Chromebook Pixel 2015, Acer R11, and the Chromebook Flip can now run Android apps. We also know more will be added to the list including those from various OEMs like Asus, Haier, HiSense, Lenovo, Samsung, and Toshiba among others. Not all Chromebook users will be able to enjoy the Google Play store because there are still minimum requirements. However, not all devices with the Play Store can run all Android apps. There are still limits but at least most of your favorite apps can be enjoyed on your Chromebook. The latest software build brings the said feature. It’s already on the stable channel so you should have no problems getting the update. Google is doing the rollout in increments though so be patient if you don’t see it yet. Those who have the Asus Flip and Acer R11 can see the update. If you own any of the two models, simply go to your Settings page to enable the Google Play Store feature. The version bearing this feature is 53.0.2785.129. Check out the stable channel to be sure. Getting on the Stable channel means the feature is more than ready for a bigger audience. It’s not really perfect but at least you can now run some of your favorite apps and games.

The launcher brings a new look and feel compared to standard Android launchers, but as it turns out, that’s not all it will bring… While looking through the Pixel Launcher and several other Google apps, Android Police revealed two big changes that Google has in store for the homescreen. The first revolves around icons. Android has always had icons that don’t share just a single shape but can look different from app to app. Unlike other operating systems, this provides a level of variety to the homescreen. Now though it seems Google wants to take a different approach, rounded icons. These new icons all adopt the shape of a circle, some being redesigned to fit the shape, others simply resting atop it. The icons look pretty good, and the change isn’t for the worse from my point of view, but what’s more interesting is a snippet of code that has been found in some Google apps, including the recent latest version of Google Duo. In the snippet we notice references to two different icons, one the standard, the other rounded. That means that, more than likely, these apps will only use the rounded icon on the Pixel launcher and not on other launchers, at least not without some modification. This is not confirmed though, as Google could be planning to switch all of these icons over entirely, but based on the evidence we can see now, it seems these will only appear on the Pixel launcher. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Along with that, the Google Calendar icon is also adopting this new circular format but with a new dynamic icon. This allows the app’s icon to match the date in either the round or standard formats. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like third-party apps will be able to replicate this based on the method in which Google has implemented it. On another note, it appears that the Pixel Launcher is set to bring back launcher shortcuts. These were originally discovered within the second Android N developer preview and act quite a lot like that of 3D Touch on iOS. It’s unclear if this will be accessed by pressure sensitive displays, long-pressing an icon, or a gesture. Right now most Google apps support the feature, with the shortcuts from each listed below. Both launcher shortcuts and the new rounded icons both seem to target API 25, a step above the current API 24 that is found on Android 7.0. Odds are both of these will make their full debut in Android 7.1 which has been rumored to launch with the Pixel phones. There will likely be more changes with this as well, but for now, we’ll just have to wait and see what Google shows us on October 4th… Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

After gathering months of feedback, the Google VR SDK is now out of beta and allows developers to start building high-quality Daydream apps. A partnership with Unity and Unreal even lets existing engines and tools be used to create games. Version 1.0 of the updated SDK simplifies common VR development tasks and allows developers to focus on building “immersive, interactive mobile VR applications.” It supports integrated asynchronous reprojection, high fidelity spatialized audio, and interactions using the handheld Daydream controller. Developers can using existing game engines and tools thanks to a partnership with Unity and Unreal. The VR SDK includes native Daydream integration in Unity, which lets games take full advantage of optimizations in regards to VR rendering. Additionally, it adds head tracking and deep linking. Significant improvements to Unreal Engine 4 will help developers build better production-quality Daydream apps. Developers can start building Daydream apps today and can signup for the Daydream Access Program to work more closely with Google engineers. The blog post notes that Daydream-ready phones, headsets, and controllers are coming this fall, with more information coming soon. It’s more than likely Google’s viewer will be announced at their upcoming October 4 event.

This is a move back to Adobe because, before his time at Google, DeMichillie was at the creative, marketing, and document software company as a Director of Product Management between 2008 and 2012… This is according to the LinkedIn profile, and confirmed on his Twitter account where his bio reads “Cloud, Developers, Adobe, ex-Google, ex-Microsoft, Traveller, Photographer, Dog owner.” His Twitter bio link, however, is still set as cloud.google.com, and he has yet to officially mention his move publicly. His Google+ profile, perhaps unsurprisingly, is also yet to be updated. DeMichillie was on stage at Google’s GCP Next conference in San Francisco earlier this year demonstrating — among other products — Google Stackdriver, a product for monitoring cloud-powered applications running on both Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services. This was announced alongside a slew of other new Cloud Platform offerings, all under the leadership of Google’s Diane Greene, who joined Google last year. Where would you know him from? Perhaps you would recognize his face from the Google Actual Cloud Platform April fools’ joke from 2015: “One of our goals for 2016 is to show the enterprise we’re ready for them,” Greg DeMichillie said back in March of this year. This was followed in May with the announcement of integration between BigQuery and Google Sheets. “With Diane coming in, we’re on a journey to bring those worlds together,” Demichillie said at the time. He said this was the “first of many” integrations coming between Google Apps and Google Cloud Platform. Now, he’s headed back to Adobe. There he will be “creating an API platform to enable developers at ISVs and IT organizations to build applications that use Adobe’s Marketing Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Document Cloud,” according to his LinkedIn.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Google weakens Allo privacy promises 21 Sep 2016 1 Google, Privacy Post navigation Previous: Don’t plug it in! Scammers post infected USB sticks through letterboxes Next: Don’t rely on Cortana to make your emergency calls by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit When Google first announced its new messaging app, Allo, earlier this year, it sounded like a win for privacy: it would feature end-to-end encrypted chat, a la WhatsApp and Messenger, and hold onto messages only until they’d been delivered. But by the time Google launched Allo on Tuesday, one of those privacy promises had unraveled. As reported by The Verge, the version that Google rolled out yesterday will actually store all non-incognito messages by default: a clear reversal of Google’s earlier promise that messages would only be stored transiently and in non-identifiable form. Back in May, Erik Kay, director of engineering for Google’s communications products, told The Verge that chat logs wouldn’t be stored permanently. Even in the transient storage time, he said, a user’s identity wouldn’t be assigned to chat logs. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More It would have been one of those law enforcement-frustrating moves. The kind that’s stymied Brazilian courts, for example, which have thrown court order after court order at WhatsApp, repeatedly blocking the wildly popular app and even throwing Facebook Vice President Diego Dzodan into jail over refusing to hand over WhatsApp messages in a drug trafficking case. As The Verge noted, the policy change means that by default, Allo messages will be accessible to law enforcement with warrants. A Google spokeswoman confirmed the change of policy, telling the BBC that… We’ve given users transparency and control over their data in Google Allo. Our approach is simple: your chat history is saved for you until you choose to delete it. You can delete single messages or entire conversations. Google’s support page notes that users can delete any activity they’ve had with Google Assistant in Allo. But until you do, the app will hold on to your chats, your name and your interests, in order to deliver that “more personalized experience.” From the support page: You can delete any activity you’ve had with your Google Assistant in Google Allo. But keep in mind, your Google Assistant activity stores chats you’ve had with your Assistant, and remembers your name and interests for a more personalized experience. If you check out one of Google’s illustrations of how Allo works, it’s easy to see why it doesn’t want to unwrap its tentacles from users’ rich Google personae: the artificial intelligence- (AI)-powered app differentiates itself by features that are tightly wound with Google’s ecosystem, such as suggesting canned message responses. As Wired’s video demonstrates, that means recognizing that your friend sent you a photo of, for example, a butterfly, and then suggesting “smart” replies, based on analysis to detect entities in a photo in real-time: “Beautiful butterfly!” the app might suggest as a reply. Allo also includes a chat bot, @google, that integrates with the rest of Google to enable users to engage it in in-chat conversations. Instead of having to leave the app to find videos on how to make sushi, for example, you can text “@google Show me videos of making sushi,” or you might ask it for nearby sushi restaurants. The results will then be integrated with the conversation with a friend about dinner plans: no hopping in and out of the app to do a map search on nearby restaurants or relevant instructional videos. That’s going to be a “wow!” for some and a “whoa, creepy!” for others. To avoid Google hanging onto the full history of your conversations, you can use Incognito Mode, which is fully encrypted but not turned on by default. Here are Google’s instructions on how to chat in private in Incognito Mode.

The company has been slowly creeping towards that goal ever since, and this week is took a major step forward. Google Play access is now available in the default “stable channel” on Chrome OS, though it still has some limitations. The new feature is currently only available for just two Chromebook models, the Acer R11 and the Asus Chromebook Flip. Google told VentureBeat that Google Play access is coming to the 2015 Chromebook Pixel soon. The company’s also promised to add support for more devices before the end of the year. It has also teased new hardware designed specifically for running Android apps on Chrome OS. Google Play for Chrome OS is still officially in beta, and you have to manually switch it on in the Settings menu. The setup process is easy, though. Plenty of Android apps don’t exactly translate to a trackpad either, so don’t expect a seamless experience for now.

It's the first project introduced by the newly debuted Partnership For Resilience and Preparedness: a coalition of federal entities including the Interior Department, NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as tech giants including Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft.  PREP emerges from the 2014 Climate Data Initiative, which intended to pool federal climate data sources, according to the White House.   » Get the best federal technology news and ideas delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here. The new data platform will be part of a pilot program during which the administration will try to identify what data users are interested in. Users can currently explore specific data sets about topics including coastal flood hazards, precipitation and transit lines from climate.data.gov and other sources. Eventually, the site should let users build customizable dashboards visualizing that data, according to the White House.  PREP will be testing out the platform and plans to work with "at least a dozen communities by the end of 2017" to gauge their data needs. The administration, along with 13 other countries, also signed a pledge to embrace "common technical standards" and "open climate data standards," and to support open-source platforms by prioritizing "easy and timely access" to data.   “The world urgently needs to collect and harness data" to examine "trends and likelihoods in severe weather events as well as hydrologic, oceanic, and ecological impacts under a changing climate, and how they affect communities, cities, subnational jurisdictions, nations, and regions," the Joint Declaration on Harnessing the Data Revolution for Climate Resilience said. That declaration was signed by Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Kenya, the Marshall Islands, Mexico, Peru, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Amazon Web Services, Google, IBM, Microsoft and the World Bank, among other groups.  The co-signers are trying to ensure "communities and governments at all levels" can access data in a way that can help with the "management of climate variability and change.” Within PREP, agencies and companies are donating data sets and services. The Interior Department, for instance, plans to contribute parts of its Federal Geospatial Platform, which includes APIs that could help users search for specific data sets. NASA is working on ways to better catalog and visualize NASA data. AWS said it would make data sets available on its cloud for free, including data about global elevation. Google committed to hosting one petabyte of data for free by the end of 2016.  recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT Emerging Technology: The Government of the Future Has Arrived Textual Chemistry: Getting to Know Citizens Through Their Words The Inimitable Effect of Standing on Productivity The Decision-Making Science of Effective Healthcare FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

Courtesy of the Morton Arboretum   By Kelley Regan The Morton Arboretum The Morton Arboretum has joined Google and some of the world's most-loved natural history institutions to provide an online experience that allows people to virtually browse through treasured collections of natural history in one place. The Google Cultural Institute provides an interactive discovery experience of the diversity and fragility of nature at g.co/naturalhistory. The site offers a chance to browse more than 100 stories related to dinosaurs, plants, insects, minerals and the planet's evolution over billions of years. The Morton Arboretum's exhibits include its tree collections, history and focus on global tree conservation. The exhibits are: • Can You Imagine a World Without Trees? -- A virtual look at the plight of trees today, examining the critical role of arboreta in tree science and conservation. • What Is an Arboretum? -- A look at the legacy and history of the Morton Arboretum and its ongoing work to care for and conserve trees. • Great Trees -- A tour of some of the Morton Arboretum's most iconic and rare tree species in its collections. As part of the virtual exhibit, panoramic Google Street View imagery gives people a backstage pass to explore the arboretum 24/7, including Street View of select trails and roads. "Through nearly a century of tree-focused research, educational programs, exhibits and outreach, the Morton Arboretum has inspired visitors and supporters to help create a greener, healthier, more beautiful world," said Carissa Dougherty, head of knowledge management at the Morton Arboretum. "But the issues surrounding trees today, from climate change to pest issues to disease, extend far beyond the arboretum's borders -- they impact everyone on this planet. "Today, we're proud to partner with the Google Cultural Institute to not only enable anyone with access to a device to take a virtual tour of our trails, but to also be inspired by the impactful stories about the legacy and work of the arboretum, to care and conserve trees for the benefit of all." The Google Cultural Institute works together with more than 1,000 organizations to put the world's cultural treasures at the fingertips of internet users and is building tools that allow the cultural sector to share more of its diverse heritage online. For this exhibition, natural history institutions from 15 countries created more than 100 interactive stories, sharing a total of 300,000 photos, videos and other documents online in collaboration with Google. The exhibitions on the Google Cultural Institute are open for all, for free on the Web and through the new Google Arts and Culture mobile app on iOS and Android. Visitors can watch all of the 360-degree videos on YouTube.

Allo, an app which Google claims has privacy in mind, keeps all messages indefinitely until they are manually deleted. While that may not matter to some, there are others who aren’t comfortable with their correspondence being saved forever. The reported reason behind Google’s decision to have Allo store messages permanently has to do with the Smart Reply function. It is thought that the technology will work better if it has a longer backlog of conversation history to draw from. Allo’s approach to storing messages actually sets it apart from its competitors. While other messaging apps have privacy functions turned on by default, Allo is instead trasparent about the fact that it’s storing your messages from day one. Users will have full control over how long the data stays on Google servers, with the option to delete entire conversations or just single messages. As another option, people can use Incognito Mode, which offers end-to-end encryption. Over time we’ll see if the trade off of privacy is worth having Smart Reply being able to accurately predict what you’re going to say next.

Edward Snowden, considered one of the world’s foremost experts on privacy, says the new app “records every message you ever send and makes it available to police upon request.”  (Alkis Konstantinidis/REUTERS)   By Megan DolskiStaff Reporter. Thu., Sept. 22, 2016 For those wanting to give Google’s newly launched chatting app, Allo, a try, Edward Snowden says don’t. On Wednesday NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden posted a series of tweets in which he called the app, “Google Surveillance.” “That’s #Allo. Don’t use Allo,” he said. Snowden, now considered one of the world’s foremost experts on privacy, says the new app “records every message you ever send and makes it available to police upon request.” Allo, the instant messaging “smart” app launched Wednesday by Google offers its users the option of sending end-to-end encrypted messages — a feature where only the users can see the messages, and which is increasingly common for instant messaging apps – but that isn’t activated by the app automatically. Article Continued Below When using Allo, users who want the added security have to choose to chat in “incognito” mode, something Google says you can do “when you need to.” Otherwise, messages sent back and forth with the app will be encrypted between it and Google – meaning the company has access to what is said in those conversations. Apps such as iMessage and Whatsapp offer end-to-end encryption of messages automatically. “By default, it (Allo) is less safe than @WhatsApp, which makes dangerous for non-experts,” Snowden tweeted. Snowden recommends using Tor and Signal. Some law enforcement officials, such as FBI Director James Comey, have cautioned that the rise of end-to-end encryption could help criminals and terrorists “go dark” since companies can’t access the content of the encrypted communications even when faced with a warrant. Freedom advocates and tech experts, though, have generally praised the rise of secure encryption for consumers: seeing it as progress for their privacy and cyber safety. Other features of the Allo app let Google join into conversations: piping in with restaurant suggestions and weather updates nearby. The idea is to keep the users inside the app, instead of requiring them to go back and forth in and out of it when planning things like what to watch and where to eat. The new app also lets its users chat in different sizes of text to emphasize some messages over others and provides suggested responses based on what it knows of users’ personality and tone. -- With files from AP and Washington Post Read more about: Edward Snowden, Google The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Early intervention and behavioral therapy are key, but the number of therapists is not keeping up with the increase in diagnosis, so many parents are waiting months for much needed help for their children. This is what motivated a team at Stanford University's Wall Lab to create a therapy device for children with autism that could be used at home. The technology, called the Autism Glass Project, uses facial recognition software and runs on Google Glass. It can read facial expressions and gives the user cues as to what emotion they are seeing. Catalin Voss, founder of the Autism Glass Project, said that typical behavioral therapy teaches children emotions by using flashcards. "But that doesn't always translate to real-life situations," he said. "Our idea was to try to build a more holistic aid that enables the user to recognize social cues when they actually need to receive those cues right then and there." Jeniece Pettitt | CNBC Ronny Yang says the Autism Glass Project has helped her son understand emotions. Google donated 35 Google Glass headsets to Stanford for the project, but because it has discontinued production of the hardware, it is not clear if the company will continue to support the project. Voss said the software could work on any augmented reality hardware. The project has been in development for two years, and has been tested on more than 100 children with autism. The group recently gave the device to 24 families for in-home trials. Ronny Yang from Saratoga, California, said she saw drastic improvements in her 16-year-old autistic son, Justin, after two months of practicing with the device. Justin would wear the device each day for short sessions where he would interact with family members face to face — talking and playing games. The program runs on a smartphone, which records the sessions. When the device's camera detects an emotion such as happiness or sadness, Justin sees a color or a corresponding emoji flash on the glass display indicating which emotion he is seeing. Yang said she watched Justin improve each day of the trial and he now makes more eye contact than ever before. Justin has also gotten better at verbalizing what emotion he is feeling, whereas in the past, he would often just have a tantrum. At the moment, the device needs to be programmed to read a specific person's face, but the team at Stanford is working toward broadening the technology so it can translate everyone's facial expressions. Yang said she would like to see the technology improve so Justin could wear the device out in public as that is where he is often most confused by the others around him. The Autism Glass team's goal is to release the technology as a reimbursable medical product as early as next year. "The goal is to make something that can reach families at large in areas where wait times for behavioral therapists are 36 months," Voss said. The next step for the team is to continue clinical trials to prove that the technology works. A randomized control trial of 50 participants will begin this fall. Voss said the feedback from the families who have used the device so far has been very promising.

When it decided to cache all email images on its servers, marketers running emails with dynamic content that “refreshes” found themselves out of luck. Along the same lines, look at Facebook's recent announcement that it will give posts from users’ friends and family priority over those from publishers.  All of this has understandably left marketers nervous about being cut off from their own audiences at the whim of a search giant or social network.  Pat Cassidy, director of digital at New Balance recently said, “The thing that keeps me up at night, honestly, is that clearly social is such a big deal, but it’s building houses on rented land. Any of these platforms that people have invested so heavily in can change in an instant. How do you own your message and not be tied to the commerce side of many of these platforms that could change at any second?" But there is hope. Marketers navigating the choppy seas of algorithms can adopt agile marketing to keep up with — and even stay ahead of — the rapid pace of change in social networks and search engines. 3 Ways to Survive Constant Change 1. Adopt agile methodology  Marketers need to take a page from software developers, who scrapped the traditional approach to application development which took months of planning and creating before springing the application on the market.  Agile methodology asks for rapid continuous development in short bursts rather than scheduled phases. It creates an environment of constant and rapid implementation, review and adjustment to working strategies.  By taking a page from the agile playbook, as developers did, marketers can respond quickly to customer demands and competitive threats.  Consider Mobilegeddon, Google’s 2015 announcement that it would give priority in mobile searches to mobile-friendly websites. With just a few weeks of notice, some organizations managed to take advantage of the algorithm change, while others suffered from it.  Twitter, for instance achieved 171 percent more visibility on mobile searches than on desktop following Mobilegeddon, but sites such as Kayak.com, KMart.com and Kohls.com ended up with between 30 and 40 percent less visibility on mobile compared with desktop search.  Other signs suggest that agile methodology works. CMG Partners released a survey (pdf) in which 93 percent of respondents said agile helped them “switch gears” more quickly and effectively.  2.  Seek smart partnerships  In an ever-changing digital world, smart brands recognize the strength that smart partnerships with like-minded organizations impart. Smart marketers seek partnerships with companies that can help them cross audiences and tap into a new base of customers.  As social platforms go searching for higher profits by leveraging their large user bases, they sometimes diminish a brand’s ability to reach its audience as a result. Publishers and brands should respond to this by delivering interesting, engaging content experiences on their own sites and within emerging social channels that aren’t as limiting as some of the major social networks ... yet.  High-end fashion designer Alexander Wang and mid-range clothing retailer H&M enjoyed a successful collaboration when Wang, whose deigns usually run well beyond the typical H&M price range, created a series of looks for the retailer to sell at prices its customers could afford. While not the first collaboration of its kind, it was nevertheless one of the most successful, with a long series of events and social-media promotions — Instagram being a clear favorite — leading to a massive launch event.  3. Make the most of owned data Brands need to make optimal use of the data they already have. With constant and unpredictable changes in both social media and search potentially putting distance between marketers and their customers without warning, it's more important than ever before for brands to make smart decisions based on owned data.  A sound data strategy — which includes organizing new, old, structured and unstructured data, and bringing it together with ways to clean, standardize, append, store and analyze it — enables marketers to make smart, personalized decisions with data they already have, without depending on algorithmic fluctuations.  With reliable data, brands can develop compelling content. And with the ability to analyze and draw conclusions from that data, they can serve that content to the right customers at the right time and in the right format.  The right data strategy gives marketers first-mover advantage on a new trend by effectively leveraging and targeting traditional email, print and web experiences.  Australian online clothing retailer The Iconic targeted its owned audience well with its “Shop the Show” promotion during a fashion festival in Melbourne.  The Iconic streamed the show on its website and made items in the show immediately available for purchase. With three-hour delivery in Melbourne and Sydney, customers could receive their items the same day they purchased them. The idea was a success in connecting customers with The Iconic and its website: 500 products sold within two hours of the end of the show, and the featured brand was The Iconic’s best-selling brand that week.  Roll with the Algorithmic Punches Changes in social media and search have put an end to the days of long campaigns and months of planning.  Change happens now on a constant basis, and with agile marketing, solid partnerships and a smart data strategy, marketers can not only remain successful in the face of fluctuation, but learn to take advantage of these changes and create new opportunities.  Title image by Edu Lauten About the Author Paul Mandeville brings over fifteen years of marketing application technology experience to QuickPivot, serving as QuickPivot’s Chief Product Officer and leading our efforts in product strategy, innovation, and design.

Home Comments policy Subscribe Why surveillance capitalism is every bit as bad as Stansted Airport by Maria on September 22, 2016 I love it when two ideas come together. At lunchtime, I was talking about Roger Taylor’s new book on open data, public policy and how to grab back some little part of our human agency from the maw of big data. Last night, already three hours delayed by that corporate gaslighter Ryanair, I was shuffling through the endemically slow passport queue at Stansted, soon to brave even further delayed luggage, and wondering why an airport that has just had millions spent on it is so utterly crap. This morning, as I stood in a District/Circle line caterpillar train– the ones whose lack of carriage dividers always makes me guesstimate the unimpeded range of a bomb blast (I’m cheerful, that way) – it came to me. Facebook/Google/WhatsApp are bad for consumers in just the same way Stansted is. Bear with me. I wanted to go to Girona, a city in Catalunya, to spend a few days with a group of women brought together by an old army-wife friend to do running, cycling and general fitness. All good. The only way to get there from London was with Ryanair. So already, I felt a bit let down by capitalism. Where was all the market choice and innovation to translate my myriad human desires into a competitive range of options for me to choose from and pay for? Then it turned out that Ryanair would only leave from Stansted, which I dislike, so I had to satisfice like some too-lazy-to-compare consumer or a half-arsed social democrat. So that’s the first similarity. Any colour as long as it’s black. Any social media, search or advertising platform as long as it’s Google or Facebook. (Before anyone starts, I use DuckDuckGo for search, subscribe to an actual hard copy newspaper as an alternative business model to PPC advertising, and have been on Ello for two years, making it just under two years since I’ve interacted with anyone on Ello.) By now we all know the saying, ‘if you’re not the customer, you’re the product’. If you are a passenger in Stansted Airport, you are most definitely the product. It is said the RAF calls soldiers ‘self-loading freight’. Well, I’ve been in Brize Norton and it’s a lot nicer and better run than Stansted. Passengers in Stansted are not people who have paid for a service (except of course they have paid for it, but in a disintermediated way that means the service provider doesn’t give a stuff about them). They are not even freight that needs efficient through-put. If you delay them, they will spend money, topping up those useless five euro vouchers only good for MacDonalds. What you want to do, if you run Stansted Airport, is extract every further penny you can from them. This is why once you stagger out of security with your shoes half-tied and your still belt in your hand, you have to run the gauntlet of a curving shopping mall hard-selling perfume, booze, sweets and cigarettes. Airport passengers don’t move smoothly and efficiently through an environment designed to get them where they are going. They are parried and drained at every step, softened up by shouting security people and aggressively mis-sold crap they neither want nor need. (I wrote about this years ago on CT; the main thing I wanted from a major transit hub is a shower and a clean pair of knickers. Impossible to find in most. Happily for me, my environment-destroying 1K status is long since lapsed.) But Stansted (and Cork Airport, and Gatwick), if I want celebrity-endorsed scent, I’ll walk into the shop that sells it and spritz some on for free all by myself. I do not want to be forced through a narrow, twisty pathway along with hundreds of other frazzled people inhaling gallons of parabens and parfum and whatnot other eczema and asthma-inducing substances. But because Stansted Airport has no direct relationship with me, and I have no real choice about where I fly from, I have no choice but to be shoved through a winding shopping mall before I can sprint to my gate. Sound familiar? As Tom Slee has written so perfectly, No One Makes You Shop At Walmart. No, and the illusion of choice is just that. What other similarities are there between the tech giants and Stansted Airport? Public services are under-funded, but the organisations extracting the revenues and whose business depends on them flick the costs of both provision and under-provision onto the users (or tax-payers, as they are also called.). The security line at Stansted, now moved to a nicer part of the building, is just as shouty and dysfunctional as before. Airports have to provide the technical minimum of security, or security theatre as Bruce Schneier describes its signalling aspects. But they don’t have to be either quick or efficient about it. This is why the Stansted reviews are full of missed flights caused by security delays, and people moved close to tears of useless rage by the contradictory orders barked at them by security staff (themselves on low wages and insecure contracts, because if we’ve learnt anything about the combination of Taylorism, big data and the securocracy, it’s to suck the agency and intelligence out of as many jobs as possible so those who fill them are entirely interchangeable and, let’s face it, miserable.). Finally, both Stansted and surveillance capitalism share a zealous and sometimes unfounded faith in technology. I wonder if anyone has written about the organizational psychology behind our preference for investing in technology and systems, rather than people? I think about it a lot. From firing soldiers while you’re at war but clinging on to unproven weapons systems or aircraft carriers you won’t be able to man, to retail big data’s drive to refractive surveillance and downgraded jobs, something drives large organisations to prefer concentrating capital in systems and not humans, even when it’s less effective. Answers on a postcard. But back to Stansted; if a single UK Border Agency employee failed to do her job as often as the passport-checking machines do, she would be fired for gross incompetence. Typically, a quarter of the passport machines seem out of service. And of the dozen or so working ones, a person is sent every minute to the human passport check. It took ALL the willpower I could muster to not just duck straight into that line when the opportunity suddenly presented itself. I’ve got a one in three hit-rate of the machines working for me, and yes, my passport is fully machine-readable and no, I’m apparently not on any watch-lists. (Though there is something nice about the non-EU people, especially those I’d put money on being from ‘difficult’ countries, going right into the short line for once.) Checking the Stansted reviews, it seems a thirty-minute wait in an abbatoir-does-Disney line is the norm. Gone are the days when someone who knew what they were doing took two glances to satisfy the yes/no questions of ‘does your passport look dodgy?’ and ‘do you have the legal right to enter the country?’. Data drives only the appetite for more data, so now we can’t just be let do what we are permitted to do, but must be tracked constantly while doing it, albeit by systems that are, in the wonderful British expression, ‘not fit for purpose’. So there you have it. Stansted will stay just as crap because it was designed not for passengers but for those who extract revenues from passengers. The public services attached to it will remain crap because they are under-funded, and since when have states cared about petty and inefficient citizen-borne externalities? And we will continue to whinge about the iniquities, sure in the knowledge that doing so serves a purely expressive and not instrumental purpose. There are no buttons to press – no, not even the cute happy/sad face one after security in Gatwick, which is as placebo a button as that at any pedestrian crossing in central London. There are no levers to pull; contractual, regulatory or otherwise. In the modern world of surveillance capitalism, we pick neither exit nor voice nor loyalty. They’re already picked for us. Mind you, I had a cracking time in Catalunya, for which ‘Thanks, Stansted’ and ‘Thanks, Ryanair’, too. Share this: Tweet { 64 comments } 1 P O'Neill 09.22.16 at 5:04 pm I’m still horrified, in empathy with the victim, of this particular confluence of securocracy and Ryanair that took place at Gatwick this summer. 2 BenK 09.22.16 at 5:17 pm Private jet? 3 JakeB 09.22.16 at 5:24 pm God bless you for saying all the things I’ve been feeling like saying again after travelling last week. 4 Maria 09.22.16 at 5:27 pm P, I’ve read that through and still have only the vaguest notion of what they were supposed to have done. Baffling. A family member had another airline bar them from a flight to Ireland recently because the security person didn’t write a squiggle on her boarding card as she went through, thus proving she had not just … come off one flight, stayed airside and was now boarding another. (nowhere could it be found out what might be wrong with this in any case, or where an insecurity might have entered an airside person) She couldn’t prove that, although she lives there, she had spent the afternoon in London beforehand. They insisted she must have a coffee receipt or a Tube ticket or something. Her being reasonably frugal and us living in a, you know, pretty much cashless society, she didn’t have a receipt to show she’d been out of the airport. Wasn’t allowed to fly and had to buy a new ticket. Heathrow. Unfathomable, not least that a Costa receipt could somehow be a security token. You know what? Sod it. Forget surveillance capitalism. Let’s just have daft airport stories. 5 djr 09.22.16 at 6:01 pm Stansted used to be a nice airport… Why did they put an obstacle course after security? Who does this help? How does putting the fragile bottles of perfume and spirits basically in a corridoor where people are coming through with luggage not lead to lots of breakages? On the other hand, I’m finding that my success rate on UK passport kiosks is rising. I haven’t changed my passport, I can only assume that ageing is making me look more like the photo. 6 Bob Zannelli 09.22.16 at 6:02 pm Flying is no fun, but why is capitalism being equated with airport security? Does anyone really want to get on a airplane where no one is screened? Do they not screen flyers in Sweden and Norway and other far more socialist countries? It seems to me that people with crazy religious ideas should get the credit for why Flying sucks, at least so far as security goes. Now if you want to complain why airline services sucks so bad, then I am with you. I’ll give that one to capitalism. 7 J-D 09.22.16 at 6:28 pm Bob Zannelli 09.22.16 at 6:02 pm Flying is no fun, but why is capitalism being equated with airport security? Does anyone really want to get on a airplane where no one is screened? My preference, if we must have screening, is that it be implemented as a system taken seriously, as demonstrated by staffing it with people whose treatment, training, and remuneration are taken seriously. Otherwise, what’s the point? 8 Yankee 09.22.16 at 7:14 pm As long as you realize that nobody is doing this, it’s doing itself. Demons and Powers. 9 john b 09.22.16 at 7:19 pm Stansted is one of my favourite airports and this story has done nothing to dispel that. It’s for people who are good at travelling, not amateurs and idiots. The linked story is hilarious and brilliant and I’m delighted that the fools in question were rightly punished for being bad at aviation. If you want a safe flying experience, go via BA at Heathrow and you’ll pay the advertised fare. The whole point about Ryanair is that it’s a game and that’s how the bloody thing is advertised. 10 Neville Morley 09.22.16 at 7:33 pm “Designed not for passengers but for revenue extractors”: having done Heathrow-Hamburg-Heathrow this week, YES. Perfectly straightforward experiences, and actually the sushi in Hamburg wasn’t too bad, but the complete absence of anything I’d actually want to buy (why no Leysieffer concession?) in buildings dominated by glittery commerce and too few uncomfortable chairs… 11 Phil 09.22.16 at 8:29 pm Just on fares, I did a price comparison the other year on flights to Italy, as between BA and Jet2. The price difference was insane – the headline Jet2 ticket price was something like 15-20% of the headline BA price; it looked like an absolute no-brainer. Then I went through the tortuous process of adding all the necessary ‘extras’ to the Jet2 ticket. There were many of these, and they were by no means avoidable; the one that sticks in my mind is where you could pay a fee (per person) to choose your seats, or have them allocated by Jet2… for a slightly smaller fee. The total price ended up at something like 95% of the BA price (which included all the ‘extras’) – and I would happily have paid the other 5% for the privilege of not working my way through a long series of Web pages being quietly and efficiently scalped. BA didn’t have the right combination of airports, though, so we (reluctantly) went with Jet2 anyway. 12 Trader Joe 09.22.16 at 9:30 pm As a frequent air traveler there are so many points in this piece I hardly know where to begin. Its long since been the case that all of the romance has been stripped from air travel to the point where nearly all carriers are essentially busses with wings. The only sympathy I have for TSA and the equivalent is that it couldn’t be much fun to work at a job where the entirety of the public believe you are too slow and incompetent sorta regardless of how fast you work. Pretty low morale I’d think. Still, there has to be ways to make a better experience. One observation omitted – and perhaps less true of Ryanair than some – is the blatant classism that pervades the experience. Frequent travelers in the US have TSA-Precheck and there are similar opportunities to jump the queue in most European airports as well. Likewise these same folks get preferred boarding so less of a scrum to stow their bags and then enjoy bigger seats, nicer amenity (free drinks!) and more. Yes, its true, they pay for these at far over the odds of providing these benefits but there is a 1% in travel that have lets say a somewhat different experience than the one described in the OP (to say nothing of the actual 1% who don’t necessarily fly commercial). 13 Layman 09.22.16 at 9:34 pm “Frequent travelers in the US have TSA-Precheck and there are similar opportunities to jump the queue in most European airports as well. “ Pretty much anyone can get TSA pre-check. I’ve seen kids using it. 14 Trader Joe 09.22.16 at 9:37 pm Pretty much anyone can get TSA pre-check. I’ve seen kids using it. Absolutely – Anyone with $85. 15 Sentient AI from the Future 09.22.16 at 9:45 pm Profit is to be made by moving jobs quicker than people are able to migrate. Increasing the difficulty of migration, of whatever type, seems to make bottom-line sense in that context. 16 bruce wilder 09.22.16 at 9:48 pm The crazy thing about TSA pre-check is that it rubs off on your travelling companions. So, say my travelling companion pays the fee and does the qualifying interview or whatever. She buys our tickets and voila! I am speeding thru the lines with her at JFK: 12 minutes v 45+ minutes. Sweet. But no better security rationale than confiscating shampoo and nail clippers 17 gastro george 09.22.16 at 9:52 pm It’s effectively ransom money. We devise ways of making your life hell, then offer “fast track” at a price to avoid it. Then we devise another way … 18 Tabasco 09.22.16 at 11:36 pm you have to run the gauntlet of a curving shopping mall hard-selling perfume, booze, sweets and cigarettes. This describes every airport in the developed world. 19 Moz of Yarramulla 09.23.16 at 12:51 am It’s for people who are good at travelling I agree entirely. If you’re unwilling or unable to spend most of the average income on flying, you shouldn’t fly at all. My experience, as someone who does a bit of research before flying, but only flies every year or two, is that it is very much a game. A game played by big, powerful players against each other, while the almost-irrelevant passengers are left to their own devices. Last time I flew we had to re-purchase extra baggage allowance at a greatly inflated rate when flying home, because “the system” had lost that part of our ticket purchase. Naively we had thought that printing out the tickets with a line saying “extra baggage allowance: 1 bicycle” complete with multiple barcodes, would suffice. But no, in order to prove that we’d paid the sum displayed on said ticket, we needed to have also printed a separate receipt that would have been emailed to us if we had asked. Although one call centre worker did mention that those are not always accepted… In the end having a credit card available to pay the $500-odd charge made all the difference. We flew home, with bikes, then spent a couple of hours on the phone discussing the situation with different people. We had to speak to management to get a better offer than “we will refund the original $25 fee per bicycle since you didn’t use that”. 20 Alan White 09.23.16 at 1:04 am Some ancient history to show how some things never change. I flew the most in my life during college waaaaay back in the early 70s. This was the time of the first real paranoia about hijackings, but long before people thought of using passenger jets as terrorist weapons. One repeated experience I had (4 times) was being in line to board and then yanked out to be screened and patted down in a private room. The last time this happened–at O’hare–I asked the guy frisking me why this happened to me so many times. He said “Well, I shouldn’t tell you this but you meet the FBI hijacker profile about 95%.” Though pretty much your average Caucasian by heritage, I was tall but slight, with very dark and long hair with a foo mustache, and darker skin from too much sun. So I didn’t look Caucasian–apparently not enough anyway. Sheesh. 21 cassander 09.23.16 at 1:49 am > The only way to get there from London was with Ryanair. So already, I felt a bit let down by capitalism. Where was all the market choice and innovation to translate my myriad human desires into a competitive range of options for me to choose from and pay for? You chose not to take the train, correct? You rejected driving? Riding a horse? Cycling? You had a massive range of choices. >So that’s the first similarity. Any colour as long as it’s black.

Sound familiar? Again, you repeat the same fallacious argument. You did have a choice. Many choices. You chose Stansted. Stamping your feet and shouting nu-uh does not refute that. > Public services are under-funded, but the organisations extracting the revenues and whose business depends on them flick the costs of both provision and under-provision onto the users (or tax-payers, as they are also called.).

I daresay your civil servants are at least as unfireable as ours (he won his case, btw). >So there you have it. Stansted will stay just as crap because it was designed not for passengers but for those who extract revenues from passengers. The public services attached to it will remain crap because they are under-funded, and since when have states cared about petty and inefficient citizen-borne externalities? And we will continue to whinge about the iniquities, sure in the knowledge that doing so serves a purely expressive and not instrumental purpose. As we’re already established, the chief revenue extractor in the UK is the government itself. It’s also the architect of most of the actual woes you mention. And yet, you think it should have more powers and revenues. What on earth makes you think it will get better if you reward its incompetence? 22 Joshua W. Burton 09.23.16 at 3:04 am It’s effectively ransom money. We devise ways of making your life hell, then offer “fast track” at a price to avoid it. The Denver’s airport’s main concourse is a tented open space that has been sacrificed to security lines, leaving a narrow circumambulating walkway along the retail franchises around the edge. The long barrier around the central zigzag zone has been tastefully decorated with a Bayeux tapestry of weary peds (the stick figures one sees on “ped xing” signs) bearing heavy ped luggage . . . and savvy TSA-Pre or ClearMe.com peds literally stepping on the ped peasants’ heads as they sprint to the gate with their ped briefcases and designer ped purses. I think it’s insufficiently cynical to assume it’s about the $85, by the way. To bury a constitutional right, a good strategy is to convince everybody a federal judge is likely to have lunch with to waive that right voluntarily and routinely as a matter of convenience or privilege or status. 23 Faustusnotes 09.23.16 at 4:19 am My base airports are narita and Haneda and they are nothing like this. The security staff are efficient and polite, and immigration treats me well. The airport and facilities are clean, lines are usually short, and everyone aims to get everything done quickly and politely. My most recent trip I returned from Hong Kong – touched down at 8:18 pm and got onto an 8:44 train to my home suburb with time to buy a bottle of water on the way. The problem I see with this comparison is that it doesn’t account for the specific nature of uk capitalism. Business in the uk is broken from the bottom up – small, medium or large, British businesses don’t think about the customer and don’t care about investment or infrastructure. This is why cafe queues are too long (the owner would rather profit than invest in a second coffee machine and another staff member), pubs have no aircon (why waste money on such luxuries even though everything stinks?) and the banking staff don’t know how to follow basic procedures. At every level, U.K. Calitalism isn’t working. In contrast, Japanese capitalism works much better. Interestingly, Japan has a native social network system called mixi that is way way friendlier and more responsive than Facebook, with a very different feeling. It’s being eclipsed by Facebook now but for a long time it was the only game in town. It is anonymous, allows you to track your visitors, and has a blog type function for deeper and more personal engagement. Draw what conclusions you like from that … 24 dr ngo 09.23.16 at 5:05 am I am surprised to learn that Faustusnotes finds Narita pleasant and efficient, though I do not doubt his/her word on the matter. Back In The Day (20-25 years ago) we used to have to transit through Narita on our way from Hong Kong to the USA, and that transit lounge, from which no exit was permitted, was the quintessence of indifference to human comfort and convenience. Not rampant capitalism as such – access to luxury shops or even fast-food joints would have been a welcome alternative to sitting (if you could find a chair) or standing and watching judo matches, which were on every TV that was working. Nothing else. Just massive indifference to “customers,” which I took as a Japanese way of indicating, without saying it outright, that foreigners don’t matter. I was pleasantly surprised some years later when I visited actual Japan – as opposed to Narita – and found it, and the Japanese people, much nicer. 25 b9n10nt 09.23.16 at 5:06 am Cassander: given that those shops are paying fairly high rents, someone either wants or needs their crap. Or do other people’s desires not count in your worldview? Each individual shop may provide goods that shoppers want but collectively they create a common environment that passersby do not want: more crowded, more stimulating, less safe. This is a negative externality, as each shop depletes the crowd’s overall comfort and self-possession. As such, an increased airport sales tax or a higher lease rate might be instituted that would raise money for the airport to compensate for fewer retailers, thus alleviating the negative externality (and creating fewer customer choices, of course). In this respect, the issue isn’t whether other people count, but whether retailers’ and shoppers’ utility is prioritized above that of non-shoppers’. Aside: Our own experience maturing into adulthood supports the Kahnemanian notion of choosing “fast and slow”: We can act on the desires for consumer goods and services instinctively or reflectively. Public spaces can influence us toward system 1 or system 2. Market liberals’ rhetoric about “choice” neglect the possibility of different modules of choosing that are influenced by environmental stimuli. 26 faustusnotes 09.23.16 at 5:23 am Dr Ngo, I think Japanese service may have changed a lot in the last 25 years, and 25 years ago I think foreign travel for Japanese was a very different thing than it is now. So you could be right. But modern Narita is great (for an airport!). Every time I travel via Narita I make sure to be hungry enough on arrival with enough time to go to the ochatsuke restaurant in the north wing, it’s great. It’s the only airport I think I’ve ever visited that has a restaurant I’m actually interested in. Also I almost never have to take off my shoes or belt, and the security staff treat my luggage respectfully. Unbelievable! 27 ET 09.23.16 at 6:32 am “The only way to get there from London was with Ryanair.” KLM flies this route. 28 dax 09.23.16 at 8:13 am Don’t know, but Girona has a population of 100k and is a 1 hour train ride from Barcelona. How many flights from London does a town like that deserve? I want, therefore I should have…? 29 Sam Dodsworth 09.23.16 at 9:09 am Fascinated to see so many angry libertarians explaining that limited choices and poor service are a natural and desirable result of a free market and that to express dissatisfaction is a sign of naivety or entitlement. They’re probably right about the first point, but surely feedback drives innovation? 30 magari 09.23.16 at 10:49 am This may sound crazy to you, but I’d rather take the 9-10 hour train voyage London-Girona than the 4 hours it takes to fly. Not only is it a more civilized method of travel, the more people who reject flights for trains the more the pressure will be on the airports to improve on hospitality. 31 Chris Bertram 09.23.16 at 10:56 am Dax is being very impolite, but as there are flights to Barcelona from London airports more pleasant than Stansted, doesn’t it make sense to fly to Barcelona and then get the train? 32 TM 09.23.16 at 11:26 am Give the faceless neoliberal EU bureaucracy a bit of credit for http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm. 33 TM 09.23.16 at 11:35 am Part of me feels a glimmer of hope when reading reports from pissed-off airline passengers – hope that demand for this shitty product airline travel, which nobody seems to like any more, will finally start decreasing. Maybe incompetent and/or underfunded security screeners will save the world that way. Gotta think positive. 34 dax 09.23.16 at 11:39 am “doesn’t it make sense to fly to Barcelona and then get the train?” That wasn’t actually my point, because I don’t know whether Maria wants to go to the Girona centre or to a point near-by. Flying to Barcelona and taking the train to Girona centre means getting from the airport to the Barcelona city centre, and then taking the train. That adds 2-3 hours and hassle to the journey, hassle probably equivalent to taking a flight with a change, which Maria probably wanted to avoid. My point was that there’s a city with good train service not too far away from Girona, and the number who must travel directly to Girona from London is pretty small, so the number who want to go to Girona airport must also be pretty small. You’re basically asking for direct plane service from Madrid to Oxford. Blaming the lack thereof on capitalism rather than unrealistic expectations (damn, there I’m being impolite again) seems a tad much. 35 magari 09.23.16 at 12:06 pm It’s also questionable whether flights from Gatwick or Heathrow are really that much more pleasant than Stanstead and Ryanair. When you get used to ME/Asian carriers, European ones all come off looking bad. 36 James Wimberley 09.23.16 at 12:45 pm ## 28,31: Spain wildly overinvested in regional airports in the days before the Deluge, as Kipling put it. The idea seemed to be that every province needed its own airport. Maria is lucky Girona has any flights. Castellon and Huesca (at similar distances to Valencia and Zaragoza) have IIRC none at all. There is no convenient shuttle between Barcelona and Girona airports, which would be easy enough to set up using either rail or bus. Perverse incentives you see. 37 hellblazer 09.23.16 at 1:27 pm Delurking after many years, for point of information: 2 years ago, when I needed to go there, Castellon had no passenger flights (for reasons James Wimberley indicates) but I was told earlier this year that this is no longer the case. I have no idea about frequency, reliability. I think there is probably a coach to Castellon from Malaga? Not sure. Anyway, we now return you to CT’s usual programming <goes back into bunker> 38 Trader Joe 09.23.16 at 2:16 pm @16 “The crazy thing about TSA pre-check is that it rubs off on your travelling companions.

Sweet. But no better security rationale than confiscating shampoo and nail clippers” I’m informed that this is absolutely against TSA policy (explicitly when trying to convey my own teenagers through said line by said means), but I too have seen it with regularity at a variety of airports. TM – “Part of me feels a glimmer of hope when reading reports from pissed-off airline passengers – hope that demand for this shitty product airline travel, which nobody seems to like any more, will finally start decreasing.” The thing is, when air-travel works its an absolute thing of beauty. I once had occasion to meet up with three old friends in London and we all four arrived to Heathrow from different cities within one hour of one another and shared a taxi to meet up with two others in town – on time (despite the traffic). Indeed there’s no reason a person should imagine they can have a breakfast meeting in Boston, a lunch meeting in New York and a dinner meeting in San Fran all on the same day, yet it is in fact possible if the flights are on time. 39 Stephen 09.23.16 at 3:04 pm Stansted can be tolerable if you avoid Ryanair (I have since part of the undercarriage fell off after takeoff from Dublin). But for its intolerable aspects, enjoy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAg0lUYHHFc 40 JimV 09.23.16 at 4:47 pm I used to travel by airplane to do field service at power plants a lot, mostly in the previous century. There were a few bad experiences, but 95% of the time things went smoothly. You could get to the airport a half-hour before your flight and get through the lines okay. (45 minutes was recommended and I complied, but I spent 20-30 minutes sitting in a rigid plastic chair at the gate.) My sense is that things have gotten worse and worse in this century. Not just the TSA, as terrible as it is, but the computer systems seem to glitch routinely. After one epic, 25-hour airline experience from Albany, NY to Columbia, Ohio, I decided, that’s it, no more airline travel. From then on I rented a car to drive there and back (ten hours, one way). I would like to list all the things that went wrong during that 25 hours, for catharsis, but it would take too long to write and to read. I’ll just mention the last one, okay? As I ran toward the gate of my connecting flight from Washington National to Columbia with my untied shoe-laces flapping (and unbeknownst to me, my carry-on duffel bag missing the little brown notebook of people’s names and phone numbers and other information about my contractor job, which the TSA inspectors decided to confiscate without telling me), I saw the big door to the jetway being closed and locked. It was about 6:20 AM (I had arrived at the Terminal at 4:30 AM, and my flight was scheduled for 6:15 AM. However, I then got my one break: things were behind schedule already, and the door was closing on the flight before mine. As I sat waiting for my flight, the loud speaker continued to blare its warning message every 15 minutes, that on all flights to and from Washington D.C., all passengers must remain seated for the first half-hour on leaving and the last half-hour on arriving. Eventually I boarded and the stewardess gave us the same warning and told us if that anybody did get up, she would push a big red button and our flight would be diverted to some nearby airport where we would all be interviewed by the FBI. A bit later the Captain made the same announcement. As we took off, before the plane had leveled, a lady in an aisle seat across the aisle from me removed her seat belt, got up, and began running towards the back of the plane. 41 Doug K 09.23.16 at 5:26 pm “This is why once you stagger out of security with your shoes half-tied and your still belt in your hand, you have to run the gauntlet of a curving shopping mall hard-selling perfume, booze, sweets and cigarettes. “ I had not flown internationally since 2008, so my first encounter with this was in Reykjavik airport this summer. It was an astonishingly unpleasant experience, and yes the perfume concentration did trigger an asthma attack. After surviving that we had lunch, wondering idly why there were so many PA calls for planes waiting on missing passengers. After lunch, we found out – there was another secret security and passport check to get through to the gates. There a multitude of flights scheduled in the same ten minutes generated a heaving mass of wretched people all fighting the crowd cross-currents to move toward their gates. Upon arrival in Denver we hit the passport-checking machines, which generated eight different bits of paper for our family of four. Resolving those bits of paper for admission into our country took a human passport agent nearly an hour. Ah, the romance and glamour of travel.. ‘refractive surveillance’ is an excellent term for it, had not heard that before. I am happy to see that Cathy O’Neil’s book on big data, ‘Weapons of Math Destruction’, is getting a publicity tour in the UK as well. https://mathbabe.org/ 42 Older 09.23.16 at 7:34 pm “something drives large organisations to prefer concentrating capital in systems and not humans, even when it’s less effective. Answers on a postcard.” I don’t know about other countries, but it was an eye-opener for me when I discovered that US tax structure causes employers to favor equipment over people by making “depreciation” of equipment (f0r tax purposes) a source of profit. It’s experiences like this that make me hope I will never have to travel, ever again. Every means of going long distances has some really repellent aspect. 43 Ogden Wernstrom 09.23.16 at 9:09 pm Reading CT has been better since I figured out that this is posted by some always-contrary bot account, which has no goalposts, fabricates and imposes impossible standards on others but no standards upon itself – and I think it must be trying to tell us to have fun with anything it says: You chose not to take the train, correct? You rejected driving? Riding a horse? Cycling? You had a massive range of choices. Does “rejected” include “couldn’t find an alternative that met time-, cost-, availability- or other-constraints”? Train: I like the train, and was very happy with TGV, Frecciarossa and Intercity trains last year*. We had plenty of time, though. (As a counterpoint to that, however, one leg of a 2013 trip – for nine of us, from Hannover DE to Ålborg DK – was a six-train 17-hour ordeal that made me wish we’d had the 4000+U$D for the flights. Driving: From London, to those familiar with a bit of geography outside of the USofA mainland, this appears to be unreliable as a sole mode of transport to Spain. This must have implied mixed-mode transit. Horse: YES! Where in London can I hire a one-way (or round-trip) horse that will get me to Catalán France without occupying my entire holiday enroute? Or would it be a string of horses – quarterhorses or thoroughbreds, to make good time – conveniently spaced along the way? A modern Pony Express! Of course, I don’t expect to change horses mid-Chunnel, so I will need a fresh horse as I arrive in France. (Please consider that I am heavier than the average Pony Express rider.) My wife loves horses, and she wants to spend some time in London as part of our 2019-FIFA-World-Cup trip. Assuming that hiring the horses is reasonable in cost (and that horses can be the sole mode of transport where automobiles can not), I’m really looking forward to the trip from London to France. (I am not a big fanatic for riding hosers, and very little experience in English saddles, so Rennes or Nantes is about as far as I am willing to ride from London.) Cycling: Is there a bike lane in the Chunnel? Or is this another mixed-mode? (For me, the likely need to replace an artificial joint would make cycling that distance unreasonably costly and painful. But others might enjoy this option.) Massive Range of Choices: Yes. If sillyness is not a concern, quite massive. Don’t tempt me. On the topic of commercial-travel airports, I am blessed to be near PDX (Portland, OR), but cursed to have connected, domestic-to-international or vise-versa, through EWR (Newark, NJ) three times in my life. PDX emphasizes (requires, maybe?) vendors who also have shops in Portland (other than in-airport), and I think their prices are non-jacked-up. PDX is not huge, and the bigger airports usually are the worst – but – in my limited experience – AMS (Schiphol, NL) is much more pleasant than its size would imply. A thought: I want to find data to run a regression analysis to see whether there is a correlation between cannabis legality and airport-customer satisfaction…. *The trains were good, but Hungary had some other stuff going on last September that gave us some trouble good stories to tell. 44 Nick 09.23.16 at 9:33 pm Ah, Stanstead . . . One fine day many many years ago I spent a full 20 hours pacing your passenger transit terminal, waiting for my RyanAir flight to leave for Brussels . . . a few dozen times around clockwise, then a few dozen counterclockwise, then a bowl of Irish stew in the fake horrible pub with the last of my coin . . . arrived in Brussels about 10:30 at night, turned out I no longer met the conditions for a visa-on-arrival . . . spent the night in a Brussel’s airport jail, dined on a packaged waffle the guard gave me . . . up bright and early next morning, back to Stanstead . . . went through immigration, “What’s your plan, then?” . . . “Don’t have one really, just got deported from Belgium.” . . . “Think I’m going to detail you for your own good, just come sit over there . . .” sat over there . . . “Can I have a sandwich please?” . . . pleasant security people happy to give me a sandwich, saved life . . . nearly deported back to America, but convinced them to let me buy a ticket to Thailand where my wife and home were . . . took bus to Heathrow, a civilized airport . . . purchased ticket, never been back. 45 Peter Hovde 09.25.16 at 1:54 am “Ladies and gentleman, this is the captain again. We at RyanAir know that you have extremely limited choices when it comes to air travel to many destinations, and we appreciate your more-or-less stoic acceptance of this fact. Have a pleasant stay.” 46 cassander 09.25.16 at 5:43 pm @b9n10nt >Each individual shop may provide goods that shoppers want but collectively they create a common environment that passersby do not want: more crowded, more stimulating, less safe. This is a negative externality, as each shop depletes the crowd’s overall comfort and self-possession. As such, an increased airport sales tax or a higher lease rate might be instituted that would raise money for the airport to compensate for fewer retailers, thus alleviating the negative externality (and creating fewer customer choices, of course). Only if you ignore the utility given to people who do buy things that they want. Denying people who, say, really like to eat before getting on the plane the ability to do so in favor of a calmer atmosphere also imposes negative externalities. >Market liberals’ rhetoric about “choice” neglect the possibility of different modules of choosing that are influenced by environmental stimuli. It doesn’t neglect that possibility at all. No one believes homo-economicus is real, any more than high school physics students believe in the existence of massless frictionless planes. The rhetoric of the anti-market folks does, however, usually neglect the inherent costs and problems of non-market (i.e. coercive) methods of decision making. 47 cassander 09.25.16 at 5:58 pm @Ogden Wernstrom >Does “rejected” include “couldn’t find an alternative that met time-, cost-, availability- or other-constraints”? So, in other words, Maria had choices, lots of them. All those choices came with costs, in time, money, pain in the ass, etc. And from those choices, Maria selected the one that best suited her needs, exactly the way econ 101 says? Which was precisely my point? Complaining about costs is not a meaningful argument. doing things imposes costs, full stop. If you want to say that capitalism has failed in some way, you can’t just point out those costs, you have to show that some non-capitalist system would have produced more/better choices with lower/fewer costs. Neither of you even bothered to try doing that. All you did was assert that capitalism is obviously a failure because it didn’t instantly teleport Maria to Spain and back for free. 48 b9n10nt 09.25.16 at 7:05 pm Cassander @ 44, 45: Again…my point is that, in the OPs telling, marginal crowding, unwelcome stimulation, and safety is a negative externality: those who neither buy nor sell are NOT compensated for the (marginal) losses caused by those who do. I don’t see how this point fails to take in the considerable benefit of retail, it just argues that there’s a cost that isn’t internalized (and suggests there are means to address the externality). I also want to reiterate a subtler point: at the margin, the choice to sell/buy or to abstain therefrom (is that a word? It should be!) is not abolutely autonomous or unitary. Just as the “choice”‘ to buy water can be marginally coerced by taking away access to a common well, the choice to engage in exchange made in any commons (such as an airport terminal) can be unfairly influenced by depriving people of an atmosphere that allows for “system 2” thinking ( do I really need this ?). Thus, free markets should jealously protect the “psychic” neutrality of the commons regarding the choice to trade. I welcome critique, uncertain that I haven’t made some pertinent error in my reasoning, but do put in the effort to comprehend what I have written. Extra points if you use therefrom in your reply. 49 djr 09.25.16 at 7:46 pm Yes, it’s not the existence of the shops that annoys me, just that the recent refurb at Stansted means that the route from security to the gate goes through (not past) them. 50 Gareth Wilson 09.25.16 at 7:48 pm “If you want to say that capitalism has failed in some way, you can’t just point out those costs, you have to show that some non-capitalist system would have produced more/better choices with lower/fewer costs.” It seems ironic that Maria is bitterly complaining about capitalism on a trip to Catalonia. 51 cassander 09.26.16 at 2:41 am >Again…my point is that, in the OPs telling, marginal crowding, unwelcome stimulation, and safety is a negative externality: those who neither buy nor sell are NOT compensated for the (marginal) losses caused by those who do. I agree. But imagine you prohibit sales. then it’s the buyers and sellers lose out and aren’t compensated for their lost utility. >I don’t see how this point fails to take in the considerable benefit of retail, it just argues that there’s a cost that isn’t internalized (and suggests there are means to address the externality). The point is is that prohibition of sale also imposes costs. either way, you have uncompensated externalities. >Thus, free markets should jealously protect the “psychic” neutrality of the commons regarding the choice to trade. I do not think this follows from the previous line of reasoning. First, you have the problem of determining what counts as neutral. Second, you cannot count not provisioning something as “coercion”. cool, clear water does not naturally spout out of the earth in most places. Now, if you actively prevent people from getting access to something, (e.g. confiscating their water bottles) that’s a different story, but that’s not what we’re talking about here. Third, again, you can’t beat something with nothing. even if we accept your argument that markets are not neutral, the only alternative is politics, and that’s even less neutral. 52 TM 09.26.16 at 9:19 am 46. “Complaining about costs is not a meaningful argument. doing things imposes costs, full stop. If you want to say that capitalism has failed in some way, you can’t just point out those costs, you have to show that some non-capitalist system would have produced more/better choices with lower/fewer costs. Neither of you even bothered to try doing that. All you did was assert that capitalism is obviously a failure because it didn’t instantly teleport Maria to Spain and back for free.” When he has a point, he has a point. 53 Stephen 09.26.16 at 11:45 am Three days ago I tried to draw people’s attention to the song “Cheap Flights”, by Fascinating Aida, which is relevant to the sufferings of passengers from Stansted; it’s on YouTube. For some reason, this is still stuck in the moderation queue. Maybe this will have better luck. 54 Faustusnotes 09.26.16 at 12:10 pm Come on cassander, you can engage a bit more positively with the OP than this! Especially the security theater and the way British airports force you to walk through the shops (Asian ones I have experienced don’t) and the design of the environment to force (for lack of a better word) consumption. It’s not an open question that there are ways of being capitalist that don’t require this kind of stuff – we know because not every airport does it. I read the OP as being critical of the effort to mold the psychology of travelers more than complaining that airport choice was unlimited and I think this is a valid point. Sometimes this is because of mechanics (Google search really is better than anything else imo) but sometimes we know it’s due to other tactics (eg Windows dominance of the pc market). I think Facebook is a good comparison in this regard, acting as an ostensibly free public space while trying to mold the psychology of the user towards consumption. That’s not necessarily a bad thing but rather than taking the post as an attack on the essence of capitalism why not engage with the more nuanced bits? (Also sky scanner tells me you can fly to that town from Luton, for what it’s worth) 55 b9n10nt 09.26.16 at 2:56 pm @50 I agree. But imagine you prohibit sales. then it’s the buyers and sellers lose out and aren’t compensated for their lost utility. I’m inclined to agree. But imagine (thought experiment time, yay!): What if shopping were like cigarette smoking. An overwhelming body of literature tying together neurology and psychology establish that shopping is unhealthy, though habit-forming. Unlike smoking, it’s understood to be a necessary evil. But now every decision made to influence non-shoppers to shop is understood to be a “pollution” of the commons. If you seek out an item of commerce, fine. Once in the physical or virtual “space” of a trader, fine. Then, prohibiting sales in many situations would increase utility, no? 56 Alex 09.26.16 at 3:33 pm And the owner of Stansted Airport is….the city of Manchester. 57 Maria 09.26.16 at 8:13 pm Stephen @53, sorry! Just spotted that and approved it. Ah Dax and Cassander, you are gas tickets, really. I’ll be sure to get in touch the next time I’m booking travel. 58 Maria 09.26.16 at 8:17 pm Faustus, I love this line of yours about FB “ostensibly free public space while trying to mold the psychology of the user towards consumption.” 59 Stephen 09.26.16 at 8:17 pm Maria: hoped you and others like you would like it. Why the first version went into the interminable moderation queue (shades of check-in and security?) I really don’t know, and don’t suppose I ever will. 60 cassander 09.26.16 at 11:15 pm @b9n10nt 09.26.16 at 2:56 pm >Then, prohibiting sales in many situations would increase utility, no? The word “many” is doing a lot of work in that sentence. I could equally say “prohibiting sales in many situations won’t increase utility, right?” and be just as obviously correct. Neither statement says anything about the wisdom of banning shops in airports. @faustnotes >Especially the security theater and the way British airports force you to walk through the shops I fail to see what security theater imposed by governments has to do with capitalism. In fact, I dare say that if airports or airlines were allowed to forgo the theater, people would flock to them. As for people trying to mold shoppers, what of it? do politicians not try to mold voters? We’re primates, our existence is bound up in trying to manipulate other members of the herd. again, just pointing this out isn’t an argument, you have to show that capitalism is worse than the alternatives. 61 Faustusnotes 09.27.16 at 1:17 am Ido t know anything about the airline industry but my guess is that the cheap air,ones try very hard to push down the fees they pay to airports and get some gains in that regard from regional airports. Then those airports need to find other ways to make money and fleecing innocent travelers is the way to do it. In this regard they’re probably a bit similar to Facebook, which can only make money by forcing you to watch adverts. I used to use an app called Facebook purity that killed all those ads and they absolutely hate it (for obvious reasons), and there was discussion for a while about how bad the smartphone apps would be for their business. I guess there are similarities there. But in my experience heathrow also tries to push you through the duty free shops, so there is something there about British capitalism. What British airports need is for the uk to have a culture of omiyage. You don’t need to push anyone to buy anything if social guilt forces them to buy 10kg of presents every time they travel… 62 TM 09.27.16 at 7:54 am 57: What are gas tickets? 63 Ogden Wernstrom 09.27.16 at 2:38 pm All you did was assert that capitalism is obviously a failure… See how it fabricates stuff? I forgot to point that out previously. I think I have seen this bot “complain” about humans putting words into its “mouth”. Many times. But imagine you prohibit sales. The binary style supports my contention that this is a bot. In order to respond to the pre-programmed arguments that are on-hand for this bot, it must interpret the world to fit the framework of those arguments. 64 Maria 09.27.16 at 5:20 pm TM: “You’re a gas ticket” (Which means that you are really funny.) from http://healthy-family.org/map-of-irish-sayings/ Comments on this entry are closed.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search With Google Pixel, the Android promise fulfilled, at last! Chris Burns - Sep 22, 2016 30 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit This October Google will have fulfilled the promise they’ve been making on the Android operating system for the past decade. In the year 2005, Google acquired Android. In 2011, Google acquired Motorola (then, not long after, sold everything but their patents). In 2016, Google is in a position to not only create a set of Android smartphones and control the hardware, sales, and distribution, but the software, too. Google will be panned for copying Apple’s game plan with these devices, but these devices will be exactly what consumers want, and will buy. Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai made Google’s strategy with the next generation in Android smartphones clear. Not just Android, I should say, but with Google phones. Pixel phones. A brand which won’t just be ideal for developers, like the Nexus line has been, but will be ready and willing to be real top-level contenders for top-selling smartphone, like the iPhone or Samsung’s Galaxy line. SEE ALSO: How to present a Pixel (to beat the iPhone) “You know, our overall hardware strategy, we ­have done devices like Nexus or Google Pixel, et cetera,” said Sundar Pichai at Alphabet’s Q2 2016 earnings call. “We realize a lot of computing innovations happen at the intersection of hardware and software. And as we are building ecosystems and broad platforms, we need a way to drive them forward, and so that’s the context in which we do. There are areas where we have done it very seriously, like Chromecast is a great example. You know, we now have over 30 million Chromecast devices sold. And, you know, that’s an example of where we invest deeply. And especially as newer areas emerge, like Google Home, we want our ability to put the best experience possible in front of our users and guide the ecosystem. So that’s how we think about it.” Back when the first Nexus smartphone was launched, Google released the following: “MOUNTAIN VIEW (January 5, 2010) – Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today unveiled a new way for consumers to purchase an Android mobile phone, a web store hosted by Google. The company is also launching the first phone offered through this new model, called the Nexus One, which combines the latest in hardware from HTC Corporation with the newest Android software.” Notice how the first line isn’t about the smartphone, but the online store. This bit faded back for a while as Google realized they weren’t in a position to sell devices like this on the grand scale they’d envisioned. IF YOU’LL RECALL: Google should have never promised Android updates Here in 2016, they’re in the perfect position to manufacture (with HTC’s help), release, and market their own top-level brand-name smartphones to the public. That last item is key. Google needs to make CLEAR the following: 1. This phone brand is Google’s focus – this isn’t a product they’re releasing just so developers have a device that gets updates. This is a device that gets Google’s attention the way Apple holds iPhone on high and Samsung promotes the Galaxy S. 2. Pixel is the best phone money can buy – not just the best value. Not just a device that has Google’s branding on it. This is the ideal smartphone. Not just the best Android smartphone. The best smartphone, full stop. 3. Third party accessory makers are fully onboard – Google needs to prove, early, that they’ve got a device that other companies can see a future in this device lineup. Once that second tier of dedication is clear, Pixel can be elevated as a brand into a higher realm of trust. ABOVE: Google’s current ad in Times Square. This is the IDEAL time for Google to launch a Pixel phone. A list of big (and some not so big) events have happened just recently that have not just opened the door for Google, but put out the red carpet and called in the ready-and-willing press to start snapping photos, too. 1. Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 recall. 2. iPhone 7’s launch without a headphone jack. And to a lesser extent: 3. Windows Phone’s effective death. 4. BlackBerry’s Alcatel phone. 5. LG’s best smartphone’s unknown launch date. 6. Sony’s newest phones carrier-less launch. Google’s two biggest potential threats both hit a sort-of stumble and no other smartphone brand has nearly the clout (or advertising dollars) to compete. It’s time, Google.

Skip to content Gustavo Noronha (kov) tchuf tchuf; ou seria nheco nheco fum? Menu and widgets QtWebKit is no more, what now? Driven by the technical choices of some of our early clients, QtWebKit was one of the first web engines Collabora worked on, building the initial support for NPAPI plugins and more. Since then we had kept in touch with the project from time to time when helping clients with specific issues, hardware or software integration, and particularly GStreamer-related work. With Google forking Blink off WebKit, a decision had to be made by all vendors of browsers and platform APIs based on WebKit on whether to stay or follow Google instead. After quite a bit of consideration and prototyping, the Qt team decided to take the second option and build the QtWebEngine library to replace QtWebKit. The main advantage of WebKit over Blink for engine vendors is the ability to implement custom platform support. That meant QtWebKit was able to use Qt graphics and networking APIs and other Qt technologies for all of the platform-integration needs. It also enjoyed the great flexibility of using GStreamer to implement HTML5 media. GStreamer brings hardware-acceleration capabilities, support for several media formats and the ability to expand that support without having to change the engine itself. People who are using QtWebKit because of its being Gstreamer-powered will probably be better served by switching to one of the remaining GStreamer-based ports, such as WebKitGTK+. Those who don’t care about the underlying technologies but really need or want to use Qt APIs will be better served by porting to the new QtWebEngine. It’s important to note though that QtWebEngine drops support for Android and iOS as well as several features that allowed tight integration with the Qt platform, such as DOM manipulation through the QWebElement APIs, making QObject instances available to web applications, and the ability to set the QNetworkAccessManager used for downloading resources, which allowed for fine-grained control of the requests and sharing of cookies and cache. It might also make sense to go Chromium/Blink, either by using the Chrome Content API, or switching to one its siblings (QtWebEngine included) if the goal is to make a browser which needs no integration with existing toolkits or environments. You will be limited to the formats supported by Chrome and the hardware platforms targeted by Google. Blink does not allow multiple implementations of the platform support layer, so you are stuck with what upstream decides to ship, or with a fork to maintain. It is a good alternative when Android itself is the main target. That is the technology used to build its main browser. The main advantage here is you get to follow Chrome’s fast-paced development and great support for the targeted hardware out of the box. If you need to support custom hardware or to be flexible on the kinds of media you would like to support, then WebKit still makes more sense in the long run, since that support can be maintained upstream. At Collabora we’ve dealt with several WebKit ports over the years, and still actively maintain the custom WebKit Clutter port out of tree for clients. We have also done quite a bit of work on Chromium-powered projects. Some of the decisions you have to make are not easy and we believe we can help. Not sure what to do next? If you have that on your plate, get in touch!

Google Testing Penguin In The Wild? Some Think So. Sep 22, 2016 • 8:24 am | (86) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google PageRank & Algorithm Updates Prev Story Next Story I am reluctant to write something about this because the chatter in the SEO community is all over the place. It seems like many are saying that Google is testing the new Penguin 4.0 update in the wild. Some are saying they see rankings for Penguin impacted sites jump up and down over the course of the same day. It is possible that Google might be testing Penguin 4.0 on some users but I am not sure if that is how this algorithm release can work. I suspect it can, but again, it is hard to tell. The Black Hat Forums thread on page 14 started to spike up again with people saying their sites were going up and down over the course of 24 hours. There is also some chatter about this in the ongoing WebmasterWorld thread. The tools are hit or miss, it depends on when they run and if they hit the Google Penguin test (if there is a test). For example, Mozcast has been on fire all week: But some of the other tools are steadily high or just all over the place. Here are some quotes from the threads: Right now it's just dancing around bit, but in all likelihood these small patch updates are warning sings of an impending penguin 4.0 It is my opinion that Google is probably testing a filter on those weird days, and some people are winners and other are loosers. Since our company is expecting a Penguin recovery (due to recent NSEO disavowels), and since Penguin is imminent, and since we have good days when others report bad days, this behavior is most likely Penguin testing. About a year ago, Google said Penguin was coming soon. That's about the time "Zombies" started getting reported. I am seeing many tweets from folks and I have tons and tons of emails from people asking me what is up. @rustybrick lot's of serp changes that we're seeing. Tons of bouncing all over the place.— Online Advantages (@OnlineAdMatt) September 22, 2016 Again, it is too early to tell but it wouldn't surprise me if Google is testing a Penguin refresh. Forum discussion at Black Hat Forums and WebmasterWorld. Update: As the day goes on, it seems more and more like Google is indeed testing the new Penguin update. No confirmation from Google on this. Update #2: Friday at 8am ET, Google confirmed the roll out of Google Penguin 4.0, the real time version.

My rankings are pitiful as they are. Ronnie Jones 09/22/2016 12:54 pm "I am reluctant to write something about this" C'mon Barry you know that's not true Barry Schwartz 09/22/2016 12:55 pm well, I did write it. :) But really, almost didnt. Mambo Man 09/22/2016 01:10 pm Annnnnd you shouldn't have! :p Barry Schwartz 09/22/2016 01:10 pm I did. Nick Ker 09/22/2016 01:11 pm You do find yourself in a tight spot: you are either going to look like the fabled Boy Who Cried 'Wolf', or the guy who saw the wolf coming and didn't say anything. newyorker_1 09/22/2016 01:22 pm The second can't happen. He mentioned that Penguin has not run until today so many times in so many articles that everyone will give Barry credit for detecting it. ronferer 09/22/2016 01:27 pm This video seems to confirm what i am seeing. However i think google sneaked in some other updates to drive more traffic towards adwords and away from organic. Also see also of A/B testing a serp laylouts, spacing plus ad labels including greeen and yelow Barry Schwartz 09/22/2016 01:37 pm Truth is, people ask me all the time. So this is just a status update people can go to instead of asking me on Twitter or via email. newyorker_1 09/22/2016 02:23 pm you are dealing with unreasonable people Barry, you should stop taking notice. It's like you wrote the Penguin and know when things will happen. In Matt Cutts' time this pressure made some sense because you (journalists) and we (users, visitors) all had access to the guy that was directly involved in Penguin development. Right now there is no such person and I think your influence as journalists has diminished greatly. The information from Gary or John is 2nd if not 3rd hand from real thinkers behind Penguin. And the reason you and we do not have access to 1st hand (read Matt Cutts) are the same unreasonable, desperate and frustrated people that are bothering you right now about Penguin. Mambo Man 09/22/2016 04:45 pm so do something about it. The Truth 09/22/2016 04:49 pm The disavow file does nothing! Do you really think Google trusts us to tell them which links to trust & which ones not to trust? Think about that for as second. The Truth 09/22/2016 04:52 pm It seems there are a lot more spammers in the UK than in the US. Jerry B. 09/22/2016 05:11 pm It does work... well, it did until 2 years ago anyway (for Penguin). The disavow file does cause Google to not count at least some of the links in it, but that doesn't change how penguin deals with the site until the next update... if there is one. So it is working in the sense that any value the links had is gone, so you may even see a negative effect from it if links which are really OK are disavowed. It is possible to do more harm than good by disavowing the wrong links. I think it was Cyrus from Moz who demonstrated that by disavowing all links to his site a while ago. Disavow tool also does work for unnatural links manual actions, though some removal is usually needed. Nick Ker 09/22/2016 05:20 pm Actually it does do something. It was intended to be that second chance a lot of people were looking for after Penguin. But since it doesn't mean much until Penguin runs again, it isn't going to look like it does anything until that happens. I've done it for quite a few Penguin hit sites, but since there has been no penguin for nearly 2 years, it may as well not work at all. You can test it yourself by disavowing some good links and watching for the rankings to drop as a result. Don't blame me if un-disavowing them doesn't work to restore your previous status though. Larry Madill 09/22/2016 06:11 pm Since whatever rolled out around Labor Day all of my sites seem to behave in ways that are just well ... weird. SERPS are up and down daily, traffic bounces all over the place on days when search results are stable, conversions are more erratic than they were in August (not bad, necessarily but just all over the place in a less predictable pattern). Kind of hard to not believe its a prelude to a major algo like Penguin... John Thomas 09/22/2016 06:37 pm Hey Jerry, little cunt, I told you it was Penguin being tested. You weak, ineffective know-nothing SEO, worshipping Google. Sad! Jerry B. 09/22/2016 06:44 pm The confirmation of a Penguin update as of right now (2:30pm EST), stating that the fluctuation two weeks ago was Penguin is where exactly, numbskull? If my comment from that long ago still has you that upset, get some counseling or a large amount of cannabis. John Thomas 09/22/2016 06:46 pm You got shlonged bud, they've been testing Penguin for at least 8 months in various European countries, I've watched it happen on and off for that long. I told you little Jerry, next time listen to the big boys. Jerry B. 09/22/2016 06:52 pm If you had a clue, you'd recall that I mocked you for claiming that the only update Google tests is penguin. Nothing more. But since you are now insisting that more chatter = official confirmation, I'll play along and let you continue making a fool of yourself. Where is that confirmation, silly boy? John Thomas 09/22/2016 06:53 pm If you think I rank hyper-competitive markets and believe that Google "only tests Penguin," you're an absolute dolt. I just happen to know what Penguin looks like and when it's being tested because I control thousands of domains in competitive markets. Maybe you should re-read the last bout we had little Jerry, because you're confused. Jerry B. 09/22/2016 07:01 pm I don't think you rank anything. You did actually say "They don't test any other algorithm for 5+ months before rolling out except Penguin" as if Google never tests anything else, and then ranted about how the fluctuation abdolutely must have been penguin. ...and you still have no confirmation of that. John Thomas 09/22/2016 07:09 pm Again, your claim that I think they "only test Penguin" is utter nonsense and not what I meant at all. I said only Penguin causes sites to drop -90, and others to increase +70. Only Penguin shows those dramatic results when being tested. If I'm wrong, name another algoithm that drops link-spammed sites -90, Jerry. Let's hear it. In regards to "I don't rank anything," well, again, you're an absolute dolt. I've been ranking hyper-competitive markets for 8 years, likely before you even knew what SEO meant. Jerry B. 09/22/2016 07:13 pm Ooh I am sure everyone is so impressed. I quoted your exact words, dum-dum. It's a shame you aren't man enough to own your mistakes. Today, you show up acting as if Penguin has been confirmed as if that would make you any less of a fool. Nathan 09/22/2016 07:18 pm "...name another algoithm that drops link-spammed sites -90" Did that happen to you? I haven't heard of that happening during all this fluctuation. Maybe it is just your sites. Nobody at Google is saying anything of course. Nobody else is saying it is Penguin either, except for you. Why are you so certain this is penguin and not some core or "quality" update? John Thomas 09/22/2016 07:20 pm You actually didn't quote my own words at all. You created a narrative using words I never said. I said only Penguin drops link-spammed sites -90, and you said I was wrong. You're a dopey beta, stick to the weak markets kid, it's where you belong. The Truth 09/22/2016 07:22 pm You would think that with 1,000's of SEO's using the disavow file over the past 2 years, we would have some kind of conclusive evidence of how it works. Instead we really have no evidence that it does or does not work. We just have Cyrus' website, the only example that people trust. Jerry B. 09/22/2016 07:22 pm I cut & pasted your exact words from here: https://disqus.com/home/discussion/seroundtable/even_google_algorithm_ranking_update_chatter/#comment-2892349559 The Truth 09/22/2016 07:23 pm Sorry, it's been 4 years not 2 years. 4 years and no real proof that it does or does not work. John Thomas 09/22/2016 07:27 pm I watch SERPS in the most competitive markets on the Internet, and yes, sites are FLUCTUATING, -90, +70, -60, +80. This is called Penguin being tested on some DC's but not others. Cesar Bielich 09/22/2016 07:27 pm Same here mine are jumping all around John Thomas 09/22/2016 07:28 pm Utterly false, no where in the statement you linked did I say they only test Penguin. You must be a false-narrative creating lefty to be this stupid. Nick Ker 09/22/2016 07:30 pm There is plenty of evidence. I personally have had it work on several sites up until the last update. I'm not in the habit of publishing client data, but I have no reason to lie about it. You can also do a little research and find many explanations from Cutts, Mueller, and a lot of non-Google people that say exactly what I told you. Fred 09/22/2016 07:31 pm let it go, let it go....he ain't worth it bro..(does seem to know what he's talking about tho) Jerry B. 09/22/2016 07:32 pm Here's a picture for you showing the words I quoted. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8809cfc1a38d4ad7d289a76494450831c3a225b35d2c98778422f412274e5e3f.png John Thomas 09/22/2016 07:34 pm You dope, that's exactly what I said I said. "No other algorithm drops sites -90". Far as them not testing other algorithms for extended periods of time. Name another one Jerry. Name another algorithm that would have such a large impact that they have to test it for 5+ months in the wild before rolling out. Let's hear it big dog. Jerry B. 09/22/2016 07:34 pm Don't confuse bluster with knowledge. That's what got a lot of people to take bad advice and get hit by penguin to begin with. Jerry B. 09/22/2016 07:40 pm They test EVERYTHING, despite your claim that they don't test anything but penguin. Keep backtracking from this "They don't test any other algorithm for 5+ months before rolling out except Penguin". It's fun to watch you sputter in the face of facts. I'll leave you to your ranting for a while and check on you later. John Thomas 09/22/2016 07:44 pm Name another algorithm they tested in the wild for 5+ months before rolling out, Jerry. You can't, because it doesn't exist. Because no other algorithm has as large-scale impact as Penguin. Your platitudes don't work on me bub, I was right, you were wrong. Peace Jerry B. 09/22/2016 07:50 pm Just a few minutes ago you claimed that you weren't saying they don't test anything but penguin, but now you are saying that's what you said. You are so full of crap you can't keep your story straight. Yeah right, Google never tested panda, hummingbird, rankbrain, the core algorithm, caffeine, Florida... and none of those had a big impact. Your delusions are funny. Winston 09/22/2016 07:53 pm This is what happens when you yanks let someone like Donald Trump do what he does. He has made lying acceptable as long as you can pretend you meant something else and are able to change your story several times within one conversation and wrap it in brags and boasts which are also false. John Thomas 09/22/2016 07:54 pm Again, you're either ignorant or willfully ignorant, I'd like to think the latter but I assume the former. All of the algorithms you mentioned are peanuts compared to Penguin. Google doesn't need to test them in the wild for 5+ months, because they usually work as intended. Penguin is the only algorithm that drops sites -90, hence why they have to test it for extended periods of time. Nathan 09/22/2016 07:56 pm "All of the algorithms you mentioned are peanuts compared to Penguin" OK now I know you are just trying to be funny. Panda was peanuts, really? John Thomas 09/22/2016 07:57 pm Panda (all versions at most) dropped my spam sites -7, I consider that peanuts compared to Penguin, which dropped my spam sites -90 overnight. Nathan 09/22/2016 08:00 pm Hundreds of Panda victims would beg to differ. Sounds like you just don't know what you are doing. Nobody else is seeing -90 drops right now. You must have screwed the pooch badly this time and got some manual actions. Winston 09/22/2016 08:02 pm Speak English, please. I don't understand inbred gibberish. Jerry B. 09/22/2016 08:05 pm A little frustrated about the failure of your spam empire? Maybe you should try doing something useful some day. Jerry B. 09/22/2016 08:08 pm "Thousands" of spam sites getting knocked out and he thinks that qualifies him to have a sensible opinion about anything. It would be hilarious if it wasn't so pathetic. John Thomas 09/22/2016 08:08 pm "Lyke omg literally inbred, John olives told me Drumpf was raycist! Xenophobe! Bigot! Lyke omggg gib mi dat free or you're rayyyycist!!!" You sounded so retarded, ignorant ass degenerate snowflake lefty. Lou S. 09/22/2016 08:10 pm We have people that scrape our site, then post thousands of our pages on daycare wordpress websites which they hacked. This causes us to have 300,000-600,000 bogus links to our site. These must be disavowed if for no other reason that to make sure we are doing our due diligence. The Truth 09/22/2016 08:11 pm Usually the people that swear that it works are trying to sell those services. It's almost as bad as the people selling PBN links in BHW. Just look at Bruce Clay, they sell it, they promise their clients it works, but when he spoke to Gary IIIyes he had to ask him if this was ever going to pay off. Even the so called experts have no clue. The Truth 09/22/2016 08:14 pm I was hit by 10,000 bad directory links a fews ago. Some actually contact me asking for $5 a link to remove them. I never disavowed them, it's not my job Google has to figure it out. It never affected my rankings. Nick Ker 09/22/2016 08:19 pm He asked that because he wanted to know if there would be another update. It won't work for Penguin without that update (unless they change the way Penguin works instead of making you wait for an update). That's what I have been trying to get you to understand. The Truth 09/22/2016 08:21 pm So how do you know that it's the disavow file that is causing the recovery? It could be a number of different things that Google changed in the update. There is no proof. Nick Ker 09/22/2016 08:22 pm That type of thing won't hurt your rankings unless you've already been spamming for a while. Speaking from experience. I had (still have, really) a multi-year ongoing neg SEO attack on my site that made no difference in rankings or traffic. At first I disavowed regularly, but now I only bother with disavowing the bogus links when I have spare time just in case. Either the disavow file worked to prevent any problem, or negative SEO doesn't work. Nick Ker 09/22/2016 08:28 pm On some of the sites, there was virtually nothing that changed other than the disavowed links. When that happens on several sites, that's as close to proof as you can get without a signed letter from Matt Cutts or something. See my other reply to you about negative SEO and disavowing for another anecdote. I can tell you have no interest in learning anything and just want to bitch about things, so have at it. I am done trying to talk sense to you. Donald 09/22/2016 08:40 pm You said it, then deleted it. I saw it. Stop this childish nonsense. John Thomas 09/22/2016 09:55 pm sorry people for all my bullsh&it comments. I dont have a clue about seo but I am lonely and have nothing else to do other than post on this website. Shaun M. 09/22/2016 10:14 pm seeing the same since the Labor Day updates, lots of movement but things seem to always end up about the same as they were before. Michael Price 09/22/2016 10:19 pm I hope penguin comes soon so we can start with the next one. There will be a huge kick off over penguin not being right...let's hope the lengthy time between releases is to ensure its right John Thomas 09/22/2016 10:35 pm Nice try bud, I know you're salty, but calm down. The Truth 09/23/2016 01:25 am I do want to learn, but after doing this for ten years I have some serious doubts about the disavow tool. I saw 2 sites that looked liked they had a recovery 3 years ago, but nothing close to that since. I also do not deal with a lot sites that have garbage link profiles. Michael Martinez 09/23/2016 02:53 am "to make sure we are doing our due diligence" ... that's a lot of busy work. Mandy 09/23/2016 06:18 am Same thing i am facing from last week after 18 September...We are providing services related to design, development and seo also... but from last 4 days we are seeing unnatural fluctuation in ranking.... before update our ranking was around 3rd and 4th page for iphone, android but suddenly we are out of 100.... we are checking ranking 2 times in day after mozcast showing high temperature.... but we are surprised that sometimes it shows under 4th page in evening and sometimes it shows out of 100... don't know when will this fluctuation stop..... The Hau 09/23/2016 07:43 am My site has the keyword volatile times continued to occur from a few days ago. Until now it has not stopped. Jeanbelhache 09/23/2016 09:57 am I'm currently updating my disavow file, but on which website you rely to analyze the trust ? For example, majestic, semrush, ahrefs don't return the same values at all... which one is the most reliable ? BushyTop 09/23/2016 10:11 am Disavow files work at anytime, not just when Penguin runs. Try disavowing all of you referral domains, see what happens... steve 09/23/2016 11:14 am I tried it on a site which was never penguin hit since it was to new. It got spammed with a ton of backlinks and went way down in serps. I used the disavow and it went back up in serps even higher than it had been before. Until this last update. Ben Smith 09/23/2016 11:16 am Problem is, it will never be right! bbh 09/23/2016 11:28 am Dont see any thing all i see is Google talking about is next spy app called google allo David Hart 09/23/2016 11:54 am Im seeing ranks fall out of top 100 from #5 then back to top 5 then out again and so on. This has been happening for the last 7-10 days JimmiesRustled 09/23/2016 11:57 am Woah, someone get this guy some carbamazepine. Barry Schwartz 09/23/2016 12:03 pm It is official, Google launched the real time Penguin 4.0 version https://www.seroundtable.com/google-penguin-4-live-22737.html Digipeak 09/23/2016 12:10 pm Damn. Digipeak 09/23/2016 12:11 pm Same here, got a client jump 412 positions in two days?! vipinnayar 09/23/2016 12:23 pm One of my client http://toursinindia.in/ ranking has gone down all first page keywords has move to 3rd page. it is so frustrating :( Digipeak 09/23/2016 12:25 pm Its insane?! David Hart 09/23/2016 12:48 pm Thanks for the heads up. Guess it explains all the eratic behaviour of our ranks.

Google has long stood behind its social network and is now looking to bring it — in an officially supported capacity — to the enterprise market. Starting today, Google+ is a “core” service packaged alongside other officially supported Google Apps for Work services… When companies use Apps for Work with their own domain, they are given more technical support than regular customers who use Google’s services for free. At the same time, though, not all of Google’s services and applications are officially supported under the paid program. With the social network being added to the “core” of Apps for Work, Google+ will have “the same technical support and service level commitments” as other services, Google says. Starting today, Google+ is now a core Google Apps for Work service when used within a domain, and will be included in existing Google Apps agreements for most customers. This means that Google+ will have the same technical support and service level commitments as any other core service, like Gmail or Google Drive. When companies implement Google+ on their domain, employees will be able to use the social network just like they would normally using their personal email address. Although the site will look identical, the content shared will only be accessible from others using the same Google Apps for Work domain, essentially making a private social network just for colleagues. Now, that network is supported to the same degree as other Apps for Work services.

YouTube has a staggering amount of new content added on a minute-by-minute basis (hundreds of hours), making it impossible for humans to review it all before it goes live. So automated systems do the heavy lifting, but this has lead to some content being flagged as inappropriate when it really shouldn’t be. Google’s answer to this is a global community of volunteers who help police content in return for perks. YouTube Heroes will be able to mass flag inappropriate content as well as add captions and subtitles to videos. They’ll have a direct line to YouTube staff and can share their knowledge with other YouTube users. Google will help with training by holding workshops and hero video chats, which if you pass gains you access to supertools allowing you to help filter YouTube for the masses. Heroes will be rewarded using a points system. Points are accrued by carrying out “qualifying contributions.” Earn enough points and perks are unlocked, which so far include access to new services early, testing new features first, and potentially going to a Heroes Summit. Direct access to YouTube staff is also viewed as a perk. This is a clever way for Google to get thousands of real people reviewing video content and comments every day. But it can also be viewed as Google finding a very cheap solution to its ongoing (and growing) problem of content moderation. YouTube Heroes costs the company a tiny amount and is sure to be popular. I think the perks could be improved a lot, though, and hopefully will be in the coming months. Want to be a YouTube Hero? Just head on over to the sign-up page.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google’s Paper Planes app now in the Play Store, send your stamp around the world By John Hoff - September 22, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter So the Paper Planes app that debuted at Google I/O 2016 is now available at the Google Play Store. The app allows you to virtually send out a paper plane from your phone all around the world, and people will be able to “catch” these paper planes and see where they’ve been around the world. It’s a pretty nifty app. Using available wireless technologies and network lines, the Paper Planes app will allow you to put your stamp on a piece of paper, fold it up, and send it into the ether where it flies around with thousands of other paper planes from other people around the world. Alternatively, you can give your phone a shake to “catch” one of these planes flying around, check out the stamps on the paper to see where it has been, and add your stamp on it. What it is not is practical – there’s no practical use to the app except to highlight wireless connections and network technologies and what you can do with information you throw around. It is a nice gesture from Google and Active Theory, though, and as it is an Android Experiment, it really isn’t supposed to be a practical app. Google says that it is something that brings people together through creativity. “We’re working to document creative experiments like these and make them open source so anyone can see how they are made, or get inspired to create their own,” the official blog post says. “Our hope is to encourage more developers to challenge how we interact with the devices we use every day.” SOURCE: Android DOWNLOAD: Google Play Store Story Timeline Special Android Experiments app turns smartphone into a 3D controller for VR Google announces Android Experiments I/O challenge winners Guild of Dungeoneering now on Android, experiments with pricing TAGS Android android experiments Apps Google Must Read Google Home Review: Feeling at home with Google Assistant This is the Huawei Mate 9 and its Porsche Design twin Huawei Fit hands-on: fitness tracker in smartwatch clothing Stay Connected 883,798FansLike 136,398FollowersFollow 102,861FollowersFollow 469,304FollowersFollow 59,490SubscribersSubscribe About Contact Terms of Use Privacy Policy Advertise © 2016 Android Community - Part of R3 Media LLC

By Liam Tung | September 22, 2016 -- 10:13 GMT (03:13 PDT) | Topic: Security Edward Snowden has criticized Google's new messaging app. Image: CBS News Google's Allo messaging app and its Assistant bot have finally arrived, but Allo has been slammed for reneging on a promise that it would, by default, make it more difficult to spy on. Because of the missing privacy feature, NSA-contractor-turned-whistleblower Edward Snowden's first take of Allo after yesterday's US launch is that it's just a honeypot for surveillance. "Free for download today: Google Mail, Google Maps, and Google Surveillance. That's #Allo. Don't use Allo," wrote Snowden. Free for download today: Google Mail, Google Maps, and Google Surveillance. That's #Allo. Don't use Allo. https://t.co/EdPRC0G7Py -- Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016 The latest controversy over Google app stems from an Allo product developer from Google's communications division telling The Verge in May that chats sent on the app would be "transiently" stored on its servers. But, according to The Verge, Allo developers have decided to ditch transient storage. Had Allo been designed so that chat logs vanished by default from Google's servers after a short time, they would have been difficult to access if law enforcement presented Google with a warrant. And, as Snowden pointed out, the US foreign intelligence surveillance court approved every one of the nearly 1,500 communication intercept requests made by the NSA and FBI last year. As it stands, the new product is on par with Google Hangouts and Gmail, which use HTTPS to secure transmissions between users and its servers, but is then available for Google's algorithms to use at its datacenters. Allo does support end-to-end encryption, which should make it difficult for anyone but recipient and sender to view the contents of messages; however, Google was criticized by Snowden and other privacy advocates for setting it as off by default. Allo relies on the encryption protocol used by Signal, which Snowden has vouched for as a private messaging app, but in Allo it is only active when users are in Incognito Mode. "We've given users transparency and control over their data in Google Allo. And our approach is simple -- your chat history is saved for you until you choose to delete it. You can delete single messages or entire conversations in Allo," Google said in a statement to TechCrunch. "We also provide the option to chat in Incognito mode, where messages are end-to-end encrypted and you can set a timer to automatically delete messages on your device, and the recipient's, at a set time."

Lifestyle Tech Autumnal Equinox: Google Doodle marks the start of fall in the northern hemisphere Temperatures will finally cool in most parts of the northern hemisphere Feliks Garcia New York @feliksjose Thursday 22 September 2016 15:31 BST Google Google is commemorating the changing of seasons with a new doodle signifying the autumnal equinox.  The temperature will soon cool and leaves will change in the Northern Hemisphere beginning 22 September – when the length of both day and night are equal, Google notes.  via GIPHY Google illustrates its search page with a familiar family of rocks, who welcomed the Vernal Equinox in March. The rocks watch orange leaves blow in the wind in the new doodle.  The previous equinox found the characters watching the same tree as it blossomed.  Clicking the doodle leads to the search page for “Autumnal Equinox”.  During the equinox – which comes from a Latin term that means "equal day" – the sun is aligned above the Earth's equator, giving both hemispheres and equal amount of sunlight on that day, only twice per year. Some countries in the Southern Hemisphere – Argentina, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Australia, and New Zealand – will see the same doodle used for the Vernal Equinox, as today marks the first day of spring in those areas.

Not enough personality: Google Now becomes Google Not Anymore Google is rebranding its screen-scraping data guzzler Now On Tap, as it buries the entire Now initiative under the onslaught of its multiplatform chatty “Assistant” project. Only two years ago, Now On Tap was heralded as “Android’s next killer feature” (CNet) and even “the future of Android” (ComputerWorld). But Now On Tap tiptoed across a privacy line previously thought to be sacrosanct. For decades in personal computing, what went on between you and your app was a private matter strictly between you and your local file system. But this displeased the All-Seeing Eye of Sauron Google. Men (and Elves) had forgotten that it was their purpose to provide an endless stream of personal data to the Dark Lord Google, in return for fresh and relevant weather and traffic information. Private applications were one area the All-Seeing Eye couldn’t actually see. So with Android Marshmallow 6.0. Google expanded its Now service to suck in the contents of whatever app you were running, if you held down the (real or virtual) home key. App developers found blocking the suckage was possible... it just wasn’t very easy. Now On Tap never really caught on: it required two steps to activate. Android Police reports that all references to Google Now are being erased in the latest beta of Google’s Search application. The Now cards are being superseded by Google’s Assistant, a two way replacement for the old card-based nagware, which was unveiled at Google’s I/O conference in May. The other difference with Assistant? It wants to be your imaginary friend. "One of the things that we’re working on is how to make [Google Assistant] relatable. How does the character think of itself in a way that you can relate to? What is its childhood?”, one Googler whose job is “crafting” the robot’s “personality” told a conference in May. You’re supposed to care more (and thus send more personal data to Google) if you can be tricked into imbuing the creepy robot data guzzler with human traits. Google's new Allo messaging service is really just another data funnel for Google Assistant, which is always recording in the background. Google admitted this week that when it promised back in May that it would automatically delete "transient" Allo chat logs, what it meant to say was that it would store Allo Chat logs permanently. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 40 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

SUBSCRIBE Autumnal Equinox Google doodle welcomes first day of fall in the Northern Hemisphere To mark the Autumn season, Google brought back the same artwork from its Vernal Equinox doodle earlier this year. Amy Gesenhues on September 22, 2016 at 7:40 am More Today marks the first day of autumn for the Northern Hemisphere, and Google is noting it with an animated doodle on its home page in the US and its international home pages across the Northern Hemisphere. “Today is the first day of fall, also known as the equinox — when the length of night and the day are nearly equal. It’s also the beginning of the cooler temps that will be with us until spring comes around,” writes the doodle team on Google’s Doodle blog. The animated image leads to a search for “Autumnal Equinox” and includes the usual sharing icon so that you can post the image on your social feeds. 2016 First Day of Fall Google Doodle The artwork used for the doodle — rocks surrounding a tree with falling leaves — mirrors the image used earlier this year during the Vernal Equinox. Instead of watching leaves fall, the rocks looked upon a tree as it bloomed. 2016 First Day of Spring Google Doodle Right now, a limited number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere — Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Peru — will see the same spring-themed doodle on their Google home pages today, marking the first day of spring below the equator.

According to web reports, Google will no longer market its own phones under the Nexus brand and is instead going to advertise them as Pixel-branded phones, indicating a break from the past six years of flagship Nexus devices. The Pixel is Google’s Chromebook notebook with a Retina-class display which has been selling since 2013.  A teaser video released by Google earlier this week doesn’t reveal much. Some people have said that the changing shape of the rectangle in the video might mean that a new tablet could be unveiled, too, but I don’t think that’s true. Clearly, October 4 will be about new Google-designed smartphones. The teasing campaign continues at the website madeby.google.com. Information on that website indicates that the forthcoming devices will be manufactured by Taiwanese electronics firm HTC and branded as “Made by Google.” Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai commented at the Code Conference back in June that the search firm would be “more opinionated about the design of the phones” and add “more features on top of Android on Nexus phones.” AndroidCentral said recently that the upcoming Pixel smartphones will indeed have some exclusive features on top of stock Android. Android 7.0 Nougat was released recently with little fanfare on older devices and I’m curious if the new phones will run Nougat or an unreleased build of Android. In addition to new smartphones and possibly tablets, The Associated Press learned back in the summer that Google could also release a pair of own-branded Android Wear smartwatches later this year. Google currently sells two Nexus-branded phones: the more affordable LG-built Nexus 5X and the premium Nexus 6P, manufactured by the Chinese handset maker Huawei.

The “3” in IP53 means a device will not experience damaging water ingress when upright at an angle not to exceed 60 degrees from vertical while being sprayed by relatively low-pressure (somewhere between 7-20PSI or 50 to 150kPa) water.

Rooting is also something that is heavily associated with the platform and considered as one of the benefits offered by it. However, it seems like Google is trying to tighten its hold on the process when it comes to its upcoming Pixel smartphones. According to a report by XDA Developers, the rooting methods in their current form will not able to work on the upcoming devices from Google. Google has been making it difficult for the users to root their phones with updates to its Android platform. In fact, users who are on Android 6.0 Marshmallow or later are required to perform a 'systemless root' without modifying their device's partition. To perform a 'systemless root', users were currently modifying their device's ramdisk. However, now the ramdisk is placed inside the system partition, as per the code commits found in Android 7.0 Nougat and within ROM source, XDA developers point out. This means that the system will not allow for changes to be made to the ramdisk.It is especially a surprising move by the company because Nexus phones by the search giant have been known for their flexibility and how easily they could be rooted. In fact, this was one of the reasons why they have been favourites among developers. Even though this doesn't necessarily mean that rooting will not be possible on the Pixel smartphones, it does indicate the direction in which Google is heading with its mobile platform. It seems like Google is not just changing the name of its smartphones but their entire nature. Interestingly, the Pixel smartphones are meant to be premium offerings competing with Apple's iPhone models. The pixel smartphones are expected to be unveiled at Google's event on October. Google also released an API recently for developers that allowed them to prevent rooted phones from running their applications. It will be interesting to see how the company will shape up its mobile platform going forward.

Hot50 Events Kidscreen Summit Kidscreen East Asian Animation Summit Awards Kidscreen Awards News Consumer Products From the Mag Kid Insight Kidscreened Marketing People Moves Screen Tech Events Magazine Latest Issue Magazine Archive Subscribe Contributors All Contributors Lana Castleman Jeremy Dickson Elizabeth Foster Wendy Goldman Getzler Advertise  Newsletter Thanks to VR, a new era in kids storytelling is here As PlayStationVR gets set to crank up the virtual reality market, kids content creators are crafting a new medium for storytelling in uncharted tech waters. By Jeremy Dickson September 22, 2016 For kids content writers looking for new challenges in cross-platform story production, the days of the classic, three-act narrative structure may be over. The arrival of 360-degree, interactive storytelling through virtual and augmented reality is shaking the very notion of how people respond to characters and stories to its core. Brands like HTC Vive, HoloLens and Magic Leap don’t sound unfamiliar anymore. And despite the fact that mainstream adoption of VR hasn’t happened yet, there’s no denying its massive potential for multiple industries including entertainment, education, medicine and sports, to name just a few. In fact, according to global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide revenues for the VR/AR market will skyrocket from US$5.2 billion this year to more than US$162 billion by 2020, representing an annual growth rate of 181%. How the VR market actually pans out will, of course, hinge on lower retail price-points for hardware and the development of innovative new software and applications. One emerging independent company currently at the forefront of VR technology is L.A.-based interactive character studio Motional. Founded by Pixar alum Mark Walsh, whose credits over his 18-year career include being an animation supervisor for Finding Nemo and Ratatouille, Motional is focused on creating active, emotional experiences between people and interactive characters in VR worlds. Walsh says one of the main reasons for starting the company was seeing how passive many of today’s virtual reality experiences have become. “With virtual reality right now, if you see a character walk by and you wave to them, they ignore you. It makes you feel like a high school outcast, which is bad because VR is hopefully meant to make you feel good,” he says. “I wanted to prove a theory that people would want to meet an interesting character in an amazing world.” The fruits of Walsh’s idea soon materialized with Gary the Gull (pictured), a short conversational, self-funded animated VR film starring a wisecracking yet charming seagull out to steal lunches from unsuspecting beach-goers. Using technology from Seattle-based virtual reality startup Limitless, a company run by another former Pixar man Tom Sanocki (Finding Nemo, Up), Gary the Gull lets viewers interact with its feathered protagonist through voice recognition, gestures and gaze. During a successful test at this year’s Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, Walsh says most people who came to check out the demo just wanted to laugh and try out the alternate ways of experiencing the film by answering differently to Gary. “Interestingly, there were a lot of younger men asking why they couldn’t run and jump, or shoot or strangle Gary because they’re used to playing first-person adrenaline-pumping video games,” he says. “However, women really responded to being able to create a relationship with the character, which is a different use of a video game system and a different use of VR.” Sony also responded well to the film and will be including it as part of its PSVR launch in October, a move that caught Walsh off guard. “Now that it’s a success story, and depending on how audiences react to their experience on the PS4, we are deciding whether or not to expand Gary to a longer format,” he says. Walsh hopes the VR experience will help teach empathy and social skills to kids who have become less sociable because of texting and device obsessions. “You can yell at Siri and call her all sorts of nasty names and she won’t even get angry. It’s very much like yelling at video games on the screen, but in real life we all need to learn that those behaviors aren’t acceptable,” he says. “Gary gives you the feeling of a real relationship and can also train you behaviorally on what is an appropriate way to treat somebody.” Nexus Productions’ 360-degree VR film Rain or Shine While Gary prepares to spread his wings this fall, another kid- and family-friendly interactive character will soon make its way to virtual reality, thanks to Google and UK-based Nexus Productions. Also set for an October release, Rain or Shine is a 360-degree VR film from Nexus that’s being touted as the most interactive Google Spotlight Story ever. Launched in 2013, Google Spotlight Stories is a new form of interactive, 360-degree storytelling made specifically for mobile and VR that features 3D and 2D animation, 360-degree spherical cinema-quality video, full-sphere surround sound and motion sensor-driven story options. Set on a beautiful sunny day in a square in London, Rain or Shine follows an amiable young girl named Ella who discovers, much to her frustration, that whenever she puts on her sunglasses a raincloud appears above her head and promptly soaks her. At launch, the film will be accessible via the YouTube app and Chrome or FireFox (for PCs), and it will be coupled with a new Google Cardboard headset and Android phone. Nexus executive producer Luke Ritchie says the company did its best to make Rain or Shine feel as interactive as possible. It gives viewers the ability to make choices to follow micro sub-plots, at certain points, while popping in and out of the main story, which is out of their control. “We don’t punish you for looking in the wrong direction, but at the same time, we don’t continue the story if you don’t follow Ella,” says Ritchie. For example, at one point Ella is at an ice cream truck. If the viewer decides to look in any other direction, they’ll see a bird land on the pavement. Look to the left, and they’ll see a cat. Keep looking, the user views the cat chasing the bird, which eventually flies up, over and back onto the truck. “Almost 95% of viewers follow the bird,” says Ritchie. “So we’re forever working out ideas and techniques to get viewers back to the main story.” To help sort out all the storylines, Nexus used a special script board marked by location and time. “The idea is you sort of write the linear film in your head and it almost becomes a diagonal line from the top corner of the board to the bottom corner,” he says. “Ideally, that’s the story you want to follow.” Considering the time and effort required to make VR short films, they are not cheap to produce. “You can develop apps for US$50,000 now, but if you want to develop a short film in VR it’s a big number,” says Ritchie, who also freelances as a VR analyst. He says this Christmas, however, VR companies will be pushing their devices and more people will be looking for content. “So there might be a bubble where we can actually make decent returns on short films in VR,” Ritchie posits. “I’m not going to compete with the high-end games like Portal or Valkyrie, so it seems obvious that there probably is an area where you might want to pay to feel like you’re a part of an amazing Disney short film.” Ritchie also believes it will get easier to develop less expensive VR projects because most of them are now built in game development platform Unity. And new companies like Sketch, which offers simple ways to upload design mockups to VR, are popping up. Unity, in fact, recently completed a series C investment round of US$181 million to drive the VR/AR sector. The middleware company currently boasts 5.5 million registered developers and 4.2 billion games made with its technology in Q1 2016, including the global phenomenon that is Pokémon GO. “But for high-end VR stories that require a lot of investment and thought process, in some ways, it’s never going to get easier,” adds Ritchie. Understanding how much sacrifice is required to produce a bigger VR project is something not lost on Mo Davoudian of L.A.-based Brain Zoo Studios (Pepe & Lucas). The CGI animation company’s creative director and CEO is currently nearing the end of a 22-year mission to complete Brain Zoo’s original CGI-animated short film, Nora. (It’s being produced with co-creator/designer Farzad Varahramyan, co-creator Ali Donovan and a team of film, VR and gaming vets.) Sci-fi short Nora is being developed as a VR series and film Nora, which is also being developed as a traditional TV and VR series using real-time gaming engines, provides a family-friendly mix of comedy, sci-fi and action-adventure set in a retro future, where an odd couple must team up to save their world from the brink of destruction. “The timing for the project right now is perfect because we’re seeing film and gaming technologies really come together with VR,” says Davoudian. “It started out as a short film as a proof of concept for a feature, but as time went on we saw that, while it still has great potential for a feature, it has even more potential as a series in VR.” Nora is currently in the scriptwriting and early development phase for a planned 26 x half-hour series, and Davoudian says Brain Zoo expects to maintain a level of quality and visual design not normally found in TV animation. He contends that kids are much more sophisticated today than they were five years ago. “A lot of what’s on TV still panders to the old ways of almost talking down to kids, instead of understanding that they get a lot more than we think they do,” Davoudian notes. “We’re looking for producing partners who have a vision for something greater. We’re planning for the series to be available in such a way that if a person doesn’t have the VR hardware, they won’t miss out. The VR experience will just enhance what’s there.” Looking at broader opportunities for kids and VR, Davoudian says one thing people are not currently paying a lot of attention to is YouTube’s 360-degree platform. “Kids can take advantage because they can grab their parents’ iPads or iPhones and watch the videos in VR without wearing a headset, so it doesn’t affect their development,” he says. “And the distribution is worldwide. You can reach more people much faster than you would if you needed a headset.” Like Brain Zoo, UK-based Plug-in Media, which is known for content aimed at younger kids, including CBeebies’ Tee and Mo, is also delving into Unity-driven production with its new BBC-commissioned VR animated sitcom Angie’s Party. Built for Google Cardboard, and inspired by interactive theater like Punch Drunk’s hit stage production Sleep No More, the story features 11 minutes of content embedded within five linear minutes and plays out over the title character’s 16th birthday party. Using long-stare motion tracking, viewers can choose their own storylines to follow apart from the main action, much like a Google Spotlight Story. Though targeting an older 16 to 23 audience, Plug-in also has plans to launch a VR drama for tweens. “We’ve written a proposal around bullying targeting 10- to 14-year-olds, because it’s a very interesting topic to explore in such an immersive way from so many different perspectives,” says Plug-in MD Juliet Tzabar. While opinions vary wildly on the current state and long-term outlook of the VR industry, it’s generally agreed that mobile will help bring virtual reality to the masses in a faster, more affordable way. Notably, Google’s Daydream VR launch this fall is promising a higher-quality mobile experience than Cardboard and a controller, as Daydream-compatible phones hit the market. Hulu will also have a presence on the platform, along with game companies like Ubisoft and many YouTube stars including iJustine. “For me, the biggest market will be mobile, but another thing that is coming is Google’s Tango Project, which is like the Microsoft Kinect, but in a phone,” says Ritchie. Out this September on the Lenovo Phab2 Pro superphone, Tango uses indoor mapping technology and augmented reality that lets your phone become a window into virtual worlds. “Once you put on the experience, it’s like taking a beautiful Pixar film and having all the characters in your bedroom with you,” says Ritchie. In fact, while VR revenues are expected to be greater than AR-related ones into 2017 (driven by consumer growth of games and paid content), IDC expects AR will overtake VR by 2018. Growing a content ecosystem Fans of creator Kyle A. Carrozza’s hit Cartoon Network micro-series Mighty Magiswords will get to extend their quests for swords when the Cartoon Network Anything 15-second interactive toon makes its full-length series debut on September 29. While no plans are in the works to experiment with virtual reality, Cartoon Network will launch a whopping 400 pieces of customized, platform-specific Mighty Magiswords original content in the form of shorts, vlogs, web and mobile games, and interactive narrative content in tandem with the new 11-minute linear series. The Cartoon Network Studios comedy-adventure, its first original digital show, follows the adventures of a brother-and-sister warrior duo who wield a collection of silly and sometimes magical swords in battle. Since launching on CN’s snackable content-focused micro-network, the Watch Cartoon Network video app and CartoonNetwork.com, Mighty Magiswords has given fans new ways to immerse themselves with its characters and stories. Notably, every micro-short lets kids choose between swords, with each one determining a different outcome of the narrative. For Carrozza (The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water), one of the biggest challenges has been learning to write longer Magiswords episodes. “I originally pitched a show for television, not a 15-second cartoon, but the way that it’s been produced has worked in the show’s favor,” Carrozza says. “There was definitely a little bit of trial and error when we made the 15-second episodes and the three-minute stories.” As far as coordinating so much ancillary content goes, Carrozza says he has the help of a good-sized team, but not every story gets fleshed out. “I don’t want to have an Avatar level of backstory or I’d be too precious about things. If there were times when we ran into continuity that negated itself, we generally figured out how to explain it away because I love making fun of continuity,” he says. “That said, I try to make every piece of content in a way that if it was your first experience with the IP, you could generally understand what’s going on. But if you have been tracking everything, there are rewards for paying attention.” With so many different formats and fan experiences for shows across platforms today, Carrozza says the one thing that should remain consistent is strong characters and personalities. “You can’t depend on the gimmick or the technology. VR has been on people’s lips for so many decades now and has never quite become a thing, but people also said that 3D movies were a fad and they’re still here,” he says. “I am more interested in being adaptable. I can make Mighty Magiswords content for whatever format happens to roll along.” TAGS:3D, Angie's Party, AR, Gary the Gull, Google+, Mighty Magiswords, Motional, Nexus Productions, Nora, Rain or Shine, VR, VR/AR, YouTube About The Author Jeremy is the Features Editor of Kidscreen specializing in the content production, broadcasting and distribution aspects of the global children's entertainment industry.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) or Messenger from Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB). Source: Alphabet, Inc. Alas, it falls short. On the flip side, nothing is forever, and consumers can be unpredictable. A tweak here and an adjustment there, and Allo could end up carving out some market share in what has become an amazingly crowded online-messenger space. The question is: What tweaks and adjustments need to be made for Apple and Facebook to worry, and for Alphabet shareholders to view the technology as yet another reason to buy into Google’s dominance of the web? Hello Allo Allo was actually unveiled at Google’s I/O conference in May and created an immediate buzz. The mobile-only tool includes Google Assistant as part of the conversation, answering questions and making suggestions within the context of the chat. It’s not just powered by artificial intelligence, however. The Google Assistant actually learns each user’s nuances and preferences, and improves its usefulness to users as time passes. Better yet, Allo also allows for end-to-end encryption, meaning they can’t be intercepted and interpreted by anyone other than the chat’s participants — and Google, unless the “incognito” mode is selected. In incognito mode, not even Google can decrypt messages, even if a subpoena or search warrant is presented. 8 Small-Cap Stocks With Straight-A Potential The catch? Unless a user explicitly tells Allo to encrypt and delete all conversations (a feature called “self-destruct”), it won’t. But in the incognito mode necessary to make that happen, Google Assistant — the messaging platform’s distinguishing feature — doesn’t work. For some, a lack of in-chat assistance is a small price to pay for complete privacy. For others, privacy isn’t as important as all the bells and whistles. How Allo Stacks Up Like all the other messaging platforms available, Allo has pros and cons. It’s going to struggle to break into the market, however, not so much because it’s not competitive, but because most users have already picked their platform. To that end, Facebook is the clear name to take aim at. It owns the world’s most popular chat service, WhatsApp, which boasts 1 billion users, while Facebook Messenger — the world’s second most used platform — sports 900 million users. There’s a reason for Facebook’s dominance in this aspect of the mobile market. Several reasons, actually. Facebook Messenger (along with iMessage) supports third-party features within the app. These include things like the ability to send money from one user to another within the chat window. Google has said it has no intention adding such capabilities to Allo. Facebook fans also love the fact that Messenger is device-agnostic, meaning it works the same on a computer as it does a Mac as it does any mobile device. Allo inexplicably isn’t available on a PC or Macintosh. Conversely, although it’s still less than elegant, the Google Assistant built into Allo will get better. For those who have already given up any hope of actual privacy on the web, it’s going to be a nice little add-in. Perhaps the biggest difference between Facebook’s Messenger (and WhatsApp) versus Allo — Facebook is blatantly monetizing its platforms, allowing advertisers to contact users. Google isn’t monetizing Allo, at least not directly. There’s little doubt the company is scouring non-incognito chat sessions, however, figuring out a way to present highly targeted ads on that mobile device. Bottom Line While Allo introduces some interesting ideas, it doesn’t bring any game-changers or deal-breakers to the table. The most distinguishing factor only works when users are willing to give up their privacy, and it’s worth noting Facebook offers its own messenger chat bots. Unlike Google’s AI-based utility, though, client companies are responsible for developing their own chatbots that converse with users. Facebook is just the host. With all of that being said, as interesting as Allo is, it’s not apt to get a great deal of traction. Lack of utility isn’t holding it back; some users will love the privacy it offers. It’s simply the fact that Allo users can only send messages to other Allo users. It’s unlikely that anyone will be able to convince the majority of their acquaintances to switch gears after spending months if not years getting acquainted with a different service. Being first really is more important than being best. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Whether using cloaking, unnatural paid-for links, doorway pages, spam or hidden links, Google is swift and brutal with a manual penalty. Even if the transgression isn’t necessarily your own fault. In fact for some of the following well-known brands, they’re merely guilty of not paying enough attention or not being educated enough when it comes to what Google cracks down on. There’s some great advice here about what to do when hit with a manual penalty, but for now, let’s check out the circumstances of 12 high profile cases and the damage meted out by the penalty. For more information, you can check out the full infographic and blog post from Digital Third Coast. Please note: the following ‘present-day’ traffic loss predictions were calculated using SimilarWeb’s data by Digital Third Coast. The Washington Post In October 2007, The Washington Post was caught selling links on their blog without adhering to Google’s best practice when included paid-for links. The paper’s PageRank value dropped from PR7 to PR5 and was likely restored after a couple of months. Today this penalty would lead to a potential loss of traffic of around 76.4 million. WordPress In March 2005, WordPress was penalised for the use of doorway pages. These are webpages used for spamming a search engine by creating multiple pages for specific high-value phrases but they just send visitors to the same destination. WordPress hosted 168,000 articles about high-cost advertising keywords, written by a third-party, and were penalised by Google for two days. During this period, WordPress didn’t rank for its own name and its PageRank was reduced to zero. Today this penalty would lead to a potential loss of traffic of around 10.08 million. BBC In March 2013, the BBC was penalised for unnatural links on a single page, although the details haven’t been confirmed. Rumour suggests it wasn’t the BBC’s fault, rather a RSS feed scraper. The page was downgraded by Google in rankings. Today this penalty would lead to a potential loss of traffic of around 3.52 million for one day. BMW In February 2006, BMW was caught manipulating search results for the term ‘used car’ by redirecting searchers to the regular BMW company page when they clicked through. For this, the site was completely removed from search results for three days. Today this penalty would lead to a potential loss of traffic of around 71,600. Mozilla In April 2013, Mozilla was penalised for hosting a webpage with 12mb of spam from 21,169 user comments. This isn’t Mozilla’s fault, but it’s a lesson to us all to make sure any user generated content in comment sections is cleaned up. The page was downgraded in rankings, and Mozilla ended up removing the offending page all together. Today this penalty would lead to a potential loss of traffic of around 1.25 million for one day. Genius Back when Genius was known as Rap Genius, the company was very publicly penalised by Google for asking bloggers to provide lyrics in exchange for unnatural links promotion. This led to a 10 day ban, where Rap Genius didn’t rank for its own name and suffered a drop in PageRank. Today this penalty would lead to a potential loss of traffic of around 3.8 million. eBay This one is a little mysterious, as neither eBay nor Google has confirmed the details, but in 2014 the company received a manual penalty and an unspecified drop in rankings. Today this penalty would lead to a potential loss of traffic of around 6.11 million for one day. Share this article Facebook0 Linkedin316 Google+37 Twitter 353 Related articles Five tools to help you build a content-focused SEO campaign Nine mobile trends to help you stand out in 2017 and beyond How to minimise the interaction cost of your web forms Google’s mobile-first index: how to prepare your business Overstock In February 2011, Overstock offered discounts to schools in exchange for links back to their own sire and artificially raise their rankings for specific products. This led to a two month ban on the company ranking for its own brand name. Today this penalty would lead to a potential loss of traffic of around 12.17 million. JC Penney Showing that a penalty isn’t necessarily the fault of the company, but rather an errant SEO using black hat tactics, JC Penney suffered a huge drop from the first SERP for multiple search terms thanks to ‘copious paid links’ found on unrelated sites. This lasted two months. Today this penalty would lead to a potential loss of traffic of around 12.33 million. The Home Depot In 2012, The Home Depot asked its partners to link to their site with recommended anchor text. If this wasn’t bad enough they also suggested that these links could be hidden (i.e. using white text on white background, placing text behind an image). This led to a two month drop from the first SERP for many of its product pages. Today this penalty would lead to a potential loss of traffic of around 37.13 million. But who punishers the punisher? Well it may surprise you to learn that the answer to this question is Google. Google really isn’t shy of making an example of itself, based on the following self-transgressions… Google Chrome Google was guilty of buying links to promote its own browser in January 2012. Although they claimed this was accidental, Google still penalised itself with lowered rankings for the Chrome homepage for a two month period. Google AdWords Google AdWords was found guilty of cloaking in July 2010. A spokesperson stated that, “some Google support pages were inadvertently showing different content to the Google crawler than to users.” So again, this is more of an accident, but to set an example Google still punished itself with degraded ranks for an unknown period of time.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 16, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports CTR as a ranking factor: what we know so far and how to action it SEO 22 Sep 16 | Sam Underwood Facebook0 Linkedin166 Google+19 Twitter 185 For the last two years there has been much discussion and debate around whether click through rate (CTR) is something Google uses to determine where to rank a site. It all began way back when Rand Fishkin did an interesting experiment which provided some evidence behind his theory that CTR is in fact something that could influence rankings. This theory makes sense; why wouldn’t Google be looking at user based signals to improve search results? Just as we do user testing on our websites to increase the number of conversions, Google will surely want to be looking at user signals to ensure they are fulfilling their goal of ‘organising the world’s information’ in the correct order in SERPs. Why CTR is not a ranking factor, from Google However, many times when Google, and more specifically Gary Illyses, has been questioned on this we have received the response of the opposite. That Google does not use CTR as a ranking factor due to it being a ‘noisy signal’ and something that could be gamed by spammers. See this response from Gary Illyses in an interesting interview with Kwasi Studios: We also received the same response from Gary when he mentioned the topic in June 2015 at SMX Advanced. At the event Gary did, however, say CTR is being used for personalisation, meaning search results change if you frequently click on the same site. This can be especially useful for ambiguous terms. For example, if a user searched for ‘Jaguars’ a ‘Query Deserves Diversity’ (QDD) algorithm will take effect and display results for the car brand, the Jacksonville Jaguars as well as the animal. If the user then clicks on the car brand and does that frequently, Google will be more likely to show the Jaguar car brand due to the high CTR for the Jaguar site. Other than that, Gary says click data is not being used. Why CTR is an indirect ranking factor, from Google Due to this negative feedback received from Google around the topic, some have dismissed CTR as something that Google does not make use of. However, conversely we have had other statements from Google that specify they do in fact use CTR in some circumstances. The primary evidence we have from Google that CTR is being used for more than just personalisation is in this excellent presentation by Paul Haahr titled ‘How Google Works: A Ranking Engineer’s Perspective’. If you have not watched the presentation yet, I highly recommend it! You can find a video of it here. From this video, we can gather Google is using click through rate, but not to adjust rankings directly. They are instead using it indirectly in controlled situations to validate the quality of search results. They are also using it to verify that an algorithm change has the desired results. ‘Controlled situations’ means they are taking a portion of search results, testing changes and using CTR as a metric to measure if the changes had the desired impact on improving user engagement. Following what Google has said regarding CTR, this means that it is not being used in a way to directly change search results. It is instead being used to test whether changes to direct ranking signals such as content and links are improving user engagement and the quality of search results. This is explained in this slide on Paul Haahr’s presentation: Other ways Google is measuring the quality of search results As explained in the presentation, CTR is only one of the ways Google is testing search results are showing up in the correct order. They are also taking a more manual approach with human rater experiments. This is where Google will show an actual person a search result that has an experimental algorithm change on it, and they get them to score the page based on whether the needs have been met (does the page fulfil user intent), and the quality of the page. What this means is gaming the system explained here by artificially increasing CTR becomes virtually impossible, as along with live experiments, there is a manual review of pages before algorithm changes take place. I am sure CTR and human rater experiments are only some of the ways Google will be testing algorithm changes. While this was never mentioned as a user engagement metric in the presentation, there is a high chance they are also paying attention to pogo sticking and dwell time. If this is true, it makes metrics such as average time on site and bounce rate important things to consider. Here is a bit of data sourced from our in-house ‘Roadmap’ technology that looks at over 160 potential ranking factors and shows correlations in search performance. And yes, I know correlation does not mean causation, but it can give us a good indication what Google is taking into consideration when ranking sites. Here is how average time on site correlates: Source: Stickyeyes Roadmap Of course, this does not mean Google is directly creating algorithms that change rankings based on things such as average time on site. It does, however, inform us that Google is favouring sites that searchers stay on. This metric could be used in a similar way to how Paul Haahr explains Google uses CTR, where they will adjust traditional signals such as content and links depending on whether the user stays on the site or not. Again, this is all speculation with a bit of data to back it up. Why CTR Is a direct ranking factor (sometimes), from Rand Despite what we know is 100% correct, as Google has confirmed it, we still have Rand Fishkin’s CTR experiments that say Google is not telling us everything they use click data for. This is where we have to speculate based on the information the SEO community has managed to get out of Google. Thankfully some insight into this was given by Googler Andrey Lipattsev in a Q&A show back in March 2016 when Rand questioned him on it. Here is Andrey’s response to Rand asking why exactly that happened: “Andrey: It’s hard to judge immediately, without actually looking at the data in front of me. But, in my opinion, my best guess here would be the general interest that you generate around that subject, and you generate exactly the sort of signals that we are looking out for, mentions and links and social tweets and social mentions, which are basically more links to the page, more mentions of this context. I suppose it throws us off for a while until we’re able to establish that none of that is relevant to the user intent, I suppose.” From Andrey’s response, I believe he is explaining part of Google’s algorithm that is a temporary ranking factor that identifies hot topics or searches and then adjusts rankings accordingly depending on social signals, and possibly user behaviour. We already know Google tries to push rankings up for fresh content, and this algorithm seems similar to the freshness algorithm (announced way back in 2011). When this ranking change occurs, it is more than likely that Google applies the technology they have to combat click fraud in Adwords. I believe this experiment that came to the result the CTR was not a ranking factor by using bot traffic backs this up. What we know – summarised From all of the above we can summarise what we know into the following things: Firstly, CTR does seem to have an immediate and temporary impact on rankings in some cases. This is more than likely due to an algorithm that aims to spot trending content and hot topics, and then adjusts rankings depending on which page is the most popular and seems to be fulfilling user intent. Again, this ranking change is temporary, and I imagine will be tough to try and game. It worked so well when Rand ran his experiment because he did it with actual people, not bots. In this instance, CTR is a temporary direct ranking factor. Secondly, Google is using CTR in live experiments to quality-check their results. This is not being done across all search results but in a controlled manner across a portion of different SERPs. Based upon the results, Google will then adjust other algorithms to do with links, content, etc. In this case, CTR is an indirect ranking factor. Thirdly, Google is using CTR to personalise results for individual users.

The rest of the post will be about how to identifying click through rate opportunities, and then how to improve it. Finding low CTR terms The only reliable data we have on CTR comes from Google itself in the Search Console search analytics report. To help with identifying these terms I have made this CTR Opportunity Analysis template Google sheet. This sheet finds out what the average CTR is for keywords ranking position 1 – 100 from a GSC export, and then compares each keyword against your site’s average CTR for that position. This allows you to identify if there is a significant opportunity to improve click-through for a particular query. You can see whether there is an opportunity as it will tell you in the ‘Optimise CTR’ column. If you rank higher than position ten it will simply say ‘Improve Rankings’. If you have your own data on average CTR for it each position, there is a hidden sheet called ‘CTR Ref’ where you can fill this information in. You could also replace it with data from this Moz CTR study. To find queries that that have a low click through rate do the following: Navigate to the search analytics report in GSC. Add the below filters (change country depending on your location, you may also want to add a device filter if desktop or mobile is your focus): Download the results as a CSV (bottom left of the page). Then open up the CSV and format the position column so it has 0 decimal places (this will make more sense after the next step). Make a copy of this spreadsheet by going to File > Make A Copy. Paste the corresponding columns from the Google Search Console CSV into the template. At this point, you can scrape Google for each keywords position instead of relying on GSC’s average position if you want to. Once you have this information set out like the above you can then filter the ‘Optimise CTR’ column to only show results that return a yes. Next, you can sort from high to low on impressions. The high-impression keywords that also return low scores on the ‘CTR Difference from Average’ are your top opportunities for optimising CTR. Copy one of these keywords, and head back to Google Search Console. In the queries filter add a filter for that keyword exactly. After that select ‘Pages’ in the filter bar at the top to show pages ranking for that keyword. The page listed first should be the page you need to optimise. Top ways to optimise for CTR By now, we have the keywords and pages that we need to optimise for. We just need to go through the process of actually improving our pages. Here are some different things you can do to improve CTR: Adjust title tags to contain the words or phrases you are getting a low CTR on. You can improve this further by combining your SEO focused keywords with other call to actions that will entice users to click your listing. Another thing you can do is compare your listing to what is currently in the titles for Adwords listings. What is in these titles has usually been optimised and tweaked heavily to improve CTR, because of this taking inspiration from them is a good idea. Optimise meta descriptions to include terms you are trying to improve CTR for. Including the term means they will be bolded in search results which will increase the chance of them being clicks. It is best practice to optimise each description individually to increase the chance users will click it, so try to avoid generating these based off of a couple of variables if possible. Again, for meta descriptions you can also look towards Adwords listings for inspiration. Optimise URLs to include target keywords. Similar to meta descriptions including target terms in URLs means they will be bolded. Add relevant schema markup to the page to generate rich snippets on your listing. This can have a pretty dramatic effect on CTR, especially for schema markup that substantially enhances your listing such as review and product markup. Once you have done any or all of the above, check how organic traffic changes. Then go back and retest something different. You can rinse and repeat this process until you are seeing diminishing returns from improving CTR for a page. Final words Overall we can say that CTR is something that is being used by Google one way or another. Rand seems to have uncovered ways in which it is used directly and temporarily to modify search results. Paul Haahr from Google has informed us it is used indirectly to measure the quality of search results. Because of the above, and because it can simply increase organic traffic, CTR is something you should be taking into consideration when optimising your site. Along with focusing more on click through rate, SEOs need to become more aware that while getting a site technically fit for purpose, writing great content, and building quality links is important. We should also spend more time thinking about user engagement and UX, as they are both becoming a more and more important aspect to consider when trying to perform well in search results.

"And our approach is simple — your chat history is saved for you until you choose to delete it.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink the factoid of the matter When brands played censor   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Last week, bovines’ right to privacy made the news. Google blurred the face of a cow grazing somewhere in Cambridge, UK in its Street View site. The Internet major has been blurring people’s faces on the application since 2008 after concerns about privacy were raised. The picture found its way on to Twitter and caused much amusement, resulting in Google explaining itself thus: “We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous. “Of course, we don't begrudge this cow milking its five minutes of fame.” Another case of a brand trying to play censor played out earlier in the month. Facebook was in the news for a dispute over its taking down a well-known picture of napalm bombing during the Vietnam war. The 1972 picture, which shows a naked girl fleeing the scene, was posted by the editor of a Norwegian newspaper, whose own account was suspended after he tried reposting it with a comment from the subject of the photo. To Facebook, the photo was an instance of objectionable and disturbing material, and did not meet its community standards. An open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and expressions of solidarity in the form of several postings of that picture, including one by Erna Solberg, Norway’s Prime Minister, made the social network reverse its decision. In the Internet age, acts of this sort have a Streisand effect – information sought to be played down or suppressed have the consequence of being widely publicised. Singer and entertainer Barbra Streisand in 2003 attempted to suppress photographs of her Malibu home but ended up drawing further public attention to it. American retail chain Office Depot was accused of religious discrimination when it refused to print an anti-abortion pamphlet on the grounds that the content was against company policy. Reacting to complaints, the chain said the pamphlet, a prayer calling for an end to abortion, sale of body parts and enlightenment, contained material that advocated the harassment of pro-choice supporters. A public interest law group took up cudgels for Maria Goldstein, a Roman Catholic, who had been turned away by the store. Office Depot apologised to the customer for being inconvenienced and stated that its initial reaction was in no way related to her religious beliefs. Last year, toy building brick company Lego was also accused of censorship by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, a critic of the government in China. He said it refused to sell him bricks directly. Ai had used Lego earlier to create portraits of political dissidents exhibited at Alcatraz prison in 2014. He alleged that its decision was tied to the announcement that a Legoland theme park would open in Shanghai. In January this year, Lego announced that it would stop asking bulk customers the purpose of their purchase. It said customers should make it clear that the company does not endorse works shown in public.

Now the search giant has brought the beta version of Google Play to Chrome OS 53 with an update to stable channel version 53.0.2785.129. On its release page, the company confirmed the latest stable channel release was meant only for the Acer Chromebook R11 and Asus Chromebook Flip right now, and detailed availability of the Google Play app in beta. The Chromebook Pixel (2015) was not listed, which raised some eyebrows, as it was these three laptops that had support for Android apps and Google Play in the beta channel. Speaking to Venture Beat however, a Google spokesperson indicated the Chromebook Pixel (2015) will also get the update soon, "A beta release of the Play store is available to users now on the Acer R11 and Asus Flip (and coming soon to Pixel 2015) and can be enabled from the Settings page." These three laptops, alongside the HP Chromebox CB1 and Acer C7 Chromebook, did not receive the last stable channel update.It should be also noted that Google Play is disabled by default and requires to be manually enabled from Chrome Settings with the latest update. To recall, Google Play made it to the Dev channel of Chrome OS in June and the Beta channel in August. Now it has finally made its way to the stable channel. The v53.0.2785.129 update also brings bug fixes, security updates, and feature enhancements, apart from a kernel version update. For now, it's still not known when Google will bring Android app support and Google Play access to all other eligible Chrome OS machines. Chrome OS 53 added Overview mode, which allows you to see all your open tabs with a shortcut key or three finger swipe on the trackpad. The update also brought along Material Design Layout to the build. Google also added new APIs to the Chrome OS 53 that allow you to enable the watchdog timers for kiosk apps that utilise full-screen modes on Chromebooks.

Real-time information is already widely used in facilities management to monitor emission and reduce energy use, for example. And it’s increasingly being employed by companies to improve their water and waste management — by pinpointing water leaks, tracking employees’ shower time, and highlighting materials being recycled and thrown in the trash. A big data partnership announced today — a collaboration between the White House, the World Resources Institute, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other public and private entities — will also provide a tool to help corporations make long-term infrastructure decisions by improving their climate resilience planning. The project is called the Partnership for Resilience and Preparedness (PREP). “Understanding the threats posed by climate change and extreme weather are critical to protecting people, homes, businesses and livelihoods. Data must be part of the solution,” said Janet Ranganathan, vice president for science and research at World Resources Institute. The open-source platform will help communities, companies and investors first access the latest climate-relevant data, and then translate that data into usable information to make better planning and business decisions, Ranganathan told Environmental Leader. “PREP will help companies manage the physical risks of climate change by providing easy access to location-specific data that can be integrated into planning, operational, and investment decisions,” she said. “For instance, utilities will be able to access data on how droughts or sea level rise could impact planned power plant locations while manufacturers could assess the risks from more frequent and extensive flooding on their operations.” The partner organizations reads like a who’s who of top government agencies and data providers. Others working on platform development include the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy NASA, NOAA, the US Global Change Research Program, the US Department of the Interior, Amazon Web Services, CARTO, Descartes Labs, Earth Knowledge, Esri, Forum One, Google Cloud Platform, Google Earth Engine and Vizzuality. Additional working group collaborators include Earth Science Information Partners, Future Earth, Group on Earth Observations, IBM and Microsoft. “Decision-makers today are facing increasingly complex challenges related to climate change,” said Rob Bernard, chief environmental strategist of Microsoft in a statement. “By making critical data both more accessible and rapidly available, we can accelerate the development of tools, such as PREP, that harness that data to empower communities to make smarter decisions.” Plus, the diverse set of partners — from government, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations — will make climate data easier to access and use, Ranganathan said. Instead of relying on static reports or sifting through hundreds of sources with conflicting and confusing data, PREP will provide dynamic data, climate reports and projections directly sourced from NASA, NOAA, and others as they become available. The platform will also be technology agnostic to suit the needs of all users. “It will be much easier to access robust up to date information on climate impacts, combine that data with their own location specific data, and get it in the hands of those in their company who can use it to make better decisions,” Ranganathan said. The PREP beta platform is launching today with domestic and international collaborators including Sonoma County, California; the Washington State Climate Impacts Group; Porto Alegre, Brazil; and the US National Climate Assessment team. PREP plans to scale up after launch with testing in other communities around the globe over the next 12 months. The partners say the goal is to expand data transparency so users know if data comes from governments or commercial entities. They expect users to be able to create customized climate risk dashboards within one year. In the interim, the partnership will add datasets and case studies as available. “Companies can use the data and resources already on the site,” Ranganathan said. “Over time we will add new data sets and functionality, including the ability to create personalized dashboards of climate risks. We will pilot the customized dashboard feature with a variety of users, including business. Given the work of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) we envision growing business demand for the type of data and resources provided on the PREP platform.” And considering risks from climate change impacts like more frequent and extreme storms, floods and droughts are expected to increase 50 percent over the next 12 years, we expect this type of planning tool to play a leading role in business decisions.

Taiwanese government demands Google delete satellite photos of mysterious structures that have sent internet into a frenzy The curious shapes have appeared off the shore of a fiercely disputed territory in the South China Sea By MARK HODGE 22nd September 2016, 3:11 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments THE Taiwanese government has asked Google to blur out satellite photos which show mysterious structures which have baffled online users. The curious Google Earth images show four three-pronged shapes located off the northern shore of Itu Aba island – which is a disputed territory in the South China Sea. Experts believe the structures are military installations although it is unclear whether they are for defence, attack or surveillance. Google Earth 3 The Google Earth images have caused a stir online 3 Taiwan has asked Google to blur the mysterious shapes As speculation grows, the secretive Taiwan government has petitioned the tech giant to blur the scans citing national security concerns. The land, also known as Taiping Island, is the subject of fierce international dispute with Taiwan, China, Vietnam and the Philippines all staking a claiming for the territory. Chen Chung-chi, Taiwan’s Defence Ministry and Coastguard, confirmed his country had asked Google to blur the images. However, he would not reveal the true nature of the mysterious shapes. related stories 'WHY ARE THE BRITISH SO UGLY AND STUPID?'

Dustin Wang, a former government adviser, says he is certain that Taiwan is building military structures on the disputed island. He said: “I think it will definitely be for military purposes. 3 Experts believe the shapes are military structures “But I cannot tell if it is for defending, attacking or monitoring.” He said the location of the shapes, which face the main seaborne traffic, suggests they could be sophisticated look-out posts. China has controversially built military structures near other disputed territories. And hard-line Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte has insisted the on-going dispute will soon turn violent.

News & Analysis Amazon Echo & How It Resonates Junko Yoshida 9/22/2016 09:55 AM EDT 4 comments NO RATINGS 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet PARIS — Whatever you call them — smart microphones, virtual digital assistant, personal home robots, The Control Voice or R2D2 — Amazon Echo-like products are on the rise. Amazon's Echo (left), Dot The second generation Echo Dot, whose price has been just dropped from $89.99 to $49.99 compared with its first generation version, will be on sale in the U.S. market next month. Amazon’s Echo (and subsequent Dot) has opened a new market enabling device vendors to compete on better audio quality in voice capture, higher mic audio resolution, more sophisticated background noise filtering, better far field detection, and unflappable connectivity. Companies like XMOS, although whose chips not designed in Echo, say they are geared up for the new voice interface market. Paul Neil, vice president and business development at XMOS, told EE Times last week, “[The] Internet of things are a bit of a movable feast right now. But to control these [IoT] devices, voice is the most natural user interface.”  With “a unique combination of conventional microcontroller performance, embedded DSP and flexible I/O,” Neil said, “We have the technology that’s an ideal match for voice interfaces.” The battle among hardware devices, however, is only half the story that makes up the smart microphone/speaker market. “The real competitive variables come from the cloud side of the equation,” Paul Erickson, senior analyst of connected home at IHS Markit, told EE Times. In pursuit of a smart microphone that’s even smarter (capable of handling complex queries and random questions), the race over competence in cloud services is accelerating. Google is expected to enter the market with Google Home and Google Assistant (successor to Google Now) late this year, Erickson explained. “And there are plenty of rumors that Apple will likely enter the market too in 2017, using Siri.” One more reason why Amazon Echo, an IoT device, is hot is its potential to achieve one of the most important IoT virtues: Future-proofing. Skip Ashton, vice president of software at Silicon Labs, last week told a media briefing in Germany that future-proofing means “ensuring that a device can continue to add more features as time goes on.” The Alexa voice service for the Echo was first launched with 70 skills, but it now has over 1700, said Ashton. Echo can answer questions, read the news, give sports scores, control lights, order products from Amazon and set an alarm clock. Users also can use the device to order rides from Uber and pizza from Domino’s. “The Echo is updated every 2 weeks in the cloud,” said Ashton. “Amazon sends a Friday e-mail to Echo users announcing new capabilities – ‘Here is what is new with Alexa this week!’” Ashton concluded that Echo users “have generally been delighted” as its uses have grown. Local intelligence Tom Hackenberg, principal analyst, embedded processors at IHS Markit, articulated why Amazon Echo matters to the electronics industry – probably better than anyone. He told us that a smart microphone/smart speaker application is “extremely valuable to processor vendors.” Such devices are not only crucial to providing “local intelligence.” The voice interface is proliferating everywhere -- across a broad market spectrum. Not only is the digital assistant market emerging as a consumer electronics device version of a smartphone app, said Hackenberg, “the speaker is not the only form factor.” He explained, “There will likely be home automation hubs and digital assistance built into TVs, Set-top boxes, HVAC/environmental control hubs and more. It is also a significant application in automotive infotainment systems, especially because of its hands free benefits.” Next page: Peeling down Echo, Echo Dot Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 3 Next > More Related Links AT&T: SIMs are Key to IoT Future 2016 ACE Awards Finalists Announced Google's Mobile VR Still a Wild West Where Are We with Thread IoT?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds subscribe Site Archive Economic impact of religion: New report says it's worth more than Google, Apple and Amazon combined Wednesday Sep 21, 2016 at 12:01 AM Sep 21, 2016 at 9:28 AM A first-of-its-kind analysis of religion's socio-economic value shows that faith-related businesses and institutions add more than $1 trillion to the U.S. economy. Kelsey Dallas, Deseret News If U.S. religion was its own country, it would be the 15th largest economy in the world, according to a new study that presents faith in financial terms. Religion-related businesses and institutions, as well as houses of worship, bring in more revenue each year than Google, Apple and Amazon combined, contributing around $1.2 trillion annually to America's GDP, according to "The Socio-economic Contributions of Religion to American Society: An Empirical Analysis," soon to be published in the Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion. Authors Brian Grim, an associate scholar with Georgetown University's Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, and his daughter Melissa Grim, a research fellow at the Newseum, calculated this figure using annual reports from religious organizations and other national data from 2014. For example, they summed the annual tuition paid to religious schools in order to estimate the economic worth of faith-related educational institutions. Brian Grim, a former Pew Research Center analyst who is also president of the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation, which has argued for religious liberty as a key driver of economic growth and opportunity outside the United States, said this first-of-its-kind effort showcases the positive benefits of religion in the U.S. at a time when belief is often in the news for its negative side effects, such as clergy sexual abuse and religiously motivated violence. "Do we need to know (religion's socio-economic value) in order to appreciate the value of faith? Of course not," he said. "But in an age where fewer people are raised in religious congregations, we need to show a more balanced perspective on faith than might come through in daily headlines." The report comes in the wake of surveys that have shown religious practice is on the decline, reminding people of what would be lost if faith disappeared from society. "Imagine what would happen if everyone woke up and said, 'I'm not religious and I don't want to join a congregation,'" said Ram Cnaan, director of the Program for Religion and Social Policy Research at the University of Pennsylvania, noting that more than 1.5 million full-time workers at churches could lose their jobs. The calculations The study separates U.S. religion's socio-economic contributions into four categories: congregations themselves, faith friendly businesses, religious institutions and benefits to individuals. These first three measures are relatively straightforward. For example, to assign a value to congregations, the Grims totaled the average annual incomes of U.S. houses of worship. Congregations "are hiring staff, paying electricity bills, getting snow removed (from their parking lot), purchasing flowers" and taking part in a variety of other activities that benefit local economies, Brian Grim said. The institutions category, accounting for $302 billion, includes the annual revenues of faith-based health care organizations, schools and charities, which add economic value to communities by hiring workers and supporting people in need. The businesses category, totaling $438.4 billion, might be a little more surprising, Grim noted. The study not only includes obviously religious industries, like annual kosher food sales, but also faith friendly businesses, such as Tyson Foods, which employs chaplains to minister to employees. It was most difficult for the Grims to arrive at a valuation of the individual and social impact of America's 344,000 congregations. They wanted to account for services like providing counseling to people with substance abuse problems or job training for unemployed church members. They arrived at $243.9 million with the help of Cnaan's previous research, in which he quantified the social goods that congregations offer to their communities. In other words, the study offers an educated guess, but social science experts said it's more likely that it undervalues the socio-economic worth of religion in the U.S. than overvalues it. "If somebody said to me, 'Religion contributes about 7 percent of America's GDP,'" I would think it's in the ballpark," said William Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. He noted that the Grims' research process was reasonable given that the ideal methodology wasn't available. They couldn't "run a controlled experiment on two Americas: one America with religious individuals and activities … and the other America with (religion) just pulled out," he said. And so the study offers $1.2 trillion as a best estimation, as well as a smaller and larger figure arrived at using more conservative and less conservative methods, respectively. "The study's most conservative estimate, which takes into account only the revenues of faith-based organizations, is $378 billion annually — or more than a third of a trillion dollars," the study reports. The higher-end estimate, $4.8 trillion, assumes that religious practices affects the economic decisions made by people of faith. It includes average income for every religiously affiliated American. Asserting religion's economic value Social science experts call the Grims' data a starting point for faith leaders and policymakers alike who have struggled to articulate what congregations offer as churches shut their doors in cities across the country. "One of the things that's problematic for religious leaders is how to show they're relevant in their communities," Cnaan said. The estimated $1.2 trillion economic impact "is a beginning number and I think there will be a discussion by experts," he said. "In maybe 10 years, we may sit down and say, 'Brian Grim was very or too conservative.' But we have a number to start with." Galston, who served as a policy adviser for President Bill Clinton, said this effort to assign a monetary value to U.S. religion is meaningful for people advocating for religious interests, whether in the White House, state legislatures or community organizations. "Work like this makes it more likely that (religion) will be taken seriously in the corridors of power," he said. Cnaan, who describes himself as secular, has dedicated the last 25 years of his career to quantifying the benefits of religion. His work had been used to estimate the impact of the government's Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. Cnaan said he applauds the Grims' research because it asserts the value of faith at a time when many Americans are leaving formal religious practice behind. The number of religiously unaffiliated adults in the U.S. rose seven percentage points over the last decade, from 16.1 percent in 2007 to 22.8 percent in 2014, according to Pew Research Center. Although the study does imply that increasing secularization could create a kind of economic crisis, Cnaan's doomsday scenario doesn't account for the ways in which nonbelievers also gather together to bring about social good. For example, members of Oasis, a secular group present in several cities in the Bible Belt, come together on service days to rake leaves or volunteer at a food bank, as The Atlantic reported. The authors note in the report's conclusion that they haven't provided a cost-benefit analysis comparing public and faith-based programs. They don't claim that congregations always provide social services more efficiently or that businesses friendly to faith offer better products. However, Grim does view the study as a reminder of what's lost when churches close their doors for good. Without religion, U.S. society would be weaker, both economically and socially, he said. "I don't think we'd see all of the good of society disappearing. But I think it would be significantly less," Grim noted. His research should be a cause for celebration for people of faith across the country, Cnaan said. "I wish I could go to every congregation and say, 'You're part of something very big and something very important,'" he added.

Billboards in the United States, building-side projections in Germany — timed to coincide with Cologne’s Photokina exhibition — and even a freaking statue have all popped up in recent days. It feels very much like the bubbling start to a high-pressure marketing campaign that’s going to boil over as Google’s announcement day approaches. This isn’t atypical for Google, which has previously dominated Times Square with its Android advertising, but the difference is that the big ads are focused on the hardware now. Hell, Google’s video teaser literally transmogrifies the digital search box into the outline of a physical phone. How does this relate to the iPhone? Well, most things in the world relate to the iPhone in some way nowadays, but my reading of Google’s actions is that it’s ready to finally become the purveyor of true premium Android phones. You might say Google had already done that with the Nexus 6P of last year, but that phone still felt like a continuation of the Nexus line: an example for others to follow and not the Android phone that Google thinks everyone should buy. The buildup to this year’s launch has included leaks of two sizes (to cover as many people as possible), some high specs, and the termination of the Nexus name in favor of Google’s in-house premium brand of Pixel. And Google has thrown in its own extra hint with the #MadeByGoogle hashtag — to say nothing of an entire website on with the "madeby" subdomain. Google is going from flirting to being fully committed For as long as the Nexus line has existed, Google has been only flirting with the idea of being a hardware manufacturer and vendor. Without it, the Mountain View company is set to throw the full force of its considerable brand cachet behind the new phones coming next month. So now Google is about to launch the best-specced, best-supported, most up-to-date Android phones just in time for the holidays. Because the category of "premium Android" matters too much to be left in the hands of others. Premium Android is the segment of the vast legions of Android phones that actually competes directly against Apple’s iPhone. From among them, Sony’s Xperia series has been perpetually hamstrung by some fatal flaw or another (and also completely absent from the US market), HTC’s flagships have been expensive but imperfect, LG’s best has been plastic for far too long, and Huawei’s ascent hasn’t yet reached full global scale. Only Samsung was doing well in challenging the iPhone worldwide, but its Note 7 battery debacle has set it back dramatically. There simply isn’t a legitimate, trustworthy brand to put against the iPhone. Google wants to be that brand. Apple tailors iOS to its latest iPhones, and it seems like Google wants to take a similarly integrated approach The iPhone’s greatest strength has, from the outset, been Apple’s unmatched vertical integration. It’s not about the design, processor, software, or services in isolation. The App Store didn’t make the iPhone, the A series chips didn’t make it, and neither did Jony Ive’s considered design or the quality and efficiency of iOS. It was all of those things, working in concert — as Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller reminded us at the iPhone 7’s launch. The only way to compete with such coordinated design and engineering is to recreate it, and Google is the only company in existence capable of doing so, because it’s the only company to command a mobile app store as good as Apple’s (in fact, the Play Store is such a big deal that European regulators are investigating whether Google’s control of it constitutes anticompetitive behavior). Read more: It's time for Google to make its own hardware The #MadeByGoogle label is, in my judgment, highly significant here. An endless parade of leaks and insider reports has all but assured us that HTC will be the producer of Google’s new phones, which are anticipated to bear Google’s Pixel brand. But not one of those reports indicates there’ll be any HTC branding on the phones, breaking definitively with the Nexus tradition. HTC is returning to its white-label manufacturing roots, and Google is brashly asserting that it has "made" its new phones. That might sound like an overreach on Google’s part, but I can see the intended meaning: the new Pixel phones will be a cohesive experience that combines hardware and software — like the iPhone — and therefore it’s valid to say that the combined creation is #MadeByGoogle. We should all be excited about this move from Google. The first generation of Pixel phones might not immediately wow us, but that will be because they are the first generation. The first iPhone didn’t even have an app store. But once a company takes the reins of both hardware specs and software changes, it can coordinate the two and build up a cumulative advantage, much like Apple has. Google looks set to finally accept the responsibility that many of us thought it already had: to provide a legitimate competitor to the iPhone that didn’t have to overcome a billion hurdles just to be an equal footing. These new Pixel phones will be something altogether new from Google, and they could well set the whole mobile industry on a whole different trajectory. So yes, that’s exciting. That’s big.

Since the Android Nougat OTA started rolling out at the start of the month, a number of Nexus 5X users have taken to Reddit and the Nexus Help Forums to report that their device has become prone to random crashes and boot loops since updating to the latest version of Google’s operating system. There’s currently no known fix that makes the issue go away for good. However, some users report downgrading to Android 6.0 Marshmallow can help, while others claim reflashing the Android 7.0 Nougat September update is worth a shot. For its part, Google says the bug is a known issue. Orrin, a Google employee, stated the following on the Nexus Help Forums: “We understand that a very small number of users are experiencing a bootloop issue on the Nexus 5X. We are continuing to investigate the situation, but can confirm that this is strictly a hardware related issue. For those of you that are currently experiencing this, please contact your place of purchase for warranty or repair options.” Have you experienced this issue with your Nexus 5X? Tell us in the comment section. SourceNexus Help Forums, Reddit ViaAndroid Authority Ipse Who would have expected that from Goobble. It’s Me Wonder if the same people that were screaming about the iOS upgrade server load issues will be as upset about this. Particularly those who aren’t iPhone users and were the most upset. HatInTheRing It’s Me is still out there trolling, hey? How long have you been trying to start arguments and convince people iPhone is the best now? 2 years? 3? Your comments are never intelligent. Do you ever have a single thing to say that isn’t looped into a “this never happens to apple and apple is perfect” argument with people who are trying to have real tech conversations? It’s transparent trolling. Contribute or move on, dude. Honestly. I’ve never said a word to you but reading your stuff hundreds of times over the past years is impacting intelligent people with real information and comments to share. But I guess that’s your goal, isn’t it? It’s Me Hey there. I see you picked a new name, Awesome. I’ve never once, in my life, said that Apple is perfect nor that they never have problems. Since it went way over your head, that was actually the exact point of my comment. Duh. When the last iOS update game out and the server load caused some updates to fail, all the regular trolls came and and were bitching about Apple quality going down hill and how it was such a horrible ordeal, though most of them were not iPhone users. So, if these Android users were so upset about an iPhone bug, surely they must be at least a little upset by an even worse bug that affects Android uses. Was that really such a difficult concept for a bright guy, such as yourself? Duh. What when it you were saying about impacting intelligent people with real information? Are you one of them? It seems not. What is your “real information”? WTF is “real information”? If you are an example of an intelligent person, I weep for our future, because honestly, you seem exceptionally dim. HatInTheRing Let’s make this comment section, right here, your therapy. Get it all out. Rather than just little jabs 50 times a day, here is your stage. Why do you hate Google so much? I actually want to know. It can’t be that its search engine powers your iPhone. Or that you likely use google maps because imaps is a bungle. Do you fear google? Do you hate that everyone on earth doesn’t have the same phone (iPhone). Are you jealous? Because that’s why a lot of people get defensive and lash out. Maybe if the Internet gives you the opportunity to really get this off your chest, the tech blogosphere will be a better place for everyone. It’s Me I love google. I hate hypocrisy and stupidity. You seem to stand out. Mikoto Misaka To be honest apple maps works just as well if not better than google maps on iOS 10. Granted it took a while to get there but it’s my preferred maps application on iOS now. St. Misery Remember when you’d get a new Nokia brick or Moto Razr and it just worked, forever? No exploding battery, no boot loop, no bricking. Mikoto Misaka Remember when you couldn’t use those devices to access full web pages, play games, interact with social media, take high quality photos and video, stream music from the internet, watch videos? You can still buy a flip phone that will work for a long time. Look for SONIM phones. Allan No boot or freeze issues on my 5X. However, my battery has been draining significantly more overnight. Kevin Hegarty hey i am the same on my nexus 6p its so frustrating as lots of people have no issues but I cant find a solution Mo Dabbas Did you try resetting the phone or wipe the cache? It sometimes happens that some files from the old OS doesn’t work well with the new and causes battery drains. gstone Something similar happened to my roommate’s Nexus 5 (not 5x) two days ago. Randomly shut down, got stuck booting, and then couldn’t complete the factory reset. He replaced the phone… Ali F. That is the power button. Known issue with Nexus 5. HatInTheRing Hopefully one day LG makes a phone without the bootloop issue. That completes cycle of every phone LG has made over the past 6 years having boot loop issues. I’d never buy an LG. V20 aspirerers, beware. Ali F. I had LG Chic, Optimus, Optimus One, G2, G3. and now G4 for me and my son. My friend has also the G4 and another the G3 and never have any problem! in my experience that is a good record. The LG with which I have issues is the Nexus 5.

BN Travel: IK Nwosu’s Fun & Adventure with #GPhotosNG at Erin Ijesha Waterfalls & Ikogosi Warm Springs 22.09.2016 at 3:08 pm By IK Nwosu 22 Comments Hi everyone! IK Nwosu here. So, I got back from my road trip to Ikogosi Warm Springs, Ekiti state, yesterday, and I’m both excited and sad. Excited because I’m back to share the adventurous and fun-filled experience with you, and sad because… I’m back. We made a stop at Erin Ijesha Waterfalls in Osun state. It was my first time at both locations and I had so much fun. L-R: Chiamaka (Social Prefect), Kunmi, Tosin, Demola, IK, Bella Rose, Folarin, Kolapo, LazyWrita (Paul), Nosa The trip was sponsored by Google Nigeria, and I and 12 other Bloggers and Media Personalities shared the adventure together. I got to the Quadrant MSL Group‘s office at 7:47 for an 8AM call. Folarin, Chiamaka (Social Prefect), Chinwe (Metezy Photography) were already there. As soon as I arrived, I signed in and got my Ankara bag containing lots of goodies. We later got a box of snacks each to keep body and soul together till we get to have lunch. Bag of Goodies Snack Box We didn’t leave until about 10:30AM, so we had time to hang out with each other before the actual hangout. The Tour Bus: It was a road trip and that was, for me, one of the coolest part of it all. We got to explore the beauty of nature from Lagos, through Ogun, Oyo, Osun states, and then to Ekiti State… the Palace of Iyan (Pounded Yam). We quickly got moving and everyone introduced themselves. Mich, Google’s PR Lead in South Africa, Kunmi from Mirusevents, Nosa (Quadrant MSL Group), LazyWrita (Paul), Demola Expoze, Tosin (OloriSupergal), Lamide, Bella Rose, and Kolapo. We had a quick game of ‘Two Truths and a Lie’. So, you make three statements and everyone takes a guess on which of the statements is false, and the ones they think is true. Here’s a personal example: I’ve featured in a Nollywood Film. I wrote a book at 16. I play three musical instruments. So, tell me what you think is true, and what you think is a lie. (I’ll answer it by 10PM Nigerian Time today). After that we played the ‘concentration game’. I got out in the first round… So I won’t talk about it. LOL…. Okay let me just do it. So, someone asks the group to give names of things/people/places that can be classified into a group. Something that’s not like names of female anopheles mosquitoes along Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Social Prefect said we should give female Yoruba names that starts with letter ‘A’. She said ‘Abisola’, Demola said ‘Adenike’, Kunmi said ‘Adetokunbo’, and there I was thinking whether Adetoun, Adeola, Adunni, or Anwurika, were female Yoruba names. After all the rounds, LazyWrita won the game, and he got his price… One N50 Yoghurt. We saw the beautiful scenery and landscape of Lagos-Ibadan with minor interruptions from trailers and petrol tankers. It was really amazing. Along Lagos – Ibadan Expressway, Ogun State. #GPhotosNG #BNInIkogosi A video posted by BellaNaija (@bellanaijaonline) on Sep 20, 2016 at 4:24am PDT Ibadan We got to the big city of Ibadan, navigated through Ife, and got to the Erin Ijesha Community. We got there at about 2PM. When we got down from the bus, we had one of the coolest welcome parties in the world. The Adventure Began From This Point. Such Beauty! So Guys! We’re here at the first location – Erin Ijesha Waterfalls in Osun state. I really can’t wait for the fun and adventure. Follow our Insta Story for more updates #GPhotosNG #BNInIkogosi A video posted by BellaNaija (@bellanaijaonline) on Sep 20, 2016 at 7:16am PDT We’re having our welcome party 😆 #GPhotosNG #BNInIkogosi A video posted by BellaNaija (@bellanaijaonline) on Sep 20, 2016 at 7:28am PDT A hunter, Akila, the brother of Oduduwa discovered the Waterfall. Oduduwa named it Erin Ijesa connoting a peaceful place. #GPhotosNG #BNInIkogosi A video posted by BellaNaija (@bellanaijaonline) on Sep 20, 2016 at 7:34am PDT Our Tour Guide told us that the Falls was discovered by a hunter, named Akila, who is the brother of Oduduwa. Akila  discovered the Falls about 831 years ago. He said Oduduwa named it Erin Ijesha, connoting peace. The Falls is also a god, named Olumirin. The Erin Ijesha Waterfalls have 7 levels… and it’ll take you like a million steps to get to the second level from the first. We could only get to the second level, and fortunately, it’s the highest of the seven. By the time we got to the second level, our legs were vibrating like a hen that just had a bath. It was beautiful. It was peaceful. It was amazing. It was huge. We thought getting to the second level was easy, until we start descending. Phew! At some point, I was afraid my femur will just break up with my pelvic girdle. But we survived. A model of what the topmost part of the Falls looks like Those guys behind said they were having a ‘shower’. That looks like a ‘hailstorm’ to me. Social Prefect and IK L-R: Nosa, Kolapo, IK When a photographer (Guy in blue tees) photobombs your photo! L-R: IK, Nosa, Kolapo, Bela Rose, Tosin, Mich. After we got down from what was like the equivalent of a 10-storey building (From the second level of the Falls). Social Prefect and Lamide behind me. Left there by 4:45PM and got back on the move… tired, hungry. We quickly grabbed something to eat and continued our journey. Folarin and I At some point, I discovered that I had little memory space on my phone. I had copied some heavy files on my phone prior to the trip and I didn’t have a memory card. While this would have been a disappointment, I smiled because, Google Photos got my back. I quickly backed up all the photos I had taken on Google Photos, and cleared up some space for more! Google Photos is like one of the coolest things on the planet at the moment. It lets you import all your photos from your library to its unlimited storage space. You can download from the App stores of your Android and iOS devices. Once that is done, you import the photos from your library to Google Photos. Once there, the ‘magic’ can begin. You also have to enable backup so that nothing is lost or in a case of low storage space. First is that Google taught a machine how to identify things and place in any photo you have taken at whatever time. So, once you type anything in a photo you took in 2013, or the place you took the photo, the photo, among others in the same category will come up. Down at the bottom of the Photos app, you’ll see a tab marked “Assistant”. This is where things get really clever. The assistant can edit your photos if it thinks it’s really cool and suggest to you for review. It can also create a GIF or video from photos and/or videos you have taken and suggests to you too.   Sometimes, the Assistant will also show you a Timehop-style “Rediscover this Day” picture of something you were doing about the same time a year ago. You can easily share these on social media. See an amazing video Google Photos Assistant did for our trip: https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MOVIE.mp4 So, we got talking on the bus, and somehow somehow, we started discussing about the Recession. You really can’t have a conversation in Nigeria these days without that popping up. We got to Ikogosi late at night so we could not do a tour of the place. But I was happy. After two dead power banks one dead laptop, and ‘low battery’ calling me several times, the wall socket at the reception was ‘bae’. At the reception of Ikogosi Warm Springs Resort. L-R: IK, Bella Rose, Demola We got to our rooms, freshened up and came out for dinner. Nothing like Fitfam that night o. This was about 9:30PM and we were munching Rice & Plantain and/or Iyan & Efo/Egusi like Savage Soldiers. Everything had a hint of red in it. Our eyes were red with hunger while our mouths were ready to devour anything in sight… and we did! Phew! Finally in my room. 😊 Ikogosi Warm Springs Resort is a really cool place. 😎 #BNInIkogosi #GPhotosNG A video posted by BellaNaija (@bellanaijaonline) on Sep 20, 2016 at 2:36pm PDT Inside my room In my ‘Kelechi Amadi-Obi’ Mode. LOL Dinner! Iyan (Pounded Yam) and Egusi soup. I used my hand! Fork and Knife was for beauty. Rice, Stew, and Dodo (Plantain) We were done in like an hour and we all headed back to our rooms. For me, Folarin and Chinwe, the walk back to our rooms could compete with the ‘long walk to freedom’ in ‘Any Book of World Records’. We were lodged outside the area where everyone was. Chinwe (Metezy Photography), Me, and Folarin walking back to the restaurant Wednesday morning The resort was serene and beautiful. As soon as I got back to the room, I quickly located the spot on my bed where the internet reception was good and began to upload all the upload-ables. Few minutes later, I slept. I didn’t sleep for too long and I honestly did not know why. Got up 3:30AM and could not sleep again. I think this post woke me up, because as soon as I found out that trying to get back to sleep was like Arsenal FC trying to win the Premiership, I gave up and wrote the first half of this post. You know how fast the time runs when you are doing what you love? That happened to me. In a matter of what I taught to be 20 minutes, it was 5:45AM. I was already done with the activities of Tuesday, so I was fine. Breakfast was for 6:30AM, so I had enough time to get ready. You know, there were no Foundation, Eye Shadow, Concealer, Mascara, etc obstacle courses to surmount. I got out of the room and here’s what I saw: We gathered at the restaurant, and after the ‘good mornings’ and the ‘how was your nights?’ (like I knew what was happening during my sleep), someone finally asked the all-important question – When is the food getting ready? The Restaurant at the Resort At the Breakfast Table. Me, Bella Rose behind, Chinwe, Folarin, Nosa, Chiamaka (Social Prefect), and Paul (LazyWrita) Finally breakfast was served. I had Yam (Ekiti special) and scrambled eggs, and tea. Some Instagram folks had a problem with the tea in the equation though. But I loved the combination, and I did not find it unusual. I don’t think I’ve had it like that before, but I loved what I saw and I loved how I felt when I chewed and swallowed the yam and egg, and how the tea helped to push it down from time to time. Breakfast! After breakfast we proceeded to take a tour the Ikogosi Warm Springs. For real, one part of my palm felt the warm water and the other part, the cold water While taking this photo, I could feel the heat from the water. Epic un-looking! L-R: Demola, Nosa, LazyWrita, IK Our Tour Guide Narrating the story of the Origin of the Cold and Water Spring So, a certain hunter from Ife named Olosun was walking in the forest when he heard a strange sound -the sound of waters. When he checked he saw the water and discovered that a part was warm while the other was cold. On seeing the springs, he went back to Ife to report what he had seen and ask why it was so. Legend has it that the Ifa narrated the story thus: A certain man, Ogangan had two wives. One of them Awele, was hot tempered, while the other, Awon, was cold tempered. The women were always quarrelling. So one day, while quarrelling, they turned into water. Awele became the warm water while Awon became the cold water. Upon getting back to see what had become of his wives, Olosun transformed into a rock to guide them. Olosun is the rock surrounding the water.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: September 23, 2016 9:58 am Google Allo app: Snowden slams it over privacy concerns. (Source: AP) Google Allo app has serious privacy problems and people should avoid using it, according to NSA Whistleblower Edward Snowden. This is not the first time Snowden has slammed Google and Allo over privacy issues. When the app was first announced in May, Snowden had tweeted, “Google’s decision to disable end-to-end encryption was dangerous,” and that people should avoid the app. After the official launch this week, Snowden tweeted, “Free for download today: Google Mail, Google Maps, and Google Surveillance. That’s #Allo. Don’t use Allo.” When people asked which app should they use for messaging, Snowden replied “use Tor, use Signal.” And someone also asked what Snowden thought about Telegram, another messaging app which has end-to-end encryption in the Secret chat mode. Snowden said Telegram is less safe than WhatApp, and thus dangerous for non-experts. With Google Allo, the privacy issue is a concern for users. It should be noted that at the time of I/O, Google has said all message requests send to Assistant would be stored ‘only transiently’ on their servers and would be eventually deleted. Now Google has gone back on this privacy promise, and says it will be storing all chats permanently in its servers. This means that in case of a legal request from the authorities Google will be able to hand over data to them.

Arvind Kejriwal Attacks Janardhan Reddy Over His Daughter’s Big Fat Wedding But there’s an Incognito mode in Google’s Allo where chats are all end-to-end encrypted and these have an expiry on them. The messages are deleted after sometime and not stored on Google’s servers. In case of WhatsApp though, since it is end-to-end encryption across the app by default none of the messages are stored on the company’s servers. Read more: Google Allo: The turning point of the decline in human interaction? Google has said it needs to keep the conversations in order to ensure the machine-learning based Assistant improves over time. The more a user interacts with it, the better Google Assistant gets and learns more about the user, including the kind of responses they are likely to give. Also read: Snowden asks people to avoid Google Allo over privacy concerns Snowden’s tweets have also sparked a response from Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov who pointed out that most WhatsApp users back up their data on Google Drive/iCloud. Snowden replied, “A citation would be helpful; looks opt-in to me. But in any case externalities are less relevant than app behavior itself.” This is not the first time Twitter has seen a Snowden vs Durov exchange. The NSA whistleblower has in the past questioned Telegram’s security over claims the app was storing plaintext of every message sent or received. Durov had denied this was true. Check out the tweets from Snowden on Allo below, along with Durov’s tweets as well. Free for download today: Google Mail, Google Maps, and Google Surveillance. That’s #Allo. Don’t use Allo. http://t.co/EdPRC0G7Py — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016 Use Tor.

But in any case externalities are less relevant than app behavior itself. — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016 For most companies, messaging is the next space to capture, and Google which has lost the edge with Hangouts is hoping to claw back. In a world where WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger dominate with 1 billion users each, Allo has its task cut out. And the privacy questions which have always persisted with Google are unlikely to die down anytime soon around Allo either. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaDemonetisation: IT surveys real estate firms in Delhi-NCR to check reports of tax evasion IndiaDemonetisation: Half of ATMs to be recalibrated by next week to dispense new Rs 500, Rs 2000 notes IndiaGovt counters Opposition: Those not in favour will be asked if they support black money IndiaNo intention to demonetise Rs 100/50 notes: Government BusinessArun Jaitley on Vijay Mallya: Bad loans write-off doesn't mean we won't pursue it EntertainmentRajinikanth's Enthiran 2.0 poster featuring Akshay Kumar is out, see pic EntertainmentI am besharam, nudity means nothing to me: Ranveer Singh on Befikre EntertainmentDirector Ameer questions Rajinikanth's integrity for supporting PM Modi's demonetisation EntertainmentRamayan's 'Vibhishan' Mukesh Rawal dies in train accident Must Read Sports2nd Test: Bullet loaded, revolver spun, prayer said SportsHere's how India have fared on rank turners SportsKartik explains art of bowling on crumbling wickets TechnologyOnePlus 3T vs iPhone 7 Plus vs Galaxy S7 Edge vs Pixel XL: Flagship wars TechnologyTomTom launches Spark 3, Adventurer sports watches and Touch fitness tracker in India TechnologyGoogle suggests standardised charging, wants to make it safer Lifestyle5 times Sonam Kapoor inspired us to drape a sari in an unusual way for this wedding season Nov 16: Latest News Demonetisation: Undeposited old notes may result in windfall for government Five questions: Government should not have opted for a hurried decision, says JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav Don’t apply indelible ink on left hand, State Election Commission tells Maharashtra government Demonetisation of Rs 500, Rs 1000 notes: Mamata Banerjee leads protest march to Rashtrapati Bhavan The quandary of DCC banks in Maharashtra: Crores in deposit, no money for customers                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

That changed today as Google officially released the latest update for the Acer Chromebook R11 and the ASUS Chromebook Flip, both of which come with full Google Play support for the first time on the stable channel… This new update doesn’t bring any major with just a handful of changes including the new Material Design-inspired Overview UI, the ability to see available storage through the settings menu, and more. So far Google has yet to release this update for the Chromebook Pixel 2, but that should be coming very soon. With Android apps finally debuting in the stable channel, this could also lead to Google finally adding a few more devices to the list of supported models (crossing my fingers on the Dell Chromebook 13).

The app aims to do this by making the planning part a lot more convenient, less stressful and hassle-free. If it sounds too good to be true, you’re right. The good news is, we’re getting there, slowly but surely with travel planner apps. 99 Airport Tips to Travel Like a Pro 99 Airport Tips to Travel Like a Pro For the tired and weary, a vacation always sounds like a good idea. But getting to that beautiful…Read more For those unfamiliar with travel planner apps, you can now easily create your itinerary, book tours, flights, accomodation and car rentals etc. right from your laptop or mobile app. In this list, I have 9 other travel apps apart from Google Trips, each with their own specialty that will probably prove useful for different groups of travelers. You will find apps that let you look up budget hostels or plan multi-city stops easily, online communities that share and feature travel itineraries in exotic locations, and even travel apps that can work offline, like Google Trip. Let’s check them out. Google Trips Google Trips is a new app that helps you plan an upcoming trip. It pools information from airline ticket confirmation emails (flight number, travel dates and destinations) as well as hotel reservations that are sent to your Gmail. That said, this is already available to you if you use Inbox (check the Trips bundle). Based on where you are going, Google Trips offers you relevant travel guides you can download and use offline. The info in the downloaded bundle includes the contact info, ratings and reviews of places to visit (if you have saved places from Maps, it is included too). Pin it Nevertheless if you’re looking for directions, this will require location services and an active Internet connection. As you can tell, a lot of the travel info Google Trips falls back on are made available from other Google services like Google Maps, but as a travel planner app, it probably has to do a lot more to keep up with the rest of the planner apps here. Download: Android | iOS Triphobo If you are an adventurous type but not really a good planner, how about looking at other trips planned by fellow travelers for inspiration? Triphobo lets you look at other globetrotters’ itineraries or find ground tours in over 15,000 cities in the databse. You can work on top of a complete itinerary and customize them to suit your travel style and needs, rather than start from scratch. Pin it On top of that, one of the best things about Triphobo is the smart planner. It is a tool where you can make travel arrangements through multiple cities, all on the same page. Choose the cities you want to stopover, dates of travel, how you want to travel from city to city, book your flights, airline, departure time or buy bus tickets all inside the app. Along the way you can also check the ratings of hotels and other accommodations, as well as find things to do, and make relevant bookings straight from the app itself. Get the app: Android | iOS Gogobot This one is for travelers who have specific needs and would like to get answers to their burning questions before making a booking. Gogobot is a community-powered review site which tackles restaurants, hotels and attractions in major cities. Pin it Its novelty lies in the Gogobot Tribes which refers to something like a travel type. There are tribes called backpackers, history buffs, nightlife lovers, spirital seekers and even vegetarian. When you join a tribe you can access the group’s wisdom by asking them for recommendations, advice, tips and city secrets to make the most out of your trip. Pin it The site also has a full range of hotel deals to choose from in major cities. You can search by the hotel class & type, date of travel or price. These hotels also carry reviews and ratings by Gogobot members. Get the app: Android | iOS Triposo If you’re not sure about the Internet access of your destination, here is an app you can work offline. You just need to download the travel guide for the destination you want first, then you can work the app like an offline map. It sifts through open content sources like Wikipedia Flickr, TouristEye and World66 for data and reviews then comes up with personalized travel guides for users. Pin it The Android app also has a currency converter, weather forecast (requires connection), phrasebooks for your communication needs and info about local festivals, culture and food offerings. While you can book hotels straight from Triposo, the search is powered externally by Booking.com. Get the app: Android | iOS Tripit TripIt is essentially an itinerary maker. It does none of the bookings for you. What it does is help you consolidate all your hotel, flights, tours, rentals and other similar travel arrangements into one place. Using its mobile app you can have access to every detail of your bookings in the same spot, no more rummaging through paperwork or emails and such. Pin it TripIt has two versions: one free, the other Pro ($49 a year). Both let you create, edit, store and share travel plans, as well as sync to your favorite online calendar. However, only the pro version give you more flight-related features such as real-time flight status, better seat notifications, reward points tracking, and VIP travel benefits from their travel partners. Get the app: Android | iOS In case this doesn’t work, try: TripCase Travefy Travefy Personal is a web app that lets travelers plan itineraries and trips together with their friends. The app has 4 basic functions, Itinerary, Invites, Discover and Expenses. With the app, you can organize trips together with you friend (invite them first), and pull up recommendations straight from inside the app. Best of all the app has a good expense management tool to help you and your travelling group keep to your travel budget. Pin it While the planning stage is limited to the web app, Travefy has an Itinerary Viewer app that is available for iOS and Android. On this app, travelers can browse through the details of the itinerary even though there is no Internet connection. Trip Planner Sygic Trip Planner Sygic makes planning trips easier by spreading it all across a map. For those who didn’t really like the Geography subject in school, this can be helpful for planning longer backpacking trips where you go where the wind takes you. Sort destinations by what you want to do (e.g. hiking, snorkeling, shopping), join different types of sightseeing, walking, bike or bus tours — there are fast-track tours available where you can skip the queue — or book hotels all right from the app. Pin it The app works offline and if you have multiple devices with you, it also syncs all your planning through all installed devices. Get the app: Android | iOS WorldMate WorldMate is an itinerary management tool for professionals. All confirmations made via email can be imported into the app to create a complete itinerary. The app also ensures that travelers receive real-time flight status reports and delay alerts, or even book alternative flights, in case of a cancelled flight. The iPhone app in particular lets you search and book hotels, filtered by ratings, location and price. Users can also set alerts to find special hotel prices and the app itself can automatically find better deals from hotels around the same area. Pin it It also has good support for last-minute flight booking, especially if the flight you are supposed to be on has been delayed or cancelled. Make alternative bookings instantly on the app. The app is integrated with LinkedIn and will let you know if a LinkedIn Connection is nearby, and if your travels take you across timezones, the app’s, tip calculator, price and time converters can be of great help. Get the app: Android | iOS | Windows Phone Roadtrippers Roadtrippers is a fun app for those who prefer roadtrips to flights or other means of travel. The only catch is this only works in the US, but for a good reason. If you head on over to the Roadtrippers website you will be treated with plenty of awesome trip guides you can follow. We’re looking at 48-hour guides, National Park visits, trips down the interstate, Offbeat Routes, Scenic Drives, outdoor escapes, movie filming locations and for the brave, Ghost Guides which take you to haunted places! Pin it Plan your roadtrip on the web app or mobile app then share them with the rest of the group. The app also comes with time estimation from Point A to Point B but requires the GPS turned on to work, which may zap your battery juice. Get the app: Android | iOS Lonely Planet Lonely Planet has been a staple name in the travel-the-world group. Its app gives you city guides in multiple countries with listings for sightseeing, shopping, local cultural events, activities and more. There are tours catering to small groups, nature and wildlife, history and culture, and more. Pin it From the site itself, travelers can book flights, hotels, airport transfers, car rental and even buy insurance. Lonely Planet is also home to many articles written by avid travelers sharing their newfound appreciation for a new destination. Articles like this will inspire you to take out your passport and book the next flight out of there.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise The Difference Between Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) and Mobile-Friendly Pages Mobile Search September 22, 2016 Mobile Search Bharati AhujaSeptember 22, 2016 772SHARES 2.5KREADS 772SHARES 2.5KREADS Bharati Ahuja 772SHARES 2.5KREADS No business can underestimate the importance of having their website content being displayed correctly and quickly on the mobile devices. But, with variants like the internet speed and different screen sizes, reaching out on the mobile web is a challenging task. Google has always focused on the user, and the user experience has always been the most important ranking factor. The user experience always starts with the page load time . In some countries where the internet speed is not an issue, the page load time totally depends on the technicalities of the page design and development. Every time a web page takes too long to load, the site owner loses a reader/buyer—and also the opportunity to earn revenue through advertising or subscriptions. Some time back, Google had introduced ‘mobile-friendly’ labels in mobile search results. This label was added to sites which ensured a good mobile experience by being responsive. This label has recently been removed because Google says 85% of all pages in the mobile search results now meet the criteria of the mobile-friendly label. The latest development for improving the mobile search results and the mobile user experience further is The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project, which is an open source initiative that embodies the vision that publishers can create mobile optimized content once and have it load instantly everywhere. AMP is a way to build web pages for static content that render fast. The difference between a mobile-friendly page and AMP can be understood by the following questions. What are Mobile-Friendly Pages? Mobile-friendly pages are pages with Responsive Web Design (RWD). RWD is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices -from desktop computer monitors, tablets to mobile phones. In particular, reacting to the width of the browser window — not just flowing the text, but often changing aspects of page layout. What are Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)? AMP or Accelerated Mobile Pages is an open source initiative by Google launched in October 2015. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) are lightweight pages designed to load quickly on mobile devices. AMP-compliant pages use a subset of HTML with a few extensions. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), is a very accessible framework for creating fast-loading mobile web pages. How Can a Website Become Mobile-Friendly? A website can be made responsive or mobile-friendly by adding Media Queries. Media queries let the display of content be according to the user device without having to change the content itself. It is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. Media queries allow the web page to use different CSS style rules based on the features such as width, height, and color.  A media query is a logical expression that is either true or false. For Example: <!– CSS media query on a link element –> <link rel=”stylesheet” media=”(max-width: 800px)” href=”sample.css” /> <!– CSS media query within a stylesheet –> <style> @media (max-width: 600px) {   .facet_sidebar {     display: none;   } } </style> When a media query is true, the relevant style sheet or style rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules. How Can a Website Become AMP Compliant? A website is made AMP compliant as per instructions on https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/create.html but the AMP pages also have to be made responsive or mobile-friendly. Are There Any Duplicate Content Issues With Responsive Websites? There are no issues related to duplicate content regarding responsive pages. Are There Any Duplicate Content Issues for an AMP Compliant Website? A responsive page or a mobile-friendly page is the same page of the website which is served in a different layout. The pages get displayed according to the device from which they are accessed. AMP pages are served to the user from the Google AMP cache. AMP pages have a different URL. Hence, the duplicate content issue has to be sorted out. The Google AMP Cache is a proxy-based content delivery network for delivering all valid AMP documents. It fetches AMP HTML pages, caches them, and improves page performance automatically. How Can I Solve The Duplicate Content Issue on AMP? If your website is AMP compliant and If you have both AMP and non-AMP versions of your pages, include the following links: On any non-AMP page, reference the AMP version of the page to let Google and other platforms know about it: Add the following to the non-AMP page: <link rel=”amphtml” href=”https://www.example.com/url/to/amp-version.html” />  On the AMP page,  add the following text to reference its non-AMP canonical version: <link rel=”canonical” href=”https://www.example.com/url/to/regular-html-version.html” /> For standalone AMP pages (those that don’t have a non-AMP version) the AMP page should specify itself as the canonical version as follows: <link rel=”canonical” href=”https://www.example.com/url/to/amp-document.html” /> How can I Validate AMP-complaint pages? You can validate AMP on https://validator.ampproject.org/ How Can I Test the Mobile-Friendliness of the Website? You can test how mobile-friendly the page is on https://testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-in Is Mobile-Friendliness a Ranking Signal? Yes. Since April 21st, 2015, Google started expanding its use of mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal. Mobile-friendliness will continue to remain a ranking factor as AMP also have to be made responsive. Is AMP a Ranking Signal? No, AMP is still not a ranking signal as mentioned by John Mueller, a Google Webmaster Trends Analysts,  in a Google Hangout, at the 15:50 mark into the video. How are Mobile-Friendly Pages and AMP Differentiated and Displayed in Search Results? On November 18th, 2014 Google added a “Mobile-friendly” label to mobile search results. But recently Google announced: To keep search results uncluttered, we’ll be removing the label, although the mobile-friendly criteria will continue to be a ranking signal. Google had introduced AMP as top stories in the carousel for mobile SERPs. In August 2016 Google started sharing an early preview of expanded AMP support across the entire search results page on g.co/ampdemo and not just the “Top stories” section. AMP pages are labeled with the icon  in search results. What About Page Size and Page Load Time? AMP reduces the page size to a great extent as it can be seen in the image below. The number of requests sent to retrieve the page is also less. AMP improves CTR and also shows an increase in the number of repeat visits. The Washington Post’s Jarrod Dicker, head of ad products and technology, said AMP improves click-through rates by up to 50 percent. He also said, The Post publishes over 1,000 articles in AMP every day, and they’re already seeing concrete benefits…We have seen load times average 400 milliseconds, an 88% improvement over our traditional mobile website. This has made readers more likely to tap on Washington Post stories because they know our articles will load consistently fast. AMP has been great for retention as well. Traditionally 51% of mobile search users return to The Washington Post within seven days. For users who read stories published in AMP, this number jumps to 63%. Here’s an example of a performance test conducted of a mobile-friendly version of the page and the AMP page of the same URL: Performance Summary Of a Responsive Page Performance Summary Of the AMP version of the same URL Does Google Give Reports Regarding AMP and Mobile-friendliness in Search Console and Analytics? Yes, Google gives a Mobile Usability Report in the search console for issues regarding mobile-friendliness/responsiveness under Search Traffic. The AMP related issues are also shared in the Search Console under Search Appearance. Google Analytics can also be added to AMP.   Google says since they started working on this mobile experience for users, they have seen an incredible global adoption of AMP that has gone beyond the news industry to include e-commerce, entertainment, travel, recipe sites and so on. To date, there are more than 150 million AMP docs in the Google index, with over 4 million new ones being added every week.  As the number of searches from mobile handsets continues to increase at a massive rate, AMP has become more and more important for search marketers.   Image Credits Featured Image: DepositPhotos.com Screenshots Taken by Author 9/2016 Related Posts Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMPs) Now Indexed in Organic Search Results Accelerated Mobile Pages or Apps?

Apple is much better at getting devices upgraded consistently than Google is, so reviewing it is a little different than other operating systems like Android, Windows, or even macOS. When you read those reviews, the question is "Do I want to install this thing?" When you read an iOS review, the question is "What am I in for now?" What you're in for (and what many of you are already experiencing) is an evolution of some of the design and interaction ideas that Apple has been working on for a couple of years now. iOS 10 moves some of your stuff around a little and makes other stuff look a little different, but fundamentally it acts very much like what you're used to underneath those new notification bubbles and 3D Touch gimmicks. But layered underneath those cosmetic changes are some features that push your apps even further, beyond just their icons, into various corners of the operating system. It's easy to look down your nose at Widgets and iMessage stickers, but when they’re combined with extensions, you begin to see a system where you have access to information from ESPN, Weather, Uber, and much more, all without opening those apps at all. It’s like Android’s widgets, but with a developer ecosystem that might actually be incentivized to support them. Read next: iPhone 7 review Apple Watch Series 2 review When you do open Apple's core apps, you'll find it's a mixed bag. Some, like Mail, have had the bare minimum applied to them, but seeing what Apple has focused on is telling. The biggest changes come to iMessage, Photos, Music, Maps, and News: activities that are all more central to how we use our phones now than ever before. Put the changes inside those apps together with the way any app can express itself outside the confines of its icon, and a picture begins to finally come into focus. We’ve always known that Apple thinks iOS is the future of how computers should work, and with iOS 10 it’s starting to become more than just a promise. Lock screen and notifications When we first tried out the iOS 10 Beta, it was the lock screen's new changes that impressed us most. In iOS 10, Apple has eliminated the Slide to Unlock feature that was one of the defining (and heavily litigated) features of iPhones since they were first announced. Instead, you'll use Touch ID and press the home button to unlock. It's different, and it takes a little getting used to. The screen wakes up as soon as you lift your phone up, showing your notifications straight away. To unlock, you press the home button. But here's a pro tip to try if you don't like it: dig into settings under General -> Accessibility -> Home Button and toggle "Rest Finger to Open." That lets you unlock the phone without pressing in on the button itself. It’s a nice half step between the old swipe-to-unlock and the new way, and if you’re like me, it will make a little more sense. Think of it like the iPhone equivalent of refusing to switch to natural scrolling. But the bigger change to the lock screen is how it handles notifications: they've been overhauled all over the OS, and the lock screen gets those benefits. They look different now — they're discrete bubbles — but more importantly, developers can make "Rich notifications" that allow certain apps to basically embed themselves in a notification. 3D Touch down on a notification and tap reply on an iMessage, for example, and instead of just getting a reply box, it pops up a view of your conversation so you can better reply in context. Calendar shows you a view of your day when you get a meeting reminder. Maps shows, well, a map. It's all really smart and keeps you from playing the classic home button to home screen to app and then back again game every iPhone owner is so familiar with. Not so smart: Apple still hasn't figured out that these interactions ought to be consistent. On the lock screen, you swipe left on a notification to open an app. On the notification shade, you just tap — swiping brings up the "Today View" with your widgets. When you're scrolling through a giant list of notifications, the two screens look identical, so you will sometimes end up doing the wrong thing. Even though Android doesn't have these little embedded apps in notifications, at least you always know what's going to happen when you swipe on one, no matter where you are. Widgets As for the Today View, it makes much more sense now than it used to. It shows up in three places: the left of the home screen, notification pane, and lock screen. It's a place for you to put all your widgets for weather and news and whatever else, replacing Apple's own half-baked attempts with the old Siri predictive screen. Apple’s own apps have a bunch of widgets ready for use and there are third-party widgets already available, too (because they were there on iOS 9). But they’re easier to find now. One weird bit: third-party widgets have a dark background — possibly because so many were designed for the old, darker widget system. Phone makers have been trying to make widgets a thing since time immemorial (aka Pocket PC 2000), but with limited success. So while I want to say Apple nailed it in iOS 10, I've learned from hard experience that we won't know if these widgets will be used more and supported better than the widgets we've seen for the past 15 years on every mobile platform. When you use 3D Touch on certain app icons, they can also display little widgets. And Control Center also lets you use 3D Touch on the bottom row of icons (which, frustratingly, you cannot change) but not (again, frustratingly) the system toggles on the top. It’s split into two, sometimes three panes. The first is for system controls, the second for audio controls, and the third (if you need it) for smart home controls. I'd say that last panel is a big deal, except the smart home ecosystem is still very far from being a big deal itself yet. But if it ends up mattering, iOS 10 will be ready. Siri Siri now integrates third-party apps — which is really important, but Apple is starting slow. Only a few classes of apps can be controlled by Siri: calls, messaging, payments, photos, ride-sharing apps, some CarPlay systems, and workouts. On my iPhone, Square Cash, LinkedIn, OpenTable, Uber, WhatsApp, and Yelp are all options inside Siri. The fact that Apple is opening up Siri and making the process for app developers transparent is great — even Google hasn't done that yet; its integrations still require direct partnerships with the company. You can find a list of your apps that support Siri deep in settings; so far I've sent some WhatsApp messages and called an UberX. Sending payments and booking restaurants also works, but often the final step has you tapping a button inside Siri to finish the process inside an app (or least, that’s what happened with Square Cash and OpenTable). You still can only use Siri with voice and can’t type at it. I still don’t understand why. Beyond the new app integrations, Siri doesn't seem to have gotten a whole lot smarter than you remember. Apple may have a small lead on Google when it comes to opening up to third-party developers, but it still could use some work turning the messy internet into coherent bits of useful information. So I asked Siri "When are the Emmy Awards on?" And got this useless answer. pic.twitter.com/DymPsVht3M — Walt Mossberg (@waltmossberg) September 18, 2016 iMessage Do you want your messaging conversations to be staid, straightforward interactions of text and images? Well, iMessage can do that, but I'm getting the sense it doesn't want to anymore. Instead, Apple is learning from competing apps like Line, Messenger, and Snapchat by adding a host of new features and capabilities. Most interestingly, iMessage is becoming a platform all its own. There are third-party apps, stickers, crazy confetti effects, and emoji all over the place. You can drag stickers up and slap them on previous messages (which could make you look like a jerk). You can embiggen your texts so they slam on the screen when you send them. You can turn your phone sideways and scribble out notes — then send them with the "invisible ink" option so your recipient has to manually reveal them. You can search for GIFs (but be careful out there) that get your point across. You can draw on photos before you send them. Is it all easy to understand? Hell no, but if we've learned anything from Snapchat, it's that difficult-to-use interfaces are actually a feature, not a bug. The basics are easy, and if you want to go bonkers you can hunt the rest down. Depending on who you're chatting with (and depending on your own proclivities), your chats could become a multimedia nightmare of stickers, drawings, audio clips, GIFs, heart beats, kisses, and laser effects. Or maybe that's a wonderland, not a nightmare. Your call. There are also more full-featured apps in iMessage, but so far color me less than impressed with them. More often than not they open up tiny little app windows instead of feeling like they're integrated inline with your chat. The ones that work best are those that just let you perform a quick, simple task — Walt Mossberg and I traded five bucks with each other via Square Cash and the whole thing just worked from inside the space where the keyboard usually is. For people who don't want all that, there are still benefits to the new iMessage. Links automatically get small previews inside the chat window, for example, and in general the app does feel a little faster than before. Photos, Maps Much has been made of Apple's take on machine learning — it's done locally, on your device, instead of in the cloud as Google does it. In the Photos app, the difference between those two different philosophies is the most stark. Apple Photos tries to analyze everything and present you with many of the same features that we've seen on other, cloud-based platforms: robust search based on image analysis and "Memories" that show you old photos from a year or three ago. In both cases, I'm impressed with what Apple is able to do without leaning on a server farm, but not so much that I'd say it's on par with Google Photos. Searches for things like "whiteboard" and "cat" bring up results, but with a higher error rate on what it shows and a miss count on stuff it should have compared to Google. It could be that I need to give Photos yet more time to analyze my library. I'm more impressed with Apple's photo editing tools in iOS 10. They won't hold up to some of the more professional apps out there, but Apple has done good work taking complex photo editing concepts and abstracting them down into simple sliders like "brilliance." Another nice touch: iOS 10 maintains Live Photos even after you've edited them, which means you can retouch your little movies before you make a GIF in Google's Motion Stills app. Speaking of places where Apple and Google go head-to-head, Apple Maps has also been overhauled in iOS 10, and for the better. Apple has put a slider on top of the map canvas, on the bottom, and generally cleaned up the way it displays pins and locations on the map itself. The navigation view is also better and allows you to search along the route — and the CarPlay navigation view is a little more robust now, too. It can connect to restaurant apps and ride-sharing apps, a feature that has quickly gone from "hey neat" to must-have. Is it enough to take Google Maps off my home screen? Nope, but it's getting close. Google's biggest advantage now is that it's the de facto standard across the rest of the computing world. Having a good web app will do that — and though I know it's a pipe dream, I wonder what would happen if Apple decided to take a year off from making iOS and Mac apps and ported more of its suite to the web. I know, I know: what a nutty idea. Music Apple Music has been overhauled in iOS 10, entirely for the better. The "Connect" tab, a little feed of content from your favorite artists, has been sent off to live with Ping on the island of forgotten Apple social ideas. More importantly, the overall navigation and organization of the app has been clarified and cleaned up. Like Spotify, Apple Music is trying to be at least two things at once: a place to navigate your own music library and a place to discover new music via a subscription service. I don't think either has fully figured out how to square that circle, but the latest version of Apple Music is getting close to being on par. I still prefer Spotify myself, mainly because it seems to offer me better new music than Apple does. But Spotify is apparently going to be missing out on Apple Music exclusives on the regular, which could drive people to switch. The new "Now Playing" screen is also simplified, just don't forget to scroll up a bit to get options like lyrics and the shuffle / repeat buttons. Other Apps Apple News continues to exist, now with breaking news notifications from key partners (Disclosure! The Verge and Vox Media are partners in Apple News). I could see somebody using this instead of Flipboard or an RSS reader, but I can't see enough people using it to make it a Facebook-style force in the news industry. It's there, it's fine. Speaking of fine: Apple Mail. I'm elated that it finally does a decent job threading emails into a single, scrollable pane of messages. I'm less elated by everything that hasn't been updated. I couldn't imagine using a mail client that doesn't offer a "snooze" function anymore, and there are too many good options out there that offer it to consider sticking with Apple Mail. But hey! You can delete it and many other core Apple apps. But before you go deleting, know that all you're really doing is cleaning up your home screen. Apple says that "removing built-in iOS apps doesn't free up storage space on your device." And even if you delete an app like Mail, it doesn't mean you can set up another one to fully replace it. Delete Mail and then tap an email address — the iPhone pops up a warning telling you to reinstall Mail. Still a walled garden, but with more doors Last year, a few of the newest 3D Touch iOS features were limited to the iPhone 6S. This year, you don’t need to upgrade to an iPhone 7 to try out the new stuff — and even people with older phones have some workarounds to get to the 3D Touch-enabled functions. As Joanna Stern said over at The Wall Street Journal, it’s enough that you don’t really need that new phone. With iOS 10, you can clearly see that Apple understands what it wants a phone to be in 2016. You can see that vision when it chose to update its own apps. It's the thing we use to talk to each other, to take pictures, to listen to music, and to find our way around. But it can also be so much more, and so Apple has expanded the platform, giving us tiny windows into those apps all over the OS. It's not quite the productivity powerhouse (especially on the iPad) that some would like, but it's very much Apple's vision of computing. More apps in more places iOS 10 offers more places than ever for apps: iMessage, Siri, Extensions, Maps, CarPlay, Widgets, and 3D Touch Widgets. But this is still Apple, and it is still precious about making its own stuff the default. Which is its right, but with so many other options available for developers, it's weird (and frustrating) to see Apple hold out on those last few things, like default apps. At their best, operating systems are platforms for other apps and services to build on instead of collections of apps made by a single company. And Apple has done that with iOS 10, just in its own way. Sure, it will take a while for your favorite apps to take advantage of the new features (if they ever do so at all), but if developers are smart, they'll be thinking about those new canvases. Because now, nobody can reasonably complain that the iPhone’s software is a boring old "73 degrees and sunny" anymore.

Search Watch Live Home UK World Business Politics Technology Entertainment Strange News Weather Driverless cars: What have vehicle manufacturers done so far? Apple is not the only firm trying to develop self-piloted technology - Tesla, Ford and Uber are also working on models. 15:21, UK, Thursday 22 September 2016 Image Caption: Tesla has been one of the pioneers of driverless technology Twitter Share on Twitter Facebook Share on Facebook Google+ Share on Google+ Whats App Share on Whatsapp Mail Share by email Tom Cheshire Technology Correspondent Twitter Follow Tom Driverless, electric cars - everybody wants some. So what are different companies up to? :: TESLA Tesla beat many of its rivals to the road with semi-autonomous driving - its autopilot feature lets the car take control on motorways (although drivers are meant to keep their hands on the wheels). However, the death of one Tesla owner in the US and another in China has raised consumer doubts. Chief executive Elon Musk, whose middle name may well be "hype", says that autonomous driving is a "solved problem" and that full driverless cars are just two years away. Image Caption: Ford's driverless technology fitted to a Mondeo :: FORD Ford ushered in the last automotive revolution, with its vast assembly lines making cars affordable for the middle classes. And that is an important point: for driverless cars to take off now, they are going to have to be mass-market. That is a capability Google and Tesla do not have right now. In September, Ford demonstrated its own autonomous vehicle on a public road in Michigan. The company said it anticipated a future where people do not own cars, but share them. A full production line self-driving car - without steering wheel or an accelerator - is promised by 2021. Image Caption: Volvo has been working with Uber on driverless technology :: VOLVO While tech companies have been making a lot of noise about their plans, Volvo, in quiet, Scandinavian fashion, has actually been getting on with it. From 2014, five autonomous cars have been pootling around Gothenburg. Next year, that number will be upped to 100, and afterwards a similar trial will be launched in London - and it has joined forces with Uber in a "longer term industrial partnership". Image Caption: Baidu's prototype driverless system on a BMW in China :: BAIDU Baidu is the Chinese equivalent of Google - a search engine company that has a huge presence. And it also wants to bring driverless cars to China, as a part of a public shuttle service by 2018, with mass production by 2020. But it also has a permit to test its vehicles in Google's own backyard - California.  Image Caption: Uber has unveiled its own driverless adaptation of a Ford car :: UBER The most ruthless company in the whole of tech is staying true to form when it comes to driverless cars. Uber relies on a thousands of drivers for its cheap labour; next it wants to replace them with robots. The taxi-app company made a partnership with Carnegie Mellon, probably the academic centre for driverless cars, then poached all its staff. In September, it unveiled its own vehicle in Pittsburgh, a version of a Ford, alongside its Volvo partnership. Image Caption: British company Oxbotica is developing driverless technology in Oxford :: OXBOTICA It is not just tech behemoths and auto giants: there is a plucky British approach too. Oxbotica is a spin out from Oxford University. Its RobotCar is the first autonomous car approved for public roads, and its vehicles will soon scoot around Milton Keynes and Greenwich, in London.  Jaguar Land Rover will put a fleet of 100 autonomous vehicles onto UK roads by 2020. Image Caption: Google's driverless project has involved creating a car as well as the technology :: GOOGLE Google kickstarted this whole thing, with their autonomous cars very publicly motoring around Silicon Valley. The company has always been happy developing technology in full view, even when it does not work out - Google glass. Its latest design has also been the most radical reimagining of the automobile - a pod without pedals, just a button to push. Google's strategy will be interesting: would it manufacture the cars themselves, or license its technology, as it does with its Android operating system?  It recently partnered with Fiat Chrysler to develop a self-driving people-mover. Image Caption: McLaren, the supercar manufacturer, is understood to have been approached by Apple :: APPLE Apple's not-so-secret electric car project, codenamed Titan, has been in the works for two years. But according to reports it has suffered some growing pains. In September, the New York Times reported it was rebooting its strategy on self-driving cars, sacking dozens of employees. Earlier this year, Apple invested $1bn in Didi Chuxing, the Chinese equivalent of Uber. Image Caption: Audi's RS7 piloted driving concept car :: THE REST For a market that does not exist yet, driverless cars are a crowded sector. Last year, Audi, BMW and Daimler bought Nokia's mapping unit, called HERE, in a deal worth $2.7bn. Microsoft has a partnership with Toyota and General Motors has invested $500m in Lyft, the Uber rival. And BMW is working with Intel on autonomous vehicles.

But Google, after promising the app will keep privacy in mind has backtracked on it stating that the servers need to store data longer for the machine learning to work. Now, champion of privacy Edward Snowden is warning users against downloading the Allo messaging app alleging the app to be the tool Google is using for mass surveillance. In a series of tweets posted last night, Snowden explained the privacy issues regarding the app. As the app is powered by AI, it needs access to more information about the user to revert with intuitive and accurate replies. To make use of the smart reply feature of Allo, the app needs access to sensitive information to give relevant responses. And regarding this, Snowden points out that Google will keep a record of every word, image, location and other personal information that users share on the app. The Verge reported yesterday the all information shared on the Allo app will now be accessible to lawful requests, similar to Gmail, Hangouts and location data collected by Google can be given to law enforcement authorities upon producing a warrant. Allo will log all information, except those shared over the incognito mode to improve its AI assistance. This is opposed to Google's earlier promise that data will only stored for a transient period of time and in non-identifiable form. But then Google backtracked and admitted it will be keeping all records until the user manually deletes them or use the incognito mode. But all said and done, whatever data Allo will collect about you, chances are, Google already has a lot more information about you anyway. Just head to the 'My Activity' dashboard in your Google profile to check for yourself. The dashboard shows every location you have been, everything you have asked Google to search using your voice and text. So it would hardly matter anyway. If you still aren't convinced, Snowden says WhatsApp with its end-to-end encryption and private messaging app Signal are better alternative to protect yourself from Big Brother.

It sports features commonly found in messaging apps and includes a built-in Assistant, Google’s conversational artificial intelligence helper, an Incognito mode and more. While Google originally promised Allo would only store messages transiently and in non-identifiable form, the firm’s had a change of heart as Allo logs all chats by default. Google Allo offers features like stickers, smart canned responses, the ability to change the size of your text in chats, a private-messaging mode, Google Assistant and more. Here are a few highlights: Smart Reply—Respond to messages without typing a single word. Smart Reply learns over time and suggests responses to text and photos, in your style. Stickers—Say it all with the perfect sticker. Stickers in Google Allo are designed by independent artists and studios from around the world. SHOUT or whisper—No more typing in ALL CAPS to get your point across. Say it louder or quieter by changing the size of your text with a quick swipe. Incognito mode—Send messages with end-to-end encryption, use private notifications to help keep your chats more discreet, and control how long your messages stick around with expiring chats. Assistant lets you do things like book a dinner reservation, look up sports scores, settle a bet, play a game and more. Akin to the features available in Google’s Gboard iPhone keyboard, the assistant integrates with Search, Maps, YouTube and Translate. Just add @google to your group conversation or chat one-on-one with your Assistant. Check out the Allo teaser video. Google Assistant built into Allo is currently a preview version. Over the months, Assistant will make its way into other Google products. By the way, Assistant is initially available in English, with more languages coming soon. Google offers some examples how Assistant might be helpful in Allo: Make plans with friends—You can easily move from discussing dinner with friends to making plans for the night, right in your chat. Just add the Assistant to your group chat and ask for movie times, local restaurants and more. You can also research travel destinations, flights and hotels together with friends. Get answers—Get the latest info on everything from news, weather, traffic, sports, or your upcoming flights status. Ask the Assistant to send you daily updates on the information you care about. Have some fun—Ask your Assistant to share that funny YouTube video or play games with friends right in your group chat — for instance you can compete to guess a movie title based on a series of emojis. According to Russell Brandom of The Verge, Allo logs all chats by default and the records persist until you actively delete them, basically giving Google default access to a full history of conversations in the app. Brandon explains: According to Google, the change was made to improve the Allo assistant’s smart reply feature, which generates suggested responses to a given conversation. Like most machine learning systems, the smart replies work better with more data. As the Allo team tested those replies, they decided the performance boost from permanently stored messages was worth giving up privacy benefits of transient storage. You can avoid the logging by using Allo’s Incognito mode, which enables end-to-end encryption and makes notifications more discreet. As mentioned, both Google Assistant and the Smart Reply feature are currently available in English only. Allo is available for both iOS and Android. Grab Google Duo in the App Store at no charge.

Jamessmooth My exact thought reading this. Prasoon Singh Like why would you use a messaging app know that your chats are being logged? nirmitlamed If you have facebook it shouldn’t bother you so much. Arcendus Because I don’t do illegal shit, and I’m not a celebrity, so it makes no difference to me. Alex Mayer I don’t see a reason not to use this app since over 1 BILLION people use Facebook. Alex Mayer In your dreams. Only Criminal s like you woukd stay away. Figures!!! Tony Trenkle Jr. Yesterday I was having trouble with signing into the app. It said to enter in a verification code and when I did it said it was incorrect. Havent tried today yet. Anyone else have that issue? Christian Zibreg Worked for me on first try 9C1 Yeah…. No thanks. Jack Wong So, does this replace the Hangout? :D This is gonna flop edwilk55 “Do No Harm”… pu’leaaaase. SMH! Agneev Mukherjee I love the UI already… therealjjohnson Yeah, looks like iMessage. nirmitlamed Google forgot to add Beta after the app name. For official version that came from big company that isn’t its first messaging app, this is very sad that this is the outcome. DOA! Rowan09 Google is the only company that could have so many flops, but yet not labeled as a “doomed” company like Apple is labeled constantly. Google plus was an epic fail, Glass failed, Hangouts failed, the modular phone they previewed never even made it to market, etc. They tell everyone about all their internal projects and usually they fail before release or right after release. iMessage on IOS 10 has basically all the features of Allo, plus more and it can’t compete with Facebook Messenger. This in my opinion is another failed attempted by Google, but time will tell. John Smith The reason behind this is because Google lets the public know of all their ongoing projects, whether they’re finished or not. Apple, on the other hand, is very secretive, with very little information ever leaving their Campus. Apple’s had their fair share of failed projects, which is why you don’t hear that much anymore. Their original planned tablet from 2001, their iTunes phone, rumored car project which is now on pause. Google’s grown the tolerance as a company that tries new things, Apple’s set a reputation of a perfectionist company, which in effect set high standards. Rowan09 Yes a lot of Apple’s failed projects were not released, Google keep putting out failed products over and over again when their only interest is advertising not hardware. I understand but everyone tries new things in house, but when you let the world in on it you should at some point get blasted. george Apple is failing so hard that they haven’t released a new product since the Apple watch which is an ugly ass watch. Rowan09 Lol. Failing? Who is winning? george By shitting out the same product every year? Rowan09 I asked a question who is winning? John Smith Charlie Sheen. Rowan09 You sir was right, before he announced he had HIV. Arcendus Who knows? And more importantly who cares? Rowan09 Apparently George. therealjjohnson Since the Apple watch…its been little over a year since the apple watch came out lol george Yeah and how many years before that? B please. therealjjohnson You’re the one that used that as an example, not me. I don’t even know why you’re talking about Apple releasing hardware when this is about another possible failed attempt by google at releasing software. Why are you even making this comparison? Rowan09 I’m waiting on an answer? BoghosAvetikian didn’t Google Glass essentially become Android Wear? Rowan09 No. Google Glass I believe is still being worked on. The first version was a failure and personally I believe it’s for specialized fields not every consumer. Alex-V Not in germany 5723alex . Edward Snowden : What is #Allo? A Google app that records every message you ever send and makes it available to police upon request. Free for download today: Google Mail, Google Maps, and Google Surveillance. That’s #Allo. Don’t use Allo. Christopher Carr Meh — Snowden would have us all live in a paranoid neckbeard OPSEC world: booting a non-persistent Tails distro installation off a thumb drive for all computing needs, and saving everything to a separate, quantum-resistant encrypted drive, to be stored up one’s arse when not in use; TOR and VPNs of course; communicating via One Time Pad chat apps, etc. 😉 I kid Ed. Good guy. But most of us aren’t that important — I don’t care if Google stores my chats. And there’s always the end-to-end encrypted Incognito Mode … or Telegram or whatever, if you need it. diggitydang Do they log chats in Facebook Messenger, Hangouts, Whatsapp, and/or other messaging apps? Also, based on Snowden’s comments, does that mean I should cancel Gmail and Google Maps too? I know they track the places I’ve been and what I wrote in emails.

But the app's reliance on Google's predictive software drew immediate criticism from privacy advocates who argued it could open up user data to law enforcement - with former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden warning people not to use it. Google defended its privacy stand, saying users can opt for a more secure "incognito" mode if they prefer. The app includes Google Assistant, an artificial intelligence programme which makes live suggestions as you chat. “Google Allo can help you make plans, find information, and express yourself more easily in chat. And the more you use it, the more it improves over time,” Google said. Privacy, encryption Conversations in Allo will be encrypted, according to Google. And additional privacy will be offered with an “incognito” option in which messages will disappear after a fixed period. But some analysts expressed disappointment that Google did not go further in agreeing not to store messages on its servers, where they can be accessed by authorities. Christopher Soghioan, a privacy researcher with the American Civil Liberties Union, lamented that Google "decided that improving auto responses was worth making all messages accessible to law enforcement". Snowden, the former US intelligence contractor wanted for leaking National Security Agency documents on surveillance, said in a tweet, "Don't use Allo." A later tweet from Snowden called Allo an "app that records every message you ever send and makes it available to police upon request". Google argues that the "smart" features of the application require "data processing" and that the tech giant needs to store chats to improve responses. "We've given users transparency and control over their data in Google Allo," a Google statement emailed to AFP said.

The Post and Courier of Charleston reports (http://bit.ly/2cNsGwz ) Google has applied to draw 1.5 million gallons of water a day from the aquifer to cool servers in Berkeley County. Mount Pleasant Town Councilman Mark Smith calls the plan a threat to public health. The town of 80,000 draws about 3.5 million gallons of water a day from the aquifer, a reservoir of fresh water about 1,600 feet underground. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control is reviewing the Google application. Google issued a statement saying it will work with the community. Smith called using the waters to cool the servers "a colossal waste of our valuable resources and is a threat to public health and safety." Clay Duffie, the general manager of Mount Pleasant Waterworks, said the town draws from the aquifer for most of its water, an average of 5.5 million gallons daily. Some water is purchased from the Charleston Water System which relies on surface water. Duffie said the town buys that water, in part, to reduce pressure on the aquifer.. "Instead of pumping more and more, we started pumping less, so that we could sustain that aquifer," he said. The waterworks has asked state regulators to hold off on the application until Google analyzes alternatives. "We evaluated various water options and invested in researching the impact that groundwater withdrawal would have on the community and the environment," Google said in a statement issued Wednesday. "Data from our groundwater consultants indicate that impact to the aquifer and the community is expected to be minimal." The internet giant first located in Berkeley County eight years ago. ___ Information from: The Post and Courier, http://www.postandcourier.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

It is the same thing that Google had announced. It looks good design wise, is simple enough to use and is fun with the smart virtual Assistant inbuilt in it proving particular popular with the people. But it also comes without the promise that Google had made in May. It takes a step back on the privacy compared to what Google originally said. Google's promise with Allo was that the messages exchanged on the app will be encrypted end-to-end and that Google will delete with them from its servers after the messages have been delivered to users. But that is a promise Google breaks. The Allo app that has been released does not offer end-to-end encryption in regular chats (although in incognito mode it does) and saves all the messages on Google servers indefinitely. Also Read: Google Allo vs WhatsApp: How they are similar, how they are different This is the reason why Allo has received thumbs down from Edward Snowden, a privacy advocate who made headlines for leaking crucial NSA information in 2013. Snowden has accused Google for spying on users through Allo by calling it a free "Google surveillance app". He claims that Allo records every message and can make it available to police if asked for. The ex-CIA contractor also claims that Allo is basically an app which records every message you ever send and can pass it on to the police if asked for.  He has recommended his favourite Signal app over the Allo. What is #Allo? A Google app that records every message you ever send and makes it available to police upon request. https://t.co/EdPRC0G7Pyâ€” Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016 In seriousness, this is a complex question for which there is no one right answer. But relative to #Allo, Signal is safer for normal users.â€” Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016 Google's broken promise There is no doubt that Google is backtracking on the privacy issue when it comes to Allo. It had promised something else in May and it is delivering something else. But according to Google, there is a reason for that and that reasons is its desire to make Allo smart. This is also a reason that is correct although top say that this is the only reason why Google is going to store and remember the user chats is disingenuous. It is also true that Google needs to collect, store and the analyse data to understand users better so that it can serve the better ads to people. Google is saying that it is going to store user messages because the information contained in them will make Allo smarter. For example, it will help it find out what users like and what they don't, what sort of language they use. All of this can be then used to suggest more contextual and useful suggestions by the Google's virtual assistant that is inbuilt in Allo. Also Read: Allo is smart but its missing features make Google look dumb Allo is basically an AI-based app and AI is an information-hungry software. To be fast and more intuitive it requires more and more information about the user. The best application of this can is seen the app's smart reply feature. User cannot type the reply, instead are given smart reply options by Google AI. These replies are basically generated from the history of the user that includes all the Google services that they have ever used like mails, news, apps etc. At the same time, the company says that people who need more privacy should use the incognito mode in Allo. what is this incognito mode? Here is how Google explains it: "Privacy and security are important in messaging, so following in the footsteps of Chrome, we created Incognito mode in Allo. Chats in Incognito mode will have end-to-end encryption and discreet notifications, and we'll continue to add new features to this mode." The incognito mode also allows users to expiry time for their messages. Once the set time is over, the messages will vanish. How others do it While a few other instant messaging apps like Facebook Messenger take a privacy approach that is similar to that of Allo, there are some, including WhatsApp, that do better. These are: WhatsApp:  WhatsApp promises end-to-end encryption provided the app on the both ends are of the latest version. However, recently the company updated its privacy policy and said that it would share the phone number of a user with Facebook, which is the parent company of WhatsApp. Telegram: This is a cloud-based app which stores data like messages, photos, videos and documents on its servers. Although chats are encrypted, the company says that it stores data so that user can access their data from any of their devices anytime. Signal:  The app says that it offers seamless end-to end encrypted calling and messaging service for its users. It is considered one of the most secure chat apps and is used by Snowden.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Micromax to launch four 4G smartphones with Google Duo Ahead of the festive season, handset maker Micromax will launch four 4G smartphones, priced under USD 100 (about Rs 5,700), to cash in on the booming demand for LTE devices. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Ahead of the festive season, handset maker Micromax will launch four 4G smartphones, priced under USD 100 (about Rs 5,700), to cash in on the booming demand for LTE devices. Micromax has partnered Google to preload the latter's video calling app, Duo, on all the 4 smartphones. "Video calling is perceived to be a very urban phenomenon and niche but at Micromax, we believe that there is a huge potential to massify the service by taking it beyond the tier 1 markets where Micromax has an unmatched edge," Micromax co-founder Vikas Jain told PTI. The 'video series' will help millions of users discover the Duo app and will be a volume driver for Micromax in the festive season, he added. Sales of 4G handsets have grown significantly in India as operators expand their high-speed Internet services (4G LTE) networks in the country. According to analysts, the trend will gain further momentum with the launch of Reliance Jio's service that is offering free voice calling and cheap data rates to consumers. According to research firm IDC, 4G smartphones shipments stood at 15.4 million units in January-March 2016 quarter, registering a growth of more than 6 times over the same period last year. "The collaboration with Google Duo is extremely important. Users will find Duo easy to latch on to Duo's simple interface...all the 4 phones will be sub-USD 100," he said. Last month, Google launched Duo for Android and iOS users that competes with apps like FaceTime and Skype. The video calling app, first announced by Google at its I/O developer conference earlier this year, aims to take the "complexity out of video calling". "In the first month alone we have seen over 10 million downloads, with US and India being among the top countries," Google Group Product Manager Amit Fulay said. Duo allows users to connect using their phone number without a separate username/account. Google also introduced a new feature 'Knock Knock' that allows people to see live video of the caller before they answer, helping users connect with the person even before they pick up. "Duo has been built to be fast and reliable, so that video calls connect quickly and work well even on slower networks, something that we think is relevant for the Indian market," Fulay said.

Picture: John Devlin/TSPL Chris McCall 12:33 Thursday 22 September 2016 3 Have your say Thousands of small businesses in Scotland are failing to take advantage of digital opportunities for growth, a senior Google executive has warned. Peter Barron, the tech giant’s head of communications in Europe, said no firm could afford not to have an online presence in 2016. The Digital Garage will be in Mitchell Library until January. Picture: John Devlin/TSPL Too many companies are relying on badly designed websites and failing to engage customers on social media, the former BBC Newsnight editor told The Scotsman. “There’s an urgent need to improve right across the board - whether it’s a guy selling waffles from a stand, or a kid that needs to learn coding as part of his aeronautical engineering degree,” he said. “There are thousands of small businesses across Scotland that are not taking full advantage of digital opportunities. We see when a business becomes web enabled, it grows at twice the speed and highers twice as many people as it competitors. “Scotland is a huge tourist destination. Being able to advertise your bed and breakfast or restaurant to a global audience is vitally important.” Barron was in Glasgow this week to launch Google’s latest Digital Garage - a free drop-in centre which offers practical advice to small businesses and start-ups on how to improve their online prescence. The pop-up facility will be based in the Mitchell Library until January. Google said 88 per cent of businesses involved in previous digital garage events have changed the way they run or promote their business online, with 68 per cent saying they had seen positive results. Run in partnership with Glasgow City Council, the digital garage will also host training events for charities and computing lessons for local students and teachers.

If you talk to people who have been through the Digital Garage, they’ll often tell you they had a website - but they weren’t really using it, it was terribly designed and didn’t engage with customers. “That’s really what the Digital Garage is doing - it’s bringing small businesses up to speed in how best to use avaialble tools.” With an ever increasing number of people browsing the internet via smartphones, a website which is slow to load or fails to display properly is likely to deterr customers. But Barron believes a bigger problem is the number of small-to-medium firms which lack any identifable web prescene at all. “It’s the same issue across Europe,” he added. “Many small businesses think they don’t need to be online. “A builder or a plumber, for example, might not think of themselves as being a digital business. “But the truth is, if I was looking for an emergency in Glasgow, I’m clearly going to look online. You need that presence. Every business needs to be a digital business. “This project focuses on small businesses but the digital skills gap applies right across the board. “We need more kids learning coding in schools and feeding through to the high-tech companies of the future. “In the next few years, 90 per cent of businesses in Britain are going to require digital skills.” READ MORE: Edinburgh students bringing solar power to refugees Back to the top of the page Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

The first product from the boldly named Turing Robotic Industries, it was announced last year in a blaze of publicity, and at the time was claimed to be hacker-resistant and practically indestructible thanks to its "liquid morphium" construction. Related: Best Android phones Pre-orders opened and plenty of people laid down their money in the expectation that they'd have this innovative Android device in their hands by the end of the year, but that didn't come to pass. Android was ditched in favour of the more secure – but less well-known – Sailfish OS from Finnish firm Jolla, and a series of delays pushed the release into 2016. At the time of writing, the "final" device still isn't out. Instead, buyers are being sent "evaluation" units that lack the promised waterproof coating and boast a very basic, untouched version of Sailfish 2.0, without Turing's much-hyped "Imitation Key" end-to-end encryption system enabled. The downside for the consumers who have stuck with the company thus far is effectively having to make do with an unfinished prototype of the phone they paid hundreds of pounds for last year. On the upside, these units are being provided free of charge, and the final phone – expected at the end of 2016 – will pack a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor. Those two points should certainly help soften the blow. Related: Best budget phones One of the big selling points of the Turing Phone is the fact that it's constructed from an extremely tough "liquid metal" material which, it's claimed, is stronger than titanium and incredibly scratch-resistant. Footage of a high-pressure bend test appears to support this stance, and when taking the phone out of its stunningly lavish box, the first thing that struck me was the sheer weight of it; this device has some serious heft to it. With dimensions of 151.8 x 77.1 x 9mm, it's quite a large handset, but the fact that the 5.5-inch screen has very thin bezels means that it isn't as enormous as some of its rivals. The design of the Turing Phone is sure to turn heads. The rounded edges and curves that are so popular in the sphere of smartphones are nowhere to be seen. Instead, the device is a combination of straight lines and sharp corners, making it look like something from a science-fiction movie. On the rear the Turing Phone sports a scale-like texture, which alludes to the "Dark Wyvern" branding of this particular edition. The guys at Turing are clearly heavily into fantasy and sci-fi, as another Dark Wyvern version is planned subtitled "Glaedr", which literary buffs will know is the name of one of the dragons in Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle of fantasy novels. Another – the "Cardinal" – takes inspiration from the classic Japanese anime series Mobile Suit Gundam. Each will have a slightly different texture on the rear panel, making the designs unique from one another. This particular Dark Wyvern model mixes gold and black to good effect, creating a device that looks like a premium proposition. While it might not be to everyone's tastes, I have to admit I've fallen a little in love with the unique aesthetics of this device, partly because I've been craving a handset that looks a little different after years of "me too" designs from the likes of HTC, Samsung and Apple – and this certainly looks different. On the left-hand side of the Turing Phone you'll find a fingerprint scanner, which also acts as a screen lock and home button of sorts. However, Sailfish doesn't currently support such tech and Turing is hard at work creating its own workaround – a regrettable consequence of switching your OS towards the end of production. Along the bottom edge sits a mono speaker and Wallaby MagStream port – the latter being a magnetic connection for charging and data transfer. Turing claims this choice of connection is based on security, as is the complete absence of a 3.5mm audio socket. Just like the iPhone 7. Such ports make the device vulnerable to hackers, according to the manufacturer, and this means that out of the box there's no current means of listening to audio via headphones. Turing is working on its own Bluetooth headset, which will be mailed out to buyers as soon as possible and sold with the final production model later this year – but if you have your own pair of wireless cans then they should work just fine. The Turing Phone's 5.5-inch screen has a Full HD resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels and is sharp enough for my liking. While Samsung and other handset makers continue to push displays with higher pixel counts, they strike me as largely pointless. After all, if it's impossible to make out individual pixels on a 1080p screen, why bother adding more when the only noticeable effect is likely to be an increased load on the processor? 1080p is perfectly fine for a screen of this size – and the other good news is that Turing's device is equipped with a decent panel that boasts good colour depth, brightness and contrast. When the Turing Phone was announced back in mid-2015, the fact that it was powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 801 turned a few heads; the processor had already been surpassed in terms of power at that time. Fast forward a year and it's positively archaic. But the good news is that the final version of the phone will have the more up-to-date Snapdragon 820. Also, 3GB of RAM is included – an entry-level amount for most flagships these days – while all evaluation units come with 128GB of internal storage. Performance-wise, the Snapdragon 801 is really beginning to show its age. While the Turing Phone is nippy enough when it comes to everyday activities such as texting, web browsing and general navigation, it struggles with more intense tasks such as 3D gaming. I also noticed that the built-in email client stuttered frequently when browsing through my Google Mail account. It's worth noting that the software is still being optimised at present and there's every chance that a future OTA will clear up some of these niggles – and it's obvious that the introduction of the newer Snapdragon chip will boost overall performance. Given Android's security weaknesses it's understandable that Turing would seek an alternative OS for its devices, and Sailfish is perhaps the only genuine option out there right now. Since it's based on Linux, it can run Android apps with no discernable performance issues, and the phone even comes pre-loaded with an app store that offers thousands of free-to-download Android apps. It's a good job, because at the time of writing, Sailfish's own download repository is criminally low on content, lacking official apps for many of the big social networks and web services. Being able to use Android apps is a real boon, but it comes with some provisos. Those that rely on the Google Play Services framework – such as Gmail and other associated Google downloads – won't run properly on the Turing Phone at the time of writing. An OTA fix is apparently in the works to solve this problem, and should make the phone more appealing for those who rely heavily on Google's suite of apps and services – which, let's admit it, is the majority of smartphone users. Sailfish itself is an interesting OS for those who have spent much of the past decade using an iPhone or Android device. Built from the smoking remains of Nokia's abandoned MeeGo, it focuses on gestures for navigation rather than using the traditional "Home", "Back" and "Menu" arrangement popularised by Google's software. For example, any app can be paused by swiping from the side of the screen, an action that brings up a menu showing your current active applications. Swiping from the bottom of the display opens the app drawer, while swiping from left to right shows your current notifications. When you're in an app, gently swiping downwards opens a pulley menu at the top of the screen with a list of relevant options – this is also present in the dialler, with calls being accepted and rejected with an downward and upwards swipe respectively. The beauty of this system is that you can move around the UI quickly using just a single finger, and navigating between open apps is pretty speedy since they're never more than a right-to-left swipe away at any time. Sailfish boasts support for Google accounts too, so linking the phone with your contacts and email is relatively straightforward. You can also link your Facebook and Twitter accounts so that notifications for these appear in the native UI. Sailfish shows promise, but ultimately, it lacks the flexibility and mature feature sets of iOS and Android – which is hardly surprising, as both of those have had a significant head start. The Turing Phone's UI won't look like this for long, however. As was the intention when the phone pitched as running Android, Turing intends to layer its own user interface skin over the top of Jolla's software. Little is known about the promised "Turing Æmæth UI" at present, but it will undoubtedly unlock the encryption capabilities of the device that will allow Turing users to communicate with one another securely, thanks to robust end-to-end encryption – another key selling point of the phone back at its 2015 reveal. In terms of photography, the Turing Phone comes equipped with a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera and 8-megapixel front-facing snapper. The main rear-facing camera produces detailed shots, and HDR support is apparently included but not enabled in this version of Sailfish. The camera is a little sluggish to boot up but that will presumably change once Turing has layered on its own UI improvements and enhancements. Video capture is also encouraging, with HD recording offering smooth and detail-rich footage. The Turing Phone is offered in three storage options – 16GB, 64GB and 128GB. A microSD memory card slot is present on the SIM card tray so you can add more storage if you wish. Like all other evaluation units, my phone has 128GB of storage – more than enough for all my downloads, photos, videos and music. A 3,000mAh battery is featured, and due to the sealed nature of the phone, it can't be replaced by the end user. Battery life is a difficult one to judge at this moment in time, since the software is still being tinkered with. However, it falls roughly in line with what you'd expect from your typical big-screen smartphone in 2016. The Snapdragon 801 lacks the power-saving enhancements seen in the 820, making it even harder to get an accurate idea of the Turing Phone's stamina, and Turing's ongoing software optimisations will presumably yield superior staying power. First Impressions What Turing has done with this phone is totally unique; it has effectively mailed out pre-production test units to its customers ahead of giving them the (much delayed) end result. The company's critics will no doubt claim this is Turing's way of keeping its customers happy while they wait for the final device – which will be a year overdue by the close of 2016 – but it effectively means that buyers are getting two devices for the price of one. It also means that users will be able to contribute meaningfully to the continued development of the concept by submitting bug reports and feedback, so the final product can be as polished as possible. That's why I've stopped short of giving the Turing Phone a review score here, because it clearly isn't the final product – nor will it be available in stores in this "evaluation" form. For that reason, it would be unfair to review the device as-is. However, I'll be revisiting it towards the end of the year, when the "final" Snapdragon 820 version arrives, complete with water-resistant coating, Bluetooth headset, Turing Æmæth UI and its much-hyped security features in place. On a purely physical level, the Turing Phone really impresses. It looks stunning, feels reassuringly substantial and is fashioned from cutting-edge materials – and while those sharp corners look positively vicious in photos, they've not presented a genuine ergonomic issue for me so far. Digging deeper into the device it's clear that Turing has some work to do before we can really consider this to be the finished article. For the time being, the Turing Phone remains something of an enigma – one that has the potential to change the way we view security on our smartphones, and alter your perception of the way a device such as this should look.

Micheal Shallop November 11, 2016, 6:11 pm The Turing Dark Wyvern evaluation phone isn't a daily-use phone. As it is today, it barely provides phone and IM functionality - and sometimes not even then when transitioning from wifi to cellular. Most of the promised functionality/features weren't included in the evaluation phone. From what I can derive from the FB posts, we're not seeing anything remotely close to the final version of the OS - apparently Turing is working on a proprietary version of the Sailfish OS. Android apps are largely unavailable and since the last Sailfish OS update, the one app I could get working, no longer starts. Turing has posted to the FB page about the subreddit being the official support site but, to-date, not a single post/response from Turing has been seen. Apparently, when they said "support", then meant "community". I think Turing released the phone because customer waited so long, past so many missed dates previously promised. In my case, I received my phone 15 months after Turing accepted my payment. They had to do something, release something, and this was their best version that they could come up with. Unfortunately, the phone is just a couple of steps above two soup-cans and a kite string in terms of contemporary functionality. Hopefully, Turing isn't too focused moving on to the next phone they're babbling about and are still working on delivering what they promised back in 2015.

Because ‘six seconds is more than enough’ Update: DDoS attack on Dyn DNS leaves internet crippled Big Tech / Google / Google Drive gets updated search with autocorrect By Myolisi Sikupela: Staff Reporter on 22 September, 2016 Share Google is the king of search and it’s now bringing its skills to Google Drive. In a new update, Google Drive is getting faster search functionality, complete with New Language Processing (NLP) capabilities. Announcing the update, Josh Smith, Product Manager at Google Drive, pointed out that the engineering of Google Search is coming to Google Drive. “Innovation is critical for business success, so we’re constantly trying to build tools that enable our customers to do more,” Smith said. The update is being rolled out today and will allow Google Drive users to make use of the new search feature and its NLP capabilities. The company explains that new NLP is a new fancy way of saying ‘search like you talk’. According to Google, the new search feature is much faster and easier to use. In addition to natural language processing, Google Drive also has improved autocorrect functionality What this means is that people do not have to use specific words when conducting a search. Phrases like “find my budget spreadsheet from last December” or “show me presentations from Anissa” will now suffice. Google Drive, Google says, is built to understand what the user is looking for. The NLP will also solve spelling errors. There is no doubt that typos are a certainty in life, but search should understand what the user intended to say and now Google Drive does (in theory). The autocorrect feature will assist users when they spell words incorrectly and suggest corrections to the misspelled search term. In addition to these updates, Google has introduced two new features to Google Docs. Users can now split their documents into multiples columns in Google Docs. The other new feature makes it possible for users to save a copy when they open, convert and edit non-Google files in Docs, Sheets and Slides.

Source: Travis Wise via Flickr When taking a step back and looking at a chart of GOOGL over the course of the past few weeks, it becomes clear enough that such a stumble was in the cards no matter what. Traders were just waiting for the right excuse to slam Google. Trouble is, GOOG stock just broke under the proverbial point of no return. Now the odds are high that Google will have to make good on the bearish hints the chart has been dropping since April. Google’s Trouble in the Works for a While The bulls can spin it however they want, but there’s no way they can say GOOG stock isn’t suddenly in a heap of trouble. 10 Stocks You Should Be Ready to Buy at a Moment’s Notice Although shares had managed to use the pivotal 200-day moving average line (green) in early May as a floor and then a pushoff point for a minor rally effort, that didn’t happen on Thursday. On Thursday, GOOG plowed into the 200-day moving average line, then decidedly broke under it on Friday, making a lower low in the process. There’s no technical support left to serve as a floor and help stop the selling. Click to Enlarge Were it just the break below the long-term moving average line, it might be dismissible; all stocks ebb and flow sometimes. It wasn’t just Google’s breakdown below an important moving average line, though. There’s a lot of bearish context to go along with it. One of those contexts is the interplay of all the key moving average lines. It’s a nuance of technical analysis, and a subjective one of that. But it’s telling that all of GOOG’s previously divergent moving average lines are about to converge again … moving in the other direction. This isn’t an unusual scenario for a stock’s major turning points. In this case, the “turn” is a turn from a bullish trend to a bearish one. Another big red flag: Through Wednesday, volume had been light for GOOGL and GOOG stock. The sellers certainly started to come out of the woodwork on Thursday, though. With some long-term profits to protect and a little panic starting to set in, other would-be sellers have every reason to start defensively dumping the stock as well, exacerbating the weakness we’ve already seen. Never even mind the fact that we’ve established a pattern of lower highs since early February. Bottom Line for GOOG Stock As for where this is all going, there’s still one smidgen of near-term hope for fans and owners of GOOGL and GOOG stock — there’s a relatively well established floor around $687. That’s close to where the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line lies, and GOOG has used that area sparingly as support a few times since February. It’s not completely shocking today’s low was also right around that mark. Until Alphabet shares break below that floor, short-sellers can’t afford to assume anything. Click to Enlarge Should the lower edge of that support band break ($685) though, there’s no support again until the stock gets to the $620 area where the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement line is waiting. That’s apt to be the best downside target if the stock continues to deteriorate and pulls under its current floor. AMZN: What You Need to Know About the Paris Pushback The latter looks to be the higher-odds outcome at this point. Of course, Fibonacci retracement lines are only tendencies, and not etched in stone. It’s just as important to look for capitulation days, or high volume selloffs, that untimely suggest the last of those would-be sellers has been flushed out. Ideally, any capitulation and revisit of the Fibonacci line at $620 would happen at the same time, serving up a fantastic buying opportunity. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Lifestyle London Life The gadgets to buy in autumn 2016: from running trackers to selfie drones From selfie drones to superfast electric scooters, Kate Wills has a guide to autumn’s smartest buys Kate Wills Thursday 22 September 2016 11:42 BST The subtle Leaf activity tracker September is a huge month in techland. The IFA — the world’s biggest tech trade show — descended on Berlin in the first week of the month and most companies pick this time of year to announce new or next generation products. Plus, there’s something about back-to-school season that has us itching to upgrade our gadgets. Once we needed a fresh pencil case or the squeak of new shoes to start the season — this autumn calls for shiny new tech. Here’s what you need to kit out your home and office. Picture perfect Get ready for gaming to go to the next level now that the much-hyped virtual reality headset Oculus Rift has just gone on sale in the UK (£549, currys.co.uk). Early indications suggest it won’t disappoint. Read more The smart travel gadgets every tech-savvy jetsetter should own Love gaming? The newly-announced PlayStation 4 Pro (£349, playstation.com) will offer 4K resolution when it comes out on November 10. And for the sharpest set on the block, Philips has unveiled the world’s only OLED 4K TV (out at the end of October, £3,000, philips.com) — more than 100 times faster than LED-based TVs and using AmbiLight technology for the clearest picture possible.  If you want to create your own images, Sony’s flagship new phone, Xperia XZ (price and release date TBC, sonymobile.com), has a 23MP camera with triple image sensing technology, which basically means no blurry action shots. And forget selfie sticks, the DOBBY (£300, zerotech.com) is a pocket-sized, gesture-controlled drone — just the thing to whip out at a house party.  Oculus Rift VR Headset Smarter home The Amazon Echo (£134, amazon.co.uk) has finally landed in the UK. This voice-activated speaker doubles as your own personal assistant — booking restaurant tables, putting your preferred music on and controlling appliances such as your Smarter iKettle 2.0 (£99.99, smarter.am). Google’s version of the Echo — Google Home, (price TBC, home.google.com) is out early October so stay tuned.  Read more Great British Bake Off: the best speedy gadgets for busy bakers London's hi-tech gardens: the new gadgets making city gardening easy 10 stylish gadgets every man needs at his disposal Meanwhile, fridges don’t get any cooler than the Samsung Family Hub (coming soon, price to be confirmed, samsung.com), with built-in cameras to snap what’s on your shelves and send it direct to your phone, and a wi-fi-enabled touchscreen on the door which lets you order groceries on the spot so you will never be stuck without milk on a busy weekday morning again. Then you need the right lighting. For the perfect glow in every room, Philips Hue Motion Sensor uses an app-controlled dimmer to provide ambient light throughout the day, from midnight toilet trips to morning yoga sessions (£34.99, available from late October, philips.com). And if you do have to leave your hi-tech sanctuary at least you will never lose your keys again, with a slim Bluetooth tracking device for all your possessions, TrackR (£29, trackr.com, available October). Attach it to any item and you can trace it through your phone. Just don’t lose your phone. In the evening, while your robot vacuum, the Dyson 360 Eye (£800, dyson.co.uk), is doing the hard work hoovering, have a glass of wine with the Coravin Model One (£199, coravin.co.uk), a “groundbreaking” device which keeps the cork in place but allows you to pour exactly the amount of vino you need, putting an end to “might as well finish the bottle” hangovers. Trackr is a solution for people who often lose their keys Track stars Sat-nav company TOMTOM has just released its first fitness tracker — the TOMTOM Touch (£129.99, currys.co.uk), which comes with a scary-sounding capability to calculate the muscle mass and body fat percentage of the wearer. It also monitors heart rate and sleep. The battery lasts five days. Meanwhile, the new FITBIT Charge 2 (£129.99, fitbit.com) has a bigger screen, comes in more colours and offers guided breathing sessions “for moments of calm”.  Of course, wearable trackers no longer have to be on your wrist. The discreet BellaBeat Leaf (from £89, bellabeat.com) can be worn as a necklace or a brooch, and tracks women’s stress, steps, sleep and menstrual cycle.  Or there’s the light, unobtrusive Lumo Run (from £75, lumobodytech.com), which feature a tracker embedded in your leggings or shorts to collect data about your workout and act as your personal coach. 9 best hair styling gadgets 10 show all 9 best hair styling gadgets 1/10 Take a look at our favourite hair styling gadgets... 2/10 Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer At the cutting edge of new technology is the Dyson hair dryer.

There are also three different roller sizes, meaning your curls will look more natural than beauty queen. £24, Amazon,Buy it now 7/10 Instyler Tulip Curler If you’ve ever struggled to create the perfect curl with a straightener or tong, this is the tool for you.

It comes with three heat settings and can also be used as a crimper for when you’re feeling the ’80s vibe. £29.99, Argos, Buy it now 10/10 BaByliss Diamond Straightener For a decent pair of straighteners on a relatively modest budget, you can’t go wrong with the BaByliss Diamonds. These come with a curved barrel, meaning you can straighten or curl your hair as you wish. They almost match the GHDs in quality and for less than half the price, they’re a must-have tool. £39.99, Amazon, Buy it now On the move If last year was all about the hoverboard, get ready to be lapped on your bike by smug commuters on portable electric scooters.  The URB-E (£1,125, urb-e.com) is lightweight enough to carry, small enough to fold under your desk and it will even charge your phone for you — what a productive way to travel. It’s definitely more fun than going to work on the Tube. @katewills  More about: Gadgets Tech Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps Close We have noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Now travelers can truly enjoy their hard-earned vacations even without Internet connection or mobile data. Whether you’re juggling work, school, family, or just the demands of daily life, everyone needs a little break and a new adventure sometimes. But knowing what to do once your vacation starts can turn what’s supposed to be fun into a lot of work. You might get recommendations from friends, professional travel guides, or online reviews — but figuring out how to squeeze everything you want to do into a finite window of time can be stressful, especially when you’re in a new place, often with limited access to the web. In fact, a GoodThink study showed that 74% of travelers feel the most stressful aspect of travel is figuring out the details. Google Trips is a personalized tour guide in your pocket. Each trip contains key categories of information, including day plans, reservations, things to do, food & drink, and more, so you have everything you need at your fingertips. The entire app is available offline — simply tap the “Download” button under each trip to save it to your phone. Choose your own adventure For the top 200 cities in the world, Google Trips shows you a variety of day plans featuring the most popular daily itineraries. We’ve automatically assembled the most popular sights, attractions, and local gems into a full day’s tour — all based on historic visits by other travelers. Say you’re visiting Barcelona. You can choose from multiple day plans, like “Eixample District,” which maps out the can’t-miss buildings by Antoni Gaudi, the famous Spanish architect. Plan each day of your trip like magic Everyone has different interests and time constraints. No matter how popular an itinerary is, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for the perfect day or the perfect trip. Google Trips can help you build your day around places you already know you want to visit. Say your friends told you that you have to see the Sagrada Familia — and you’re looking for suggestions on things to do around that spot. Press the “+” button in the day plans tile to jump into a map view containing all the top attractions in your destination. If you’re time constrained, you can specify above the map whether you have just the morning or afternoon, versus a full day. Then simply tap and pin the Sagrada Familia to build your itinerary around it. Google Trips automatically fills in the day for you. If you want more options, tap the “magic wand” button for more nearby sights. You can pin any new spots you like, and if you want even more, each tap of the “magic wand” instantly gives you a new itinerary with updated nearby attractions like Palau Macaya or Parc del Guinardo, so you can build your own custom itinerary in minutes while munching on your morning churro. All your travel info, all in one place Keeping track of all your flight, hotel, car and restaurant reservations when you travel can be tough. With Google Trips, all your travel reservations are automatically gathered from Gmail and organized for you into individual trips, so you don’t have to search and dig up those emails. They’re waiting for you within the reservations tile, even without WiFi. Vacations are a chance to recharge and experience new places and cultures. For your next trip, let us help you see all the sights you want to see, without all the work. Google Trips, available now on Android and iOS, has you covered from departure to return.

Google Promotes Pixel and Pixel XL Upcoming Unveiling with Statue in Brooklyn GO The company placed a statue in Brooklyn, New York Sep 22, 2016 11:30 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google is currently working on two new smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, which it intends to unveil on October 4. The company has started dropping hints on the upcoming unveiling, with the latest being a statue it placed in Brooklyn. Google is promoting the October 4 event for unveiling the upcoming Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones with a statue placed in Brooklyn, New York. An image of the statue was posted on Reddit and it features the G logo, together with the October 4 date and the frame of a phone. The design of the upcoming device is difficult to make out and the #MadeByGoogle mark appears on the platform the statue is based on in Brooklyn Bridge Park. The sculpture is just one of the marketing measures Google has taken so far. Just a few days ago, the company launched a commercial for promoting the October 4 event and there's also a website where fans can register and get the latest news about Google's upcoming phones. Pixel and Pixel XL could come with IP53 certification Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones are manufactured by Google and HTC. They're said to come with IP53 certification, which protects them from water splashes and dust. The phones are also said to come with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box, as well as the new Pixel Launcher and Google Assistant. Google Pixel could come with a 5-inch display with 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution and run on a Snapdragon 820 processor with 4GB of RAM. It could also have a quad-core 2.15GHz CPU and Adreno 530 graphics processing unit. Internal storage could reach 32GB and the phone could come with a fingerprint scanner on the back and a 12MP rear camera. Front camera capacity could reach 8MP. Pixel XL will have roughly the same design as Pixel, but will carry some different specs. The phone will have a larger display of 5.5 inches and 1440 x 2560 pixel resolution. It could also come with Snapdragon 821 processor, but that remains to be seen.

 A career coach and former Googler breaks down the 4 steps to making a change in your career Shana Lebowitz Sep. 22, 2016, 7:33 AM 7,929 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jenny Blake. Mark Hanauer The thought of making a career change can be terrifying, and for good reason: Work is a huge piece of most people's identity, not to mention their livelihood. Even if you hate your current gig, why leave the devil you know? If there's anyone who gets these feelings, it's Jenny Blake, a career coach and the author of the new book "Pivot." Blake started out on the AdWords product training team at Google; then helped launch Google's Career Guru program; then left Google after publishing her first book, "Life After College," to start a business based on her blog and book. In "Pivot," she guides readers through the process of pivoting — making a career change, however big or small — so that it's less intimidating than it might otherwise seem. The main thing to know about Blake's pivot plan is that it involves a lot of careful planning and introspection — so even if the final outcome doesn't look exactly the way you imagined it, presumably you won't wind up broke, unemployed, or regretful. Blake visited the Business Insider office in September to talk about the four steps involved in the pivot process: 1. Plant Blake draws an analogy between a career pivoter and a basketball player: "When a basketball player stops dribbling, they ground down on their plant foot. And in terms of career paths, your plant foot [is] your strengths, your existing assets, what you're already good at, who you know, what you already have experience in, and your one-year vision of what success looks like a year from now." The idea here is that your next career move should be based on what's working well in your current career stage. One way to do that, Blake writes, is simply by asking yourself: "What am I insanely good at? When do I feel most 'in the zone?' What natural talents have I refined into strengths over time?'" 2. Scan "The basketball player can scan for passing options with their pivot foot. So while you have one part of you that's rooted in your existing strengths, then you have another part of you that is scanning for people, skills, and projects that look interesting for this next direction of your career." This is where networking — or at least some version of it — comes in. Find people you can learn from; and think about what Blake calls your "warm connections," or mutually beneficial relationships that help both parties' careers. You'll also want to figure out where there are gaps in your knowledge or skills. Maybe you need to know more about the audience you're hoping to serve in your next role, for example. 3. Pilot "This would be the basketball player starting to pass the ball around the court. Piloting is about running small experiments with 10-20% of your time to test the three Es: Do I enjoy this new area? Can I become an expert at it? Is there room to expand in the market? "And you can repeat plant, scan, pilot, plant, scan, pilot, over and over — in some cases for months, if not years, perfectly happily, just experimenting." Blake advises against spending an excessive amount of money, energy, or time here. Some potential pilots she recommends are: Taking on advisory board positions with other companies, holding focus groups and creating prototype solutions for participants' needs, and trying out side projects at work in addition to your regular duties. 4. Launch "Eventually it comes time to make a shot, or what I call in the pivot method, 'launch.' So this would be when one of your pilots starts taking off and you decide to go all in on the new direction." There are a number of ways to know when you're ready to launch, Blake writes. Maybe it's when you have enough money saved; when you finish a big project at work; or when you acquire a certain number of clients. The most important thing to know, Blake said, is: "By repeating plant, scan, pilot, you reduce risk, but ultimately when it comes time for a launch, whether it's quitting your job or starting a business, you go all in, even with the remaining uncertainty. And most pivoters I spoke with don't regret their decision. Even if things don't pan out exactly as planned, by the time you launch you know that you would regret staying in place more than launching and then having to readjust if things don't work out as planned."

Advertisement Description Technical Change Log Comments How To Browse Privately In Google Chrome Google’s game changing browser Chrome combines sophisticated technology with a simple UI, to create a faster, safer and easier browsing experience. Launched in 2008, Google Chrome quickly dominated the browser market to become the most used browser globally within 4 years of its public release. Google’s rapid and continuous development cycle ensures the browser continues to compete with the other most popular and advanced web browsers available. Speed Perhaps the area Google invested most of its development time to differentiate from other browsers. Google Chrome launches extremely quickly from your desktop, runs applications at speed thanks to a powerful JavaScript engine and loads pages rapidly using the WebKit open source rendering engine. Add to this quicker search and navigation options from the simplified UI and you have a browser that is pretty hard to beat on speed, especially if gaming is your thing. Clean, simple UI Google Chrome’s most striking feature and a substantial factor in its popularity - the simple UI hasn’t changed much since the beta launch in 2008. Google focused on trimming down unnecessary toolbar space to maximise browsing real estate. The browser is made up of 3 rows of tools, the top layer horizontally stacks automatically adjusting tabs, next to a simple new tabs icon and the standard minimize, expand & close windows controls. The middle row includes 3 navigation controls (Back, Forward & Stop/Refresh), a URL box which also allows direct Google web searching and a star bookmarking icon. Extensions and browser settings icons line up to the right of the URL box. The third row is made up of bookmark folders and installed apps. Easily overlooked now, this clean UI was a breath of fresh air compared to the overcrowded toolbars of popular browsers pre-2008. Privacy Another hugely popular feature, Incognito mode allows you to browse privately by disabling history recording, reducing traceable breadcrumbs and removing tracking cookies on shutdown. Chrome’s settings also allow you to customize regular browsing privacy preferences. Security Chrome’s Sandboxing prevents malware automatically installing on your computer or affecting other browser tabs. Chrome also has Safe Browsing technology built in with malware and phishing protection that warns you if you encounter a website suspected of containing malicious software/activity. Regular automatic updates ensure security features are up to date and effective. Customization A vast selection of apps, extensions, themes and settings make your browsing experience unique to you. Improve productivity, security, navigation speed, pretty much anything you can think of with apps and extensions from the Google Chrome Store. Install themes created by top artists or make your own using mychrometheme.com. Sign in with your Google Account to back up your contacts, preferences, history as well as access all your Google tools with a single login. The program provider has restricted distribution of older versions of this product. FileHippo apologises for any inconvenience caused. Looking for the Mac version of Google Chrome?

Strive to use the devrel@ list as much as possible. It is not publicly accessible, so it is ok to talk about NDA'ed information there. For immediate concerns or private matters (PTO, etc.) use the devrel-team@ list. IRC Channels We spend a lot of time on IRC. You might be interested in the following channels: #devrel: Team channel (with public logs). #awayteam: Social channel for remote employees #moco: Private MoCo employee channel (password) #airmozilla: Chat regarding current broadcasts on Air Mozilla #servicedesk: Technical support Ideally you'll find a way to stay connected permanently, either by setting up a "bouncer" like ZNC or by using a service like IRCCloud. Mozilla has a private IRCCloud installation. You can request an account by filing a Service Now ticket (Service Desk → Accounts → Other). Vidyo We use Vidyo for teleconferencing. You can install it from v.mozilla.com. Headsets are strongly recommended with Vidyo. Team Calendars You should be added to this private calendar: DevRel Travel and PTO, a *private* calendar which tracks where the DevRel team is, including both work travel and PTO. Dan Callahad or Havi Hoffman can add you. You should add and contribute to these public calendars: CFP Calendar, which tracks upcoming conference submission deadlines, managed by Havi Hoffman. Editable by all of DevRel, so you can add CFPs you're tracking. Mozilla Staff Speaking Appearances. You should add your public speaking appearances here, including the talk topic and conference information. You can see where other Mozilla staff are speaking (many people outside DevRel speak publicly!). You might want to watch these public calendars: Tech Speakers appearances, where our Tech Speakers program posts their speaking appearances. Community and Mozilla Reps events, where our broader Mozilla community post their public events. Yammer Our corporate Yammer doesn't have a great reputation, but it can still be worthwhile to sign up for daily email digests to get a broader sense of what's going on within the company. Directories Mozilla has two primary directories Mozillians, the Mozilla Community Directory Phonebook, the Mozilla Employee Directory People tend to put their cell phone number in the Phonebook so that folks can get in touch with them in an emergency or while they're on the road. Outbound Messaging Blog We own the Hacks Blog. (Admin link) Hacks uses your LDAP credentials for authentication. To get access to the Hacks blog, pester someone on the devrel-team mailing list. Twitter We own two Twitter accounts: @MozHacks, which targets general web developers @MozAppsDev, which focuses on webapps. Credentials are on the Intranet YouTube We post on the Mozilla Hacks channel. Credentials are on the Intranet Adding subtitles If you have written (and followed quite faithfully!) a script of your video, YouTube can do a pretty good job of calculating the timings and thus generate subtitles automatically without having to manually transcribe it or sending it to a transcription service. Once you have uploaded the video, go to the video details page in the manager, and click on the "Subtitles and CC" tab, and then on the "Add new Subtitles or CC" blue button/dropdown on the right. It might ask you to select the video language beforehand. Select the language of your video (e.g. English (United Kingdom)) and then in "Select method" choose "Transcribe and auto-sync". Copy and paste the script into the text area and click "Set timings". This will take a bit - like one or two minutes. Refresh and see if the timing is right with the video preview in that page. You can adjust things there. Each subtitle track will be a "draft". You need to click "publish" before it's available to everyone. Here's another way to do transcripts (that doesn't require using YouTube): 1) Go to rev.com. Sign up/in. Fill out their forms and request a transcript for your video. It'll cost $1/min. 2) Be sure to order CAPTIONS. That will give you the needed timecode, so the video knows when to display which part of the transcript. https://www.rev.com/caption 3) When offered the chance (usually after ordering), do provide names of people and industry vocabulary (like the words CSS, JavaScript, etc). That will help the transcriber get more things right. 4) After you get the transcript, proof-read it and fix the mistakes. Sometimes there are a lot. If so, give that person a low rating. Usually it's pretty darn good. Still a lot of work for you to clean up, but way less work than transcribing it yourself. 5) If you are using YouTube, go there to add the captions, using their directions as a guide. https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYcj85tBje4. If you are using Vimeo, search their documentation for directions. If you are using AirMozilla, ping that team to find out if/how to do transcripts. 6) I recommend also publishing the transcript in the notes section of the video page, that way if someone goes to the webpage to watch, they can read along in a big block of text if they don't want to use the CC function. Just gives people options. It's easier for scanning and referring back to something. And it helps with SEO. Lanyrd We're trying to standardize on listing our upcoming events in Lanyrd. This is still a work in progress, but please sign up. Other Resources Wikis Meeting minutes and other team information can be found on the wiki. Mozilla also has: Intranet, an old employee Wiki Mana, the new employee Wiki that has mostly replaced the Intranet, especially for HR information Etherpads Most teams take meeting notes in Etherpad. It's like a lightweight Google Doc. The DevRel weekly meetings use the devrel-weekly pad, with notes archived on the wiki after each meeting. We put recordings of our talks on the talks and videos pad. You can create a pad with an arbitrary name by going to https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/pad-name-here. Etherpads (and their edit histories) are public. Google Drive Some teams use Google Docs pretty heavily. DevRel doesn't, but you should know that your Mozilla account has access to the standard Google tools. Google Drive is a good place to put things that can't be public (NDA'd partner announcements, etc). GitHub Mozilla takes a somewhat scattershot approach to source control and issue tracking. The two main GitHub organizations that are likely to concern you as an employee are: Mozilla, for general Mozilla projects. Mozdevs, more of a DevRel sandbox. You should be a member of both of these organizations. Pester someone on devrel-team if not. Some projects also live in Mozilla-B2G (Firefox OS) and Mozilla-Services (Sync, network service infrastructure). Bugzilla Many Mozilla projects, including Firefox itself, track issues in Bugzilla. You can use bugzil.la to shorten links, like this: https://bugzil.la/1000000 We tend to care about two Bugzilla keywords: DevAdvocacy, for bugs we file based on external feedback. devrel-needed, for things we should evangelize once implemented Watch Bugzilla for Humans II to get a better understanding of how to work with Bugzilla. Other Notes Okta and Single Sign-on (SSO) Many of our corporate websites, like ServiceNow and Egencia, use Okta for single sign-on. You can see a dashboard with links to services at https://mozilla.okta.com/. PTO (Paid Time Off) and Holidays For PTO, fill out the form and make sure you CC devrel-team. When on PTO, traveling, or just out of the office, add the dates you'll be gone to the Evangelism Speaking calendar. To see what holidays we get, check out Mana. There are instructions for adding them to your Google Calendar on that page. Mozilla Standard Time Assume that everything is Pacific time unless otherwise specified. Public By Default Strive to do your work and hold your discussions in public. Mozilla an open, non-profit project with a vibrant community. Privacy makes it more difficult for volunteers to stay aware of or contribute to Mozilla's efforts. Put a license on it! Generally we use the Mozilla Public License 2 or Apache 2 for individual repositories created from scratch. When contributing to existing repositories (which is encouraged--we strive to be good open source citizens!), respect existing licenses. Here are the full details of Mozilla's License policy, where you can also find a handy flow chart to help you decide which license you should use. The Manifesto Mozilla Corporation (MoCo) is a normal company, but we're also a wholly owned subsidiary of the non-profit Mozilla Foundation (MoFo), which exists to safeguard and promote the Web as a public resource. We have a manifesto that explains our principles. It's DevRel's job to ensure that we're upholding that manifesto when working with the developers who build the Web. Don't Ask for Permission Mozilla is an open, chaotic, participatory ball of fun. Push buttons, send emails, and edit wikis like you own the place. Sponsorship and Speakers If someone wants you to speak at their event, or wants Mozilla to sponsor their event, ask them to fill out the speaker request form and mention you by name. Staff involvement at conferences + events: If staff wants to attend an event, approval should be from their team and manager and from their budget. If they want to speak at an event, submits proposal and is accepted, and rejected by their internal department to travel to the event, we can review the request under Dev Rel. They can file a bug (which helps us keep track of these requests instead of through email) speaker request form Reps and community members should first go through the Reps Council for review. Events where we have speakers confirmed, supporting with sponsorship, will be posted on our Evangelism calendar which flows into the Mozilla.org Events website, and verbally announced at our Monday Morning Project Calls. Branding materials for sponsoring We generally sponsor using the Firefox Developer Edition brand. This is a somewhat stock reply you can use when responding to organisers who want to get branding (logos, text) from us to display in their website and other promotional materials. Adjust as required: 1. Please use the Developer Edition Wordmark + Logo from https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/identity/firefox/wordmarks/#firefox-developer 2. Please link to https://firefox.com/developer 3. For text, please use the following: Built for those who build the Web. Firefox Developer Edition brings your core dev tools together with some powerful new ones that will extend your ability to work across multiple platforms from one place. It’s everything you’re used to, only better. And only from Firefox. Alternatively, you can choose to use Mozilla's branding: 1. Please use the Mozilla wordmark from https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/identity/mozilla/branding/ 2. Please link to https://www.mozilla.org/ 3. For text, please use the following: At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers and builders working together to keep the Internet alive and accessible, so people worldwide can be informed contributors and creators of the Web. We believe this act of human collaboration across an open platform is essential to individual growth and our collective future. Read the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a> to learn even more about the values and principles that guide the pursuit of our mission. Travel, Expenses & Event Reports We use Egencia for booking most travel and lodging, though AirBNB is also available. Details and policies on Mana. Request an Egencia account on Service Now under Workplace Resources → Travel When traveling, add the dates you'll be gone to the Evangelism Speaking calendar. We use Expensify for managing reimbursement for work-related expenses. Details and policies on Mana. (Tip: Most expenses should be marked as "reimbursable," and not as "billable" in Expensify.) EVENT FEEDBACK/Trip Reports: Speakers & all attendees (whether you're audience, speaker, staff): Please share your feedback about developer events here: http://bit.ly/devrel-event-report Booking travel tips Short trips (less than a week) incur on the "unofficial business travel tax" so they might be even more expensive than a trip to the same place for 8 days. Sometimes it's cheaper to stay a day after or before and pay an extra hotel night, than coming back sooner. It's a good idea to juggle a bit and check various dates to find what's the best rate, if you can afford some flexibility. When you have to connect, always aim for at least 1:30h of layover, specially in big airports. 2h should be good, 3-4 hours is a long break and could be a good option if your trip is really long so you can stretch legs, have a decent drink, etc. Anything more than that is going to drive you nuts; it's advised you try other options, as advised above. Also: avoid busy and big airports or airports where meteorological conditions make it often hard to land or take off. Case in point: Chicago (ORD). It's also better to book all travel with the same company or alliance, as if something goes wrong, it's easier to get rescheduled in their systems. Otherwise you'll be dealing with various companies that are not interested in your wellness (i.e. they don't care about you). If anything goes wrong (cancelled flights, missed connections...), call Egencia (+1 (866) 397-2677 or +1 (702) 939-2530). It might take time, as they have to deal with airlines' systems and rules, but they will sort it out for you. That's what we pay them for. Travel Policy Guidelines The most current version of Mozilla travel policy for staff lives on mana, which is behind LDAP. Here are relevant excerpts for staff and volunteer contributors when booking travel for Mozilla: Low Fare: We try to balance cost savings with convenience and allow flights that are within $200 of the lowest otherwise logical fare as still being within policy. Any flights greater than $200 of the lowest logical fare will generate an "out of policy" notification and will require special approval. Reasonable flights: We ask that you consider other departure times during your day of travel as well as longer trips. Advance Purchase: Please book your travel at least 14 days in advance, otherwise you will get an "out of policy" notification that requires special approval. Flights more than 365 days in the future are also "out of policy". Layovers: We do consider flights with 2 or more connections as unreasonable and don’t expect you to consider those as a "reasonable flight option". Winning the upgrade lottery Although we travel Economy / Coach, there are ways you can experience a bit of luxury. First thing is to sign up for the fidelity program of the airline you're going to fly with. Enter your membership details in Egencia, so they get added to the flights you book. If the flight is overbooked and they need to seat groups or families together, but they can't because you're taking one of the seats, and there is space on better cabins, they might relocate you, i.e. upgrade you. You increase your upgrade chances by having more 'status' than other solo travellers in the flight. The more points, the higher in the list of upgrades you are. The only exception is if you have special dietary requirements, as then they can't upgrade you because they prepare those meals per person in advance, and they can't serve you "lesser quality" food in a better cabin. So, specifying a special diet disqualifies you from an upgrade. How do you find if you've been upgraded? When your ticket is scanned before boarding, they might get a 'new seat' alert, or if you use the airline app you might notice that your checked-in seat has been changed. Swag We tend to focus on stickers since they're affordable, compact, and travel well. You can order rolls of 500 3" Firefox stickers via Bugzilla, but we tend to prefer to print our own, higher quality stuff via StickerMule. If you need stickers, pester someone on devrel-team and we'll get some ordered or shipped. Business Cards To order business cards, request an account on in ServceNow under Workplace Resources → Business Cards Remote Work If you work remotely, familiarize yourself with the Home Space Worker Guidelines on Mana. CrashPlan Backups We have an enterprise subscription to CrashPlan for backups. If you'd like to use it, check the instructions on Mana. Presentation Software Use what you're most comfortable with, but consider using an HTML5 based slide framework like reveal.js if possible. Screenflow and Other Software We tend to like Screenflow for recording screencasts. Buy a license and expense it, or request a license through ServiceNow under Service Desk → Order something → Software Applications → Other Applications → Non-Catalog Software. If you need other software, it's likely available in the ServiceNow catalog. Video bumpers You can add these before / after your screencasts: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mckpgu1p2951crv/DevRelBumpers%3Atools.zip?dl=0 These come from [this bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1145759] and were rendered by Rainier. Document Cameras If you're doing a lot of work on mobile, the IPEVO Ziggi-HD USB Document Camera is a great choice. Buy one and expense it, or request one through ServiceNow under Service Desk → Order something → Accessories → Other → Non-Catalog Accessories Audio Recording Equipment (i.e. microphones and so) TL;DR: the Blue Yeti with a pop up filter is a good combination. Marco Arment's recommendations (via Jen) Dan Benjamin's recommendations (via Jen) Jen uses a Heil PR40 when she's at home, and a Zoom H5 portable recorder and two Shure SM58s when on the road. Potch uses a this bundle for mobile recording people.mozilla.org If you'd like some web space on people.mozilla.org, file a ticket on ServiceNow under Service Desk → Accounts → SSH to add a public SSH key to your LDAP account. To generate an SSH keypair, see the Git documentation. Once added, you should be able to SSH or SFTP into people.mozilla.org and upload content into your public_html folder. It will appear online at https://people.mozilla.org/~ldapname/. Traveling abroad VISA Depending on your nationality and residence country, some destination don't allow free pass through their borders. It is important to visit official tourist web sites for the countries you will visit to find out how to get your visit permit. The permit usually cost you a fee, expend this fee in your travel report. Health considerations Pay special attention to health considerations when traveling to developing countries. You will probably need vaccines and bring some medicines with you. Don't leave this to the end since some vaccines need time to be effective and other must be taken before entering the risk zone. The best thing you can do is to talk with your family doctor or look for government resources. Medical insurance Mozilla employees are covered by a medical insurance while traveling. Print a copy of the Travel Assistance ID Card and Flyer, keep it among your traveling documents always on hand and label it "MEDICAL INSURANCE" in English and in the local language. Mobile data connection The recommendation is to buy a local pre-paid SIM card. Use Prepaid Data SIM Card website to check the alternatives per country.

Written by Jamie Davies 22 September 2016 @ 10:34 Google has launched its artificial intelligence inspired messaging app Allo, but seems to have compromised on user privacy in its desperation to compete with WhatsApp. Artificial intelligence offers the industry a lot of positives, from predictive analytics through to automation of an employee’s most mundane tasks, however Google has seemingly taken the concept one step further removing the users need to think during a conversation. After all, in a world where Netflix box sets are being released on an hourly basis, and Tinder profiles are set to burst with new matches, who now has the time to think about what to say in a chat with a mate? While the basics of the platform are ultimately similar to competitors in the market, Google has chosen to incorporate its artificial intelligence capabilities in an effort to create a unique selling point and tempt users away from established platforms such as WhatsApp and iMessage. While a very simple function for the moment, the AI component of the platform will suggest messages to the user which (in theory) should be consistent with the conversation. For example, should your friend upload a picture of a dog, the platform may suggest sending a message along the lines of “what an amazing dog”. Once again, it is a simple feature for the moment, though there could be the potential for a user not having to think about what to say in the conversation. Through various AI techniques, the platform could farm social media platforms to continue the conversation. Using natural language processing, it could be possible for the AI to create questions for the user, for example, “how long have you had the dog”, to take the conversation one step further. Once this question has been posted, image recognition capabilities could trace through pictures on social media to identify pictures where a dog is included and identify the introduction of said dog. The earliest picture could be six months old allowing the platform to suggest the response “six months now”. When Allo was first unveiled there was a fair bit of talk about privacy, Google having identified this as a differentiator, especially after Facebook’s own-goal over WhatsApp data sharing. However, as The Verge notes, unless you specifically request ‘incognito mode’ Google will keep a record of conversations indefinitely and, as mega whistle-blower Edward Snowden observes, this information could then be requested by the cops. Having said that end-to-end encryption will be a standard feature for the platform, adding another headache for intelligence agencies around the world. Would someone give our spooks a break?! All they want to know is what to get us for Christmas… While its early days for the offering and the WhatsApp team are unlikely to be losing sleep for the moment, there is potential for Google. The team has shown with the launch of Google Hangouts that it can play in the conversation space, and the worldwide dominance of Android as an operating system gives the perfect platform for Google to challenge WhatsApp in the mobile messaging segment. Although one of the largest buzzwords in a field of buzzwords, artificial intelligence is still in its infancy. Google has shown it is capable of breaking dominance in market segments through innovation, determination and a willingness to invest heavily, though the algorithms behind artificial intelligence are still not completely bug free. For the moment it looks like we’ll have to continue thinking about what we say next, irrelevant of how many Tinder matches are potentially out there. Look, a video.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Pitching the Nexus 7 2016 Against the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, Is The Nexus 7 Releasing in October? Let’s See Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: September 23, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Both Nexus 7 2016 and Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 will be releasing this year. The release dates are yet to be revealed but you need help deciding which of these two devices you should be interested in. According to the latest reports, Nexus 7 release date was reported to be on 4th October, as revealed by PC Advisor UK. The report mentions that internet’s most popular leak-star @evleaks tweeted that the Nexus 7 will be released before the end of this year. Google will organise an event on 4th October, and speculations suggest that the company will reveal its greatest technology on that day. Besides the Nexus 7, Google will also reveal its Pixel XL and Pixel X smartphones, Google Home and Daydream VR. Meanwhile, a lot of users have started predicting the possible features of the upcoming Google Nexus 7. Rumours suggest that Nexus 7 will run on Qualcomm’s latest chip, the Snapdragon 820 SoC (System-on-a-chip) processor. The device will be running on 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage capacity, as reported by Android Authority. On the other hand, Tab S3 from Samsung will be available in two different variants, a 9.7inch and 8inch screen with AMOLED panel and featuring 4K display technology. According to reports from Mobile & Apps, Nexus 7 will be available at a display size of 7inches and AMOLED Quad Display panel. Pixel XL and Pixel, the two variants of Nexus will come out in 2560×1600 and 2560×1440 pixel resolutions respectively. The Tab S3 will run on an Exynos 8890 Octa-Core chipset, which is quite similar to that of a Galaxy smartphone. It comes with 4GB of RAM and two internal storage variants of 32GB and 64GB. Compared to that, the Nexus 7 has a Snapdragon 820 SoC, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. Earlier, the internet rumour mill was going crazy about a new Nexus 7 tablet to be declared at the Google I/O event, on 18th May 2016. Sadly, that day came and went, and there was no sign of such a device. However, that doesn’t mean that the internet has stopped talking about the new Nexus 7. The device is apparently in the pipeline and to be released before 2016 ends. We are already aware of the fact that Google is holding an event on 4th October, where the new Pixel XL and Pixel X smartphones will be released, along with Google Home and Daydream VR. It is possible that Google will be using this event to bring out the Nexus 7. Rumours of a new Nexus 7 began last year in October, following a Trusted Reviews interview with Jonney Shih, the chairman of Asus. He said that when it comes to the first generation Nexus, both parties feel that it will be a great product with impressive functionality and price. Even with the second generation Nexus 7, they migrated to a full-HD screen, and they still believe in such technological aspects. However, the next one involves a lot of discussion and planning. In case you didn’t know, Asus was the manufacturer responsible for the production of first and second generation Nexus tabs, but Shih hasn’t confirmed that a third Nexus device will be entering production. Moreover, rumours indicate that it is Huawei and not Nexus, which is behind the upcoming Nexus 7. The company has previously trademarked the name Nexus 7P. It was recently confirmed by Huawei that it is making a Nexus device for 2016. A lot of spectators are convinced that HTC will be making both the Pixel phones. Therefore, a Nexus 7 tablet coming out of Huawei stables doesn’t sound impossible at all.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Health Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Google Pixel phone series tipped to come with IP53 certification Latest reports indicate that the build quality of Google Pixel series will not be on par with Apple iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7. Rohit KVN   September 22, 2016 16:25 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares [Representational Image] Google Pixel phone series tipped to come with IP53 certification. In Picture: A woman holds her smartphone, which displays the Google home page.Reuters Google released a teaser video a few days ago, strongly hinting that the company will unveil a new smartphone series next month. Now, Android Police has cited reliable sources to claim that the upcoming Google handsets, which are rumoured to be named Pixel and Pixel XL, will have IP53 rating. If this is true, many Android fans will be furious, as IP53 certification does not even come close to matching the build quality of the rivals — Apple iPhone 7, Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Sony Xperia XZ series. Why advertise with us? Related Google Allo messaging app with AI technology released Lenovo Z2 Plus launched in India: Top five key features So what's protected under IP53 ratings? In IP53 certification, the numerical '5' suggests that the upcoming Google Pixel series devices cannot withstand certain dust particles from entering the device, but it assures users that it won't affect the phone's operation. On the other hand, the numerical '3' indicates that if water is sprayed at an angle of up to 60 degrees from the top, it will have no harmful effect on the phone. This means that Pixel phone users can text and answer calls even in rain, but cannot use them in the swimming pool. However, rival brands come with IP67, and some even more, wherein users can take calls or capture photos underwater without any fear of damaging the phone. That said, we can't jump to the conclusion that Google Pixel series will have IP53 certifications, until the speculation is confirmed.  Also read: Water-resistant Apple iPhone 7 series not covered under liquid damage warranty; what's protected under IP67 rating To provide a better perspective on how the IP ratings are certified, we have provided a detailed explanation and also a table with a IP rating chart. Also read: Google Pixel phone release date revealed; what we know so far on upcoming flagship series How IP dust-and-water resistant ratings are certified to devices As per International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60529, IP (Ingress Protection) rating classifies the degrees of protection provided against the intrusion of solid objects (including body parts like hands and fingers), dust, accidental contact, and water in electrical enclosures. This standard aims to provide users more detailed information on waterproof and other marketing terms that the companies use to sell their devices. IP ratings are defined with two digits. The first numerical represents the level of protection that the enclosure provides against access to hazardous parts. The second digit indicates the protection of the equipment inside the enclosure against harmful ingress of water. Dust and particulate resistant rating chart: Level Object size protected against Effective against 0 Not protected No protection against contact and ingress of objects 1 >50mm Any large surface of the body, such as the back of the hand, but no protection against deliberate contact with a body part. 2 >12.5mm Fingers or similar objects. 3 >2.5mm Tools, thick wires, etc. 4 >1mm Most wires, screws, etc. 5 Dust Protected Ingress of dust is not entirely prevented, but it must not enter in sufficient quantity to interfere with the satisfactory operation of the equipment; complete protection against contact. 6 Dust Tight No ingress of dust; complete protection against contact. Water and other liquid resistant rating chart: Level Object size protected against  Effective against O Not protected ---- 1 Dripping water Dripping water (vertically falling drops) shall have no harmful effect. 2 Dripping water when tilted up to 15° Vertically dripping water shall have no harmful effect when the enclosure is tilted at an angle up to 15° from its normal position. 3 Spraying water Water falling as a spray at any angle up to 60° from the vertical shall have no harmful effect. 4 Splashing water Water splashing against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effect. 5 Water jets Water projected by a nozzle (6.3mm) against enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects. 6 Powerful water jets Water projected in powerful jets (12.5mm nozzle) against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects. 7 Immersion up to 1m Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1 m of submersion). 8 Immersion beyond 1m The equipment is suitable for continuous immersion in water under conditions which shall be specified by the manufacturer. Normally, this will mean that the equipment is hermetically sealed. However, with certain types of equipment, it can mean that water can enter but only in such a manner that it produces no harmful effects.

What do you do when stuck at a place and have no one to ask around for directions? Or, that moment when you want to get answers to some out-of-the-box questions, or want to plan an outing with friends to the new cafe in town? The answer to most of these questions would be our go-to-guide - Google. Now, imagine a situation where you are able to directly chat with Google through its own smart messaging app which also doubles up as your personal chat assistant. Yes, this is exactly what Google has done by having launched Google Allo, a smart messaging app for iOS and Android, on September 20. The announcement made on its official blog (https://googleblog.blogspot.in/2016/09/google-allo-smarter-messaging-app.html) reads: "Google Allo can help you make plans, find information, and express yourself more easily in chat. And the more you use it, the more it improves over time." Some of the features of Google Allo include Smart Reply which can help people respond quicker even as they are on-the-go. The messaging app also includes a whole array of emojis, stickers, and photos which would add diversity to the communication process and not render it limited only to simple text. Another interesting feature of Google Allo is Google Assistant where one can have a conversation with Google - ask questions and let it help you get things done directly in your chats. Keeping in mind the privacy and security concerns in place, Google Allo also contains an option of chatting in incognito mode. Messages sent and received using this mode will have end-to-end encryption and additional privacy features such as discreet notifications and message expiration. If you received an app preview message from someone using Google Allo, you can download the app to reply and to start using the app yourself to message your friends. The app preview message will look like a notification, and you can respond directly through the notification. If you don't want to download Allo, you can still receive the app preview message and reply. Follow afaqs!

According to August research, the handheld device has increased its share of paid search clicks by about 20 percentage points since 2015, becoming the leading channel for search clicks earlier this year. During Q2 2016, performance media agency iProspect tracked 145,000 active paid search campaigns globally among 1,500 Google AdWords accounts. While the accounts were managed by iProspect US, spending was not confined to US markets. According to the data, the smartphone has continually increased its share of paid search clicks on Google quarter-over-quarter. In particular, the handheld device’s share has grown from about a third in Q2 2015 to just shy of half of all clicks in Q2. Tablets have remained relatively flat. Meanwhile, desktop’s share has dropped substantially. Desktops still accounted for a majority of paid Google clicks as recently as Q2 2015, but lost nearly 14 percentage points in share in the year following. But this shouldn’t come as a surprise, considering the push to allocate more dollars to search advertising overall on mobile (including both smartphones and tablet). Looking at the US specifically, eMarketer estimates that mobile search ad spending will grow by 43.1% this year, in stark contrast to desktop search which will see a 11.4% budget decline. A similar trend is happening outside the US. In Japan, smartphone search ad spending is anticipated to increase over the next few years, from ¥155.9 billion ($1.29 billion) in 2016 to ¥173.1 billion ($1.43 billion) next year. And nearby, in China, mobile search users have grown to more than 477 million.

Google Allo: The turning point in the decline of human interaction? Google’s new Allo app has implications that go much farther than just convenience of search and respond. Written by Swapnil Mathur | Published:September 22, 2016 4:29 pm Google Allo app: Is this really where conversation is supposed to be headed? Google’s new Allo app has been launched amidst a lot of excitement and obviously some privacy concerns. On one hand, we have an app that comes with a built-in Google Assistant powered by Google’s AI, capable of helping out with contextual replies (which get better with time) and on the other hand, we have Google stating that conversations won’t be encrypted by default and will be stored indefinitely on Google servers so as to function as intellectual fodder for its AI. As a peace offering, Google said users could opt to use the incognito mode which offers end-to-end encryption, however, you won’t be able to have Google Assistant partake in those conversations. It is clear that Google Allo is all about “convenience,” whether it is in the form of contextual responses or whether it is for looking up information that you’d like to share with the person at the other end of your non-encrypted, stored-on-Google-server-forever messages. When all is said and done, Allo poses a very clear and present danger. The Privacy Nightmare It’s no secret that Google goes through all data generated by users on its services, be it email, Hangouts or even search. This is how it’s able to serve up contextual ads and other nonsense. The very last bastion of privacy has been texting and voice calls and with Allo, we are set to lose out on one of those. If Allo achieves its goal of replacing your default texting app, and even Whatsapp, imagine the kind of intimate details of your life that Google will have access to. A wife telling her husband what brand of kitchen cleaning aids to get on his way back from work, a young excited college teen discussing with his best friend where to take his girlfriend on a date.

Arvind Kejriwal Attacks Janardhan Reddy Over His Daughter’s Big Fat Wedding Let’s not forget the intimate conversations that take place between lovers. Angry messages from a mother to her son, the son’s depressed responses to his elder brother seeking counsel. All this data goes up into the Google servers, stored permanently, all to become public record in the event of a hack, or if law enforcement agencies, for whatever reason, were to get a subpoena for it. You could of course conduct all your interactions in the incognito mode, but without the added flare of the Google Assistant, what good is Allo anyway? Google Allo makes automated suggestions inside a chat. The Human Disconnect Part of the charm that Google Assistant brings to Allo is its ability to throw up contextual responses. In the initial days, these are limited to “ok, LOL, Great, No problem” and the likes. However, with all the messages you allow Google to read, this AI learns and gets smarter. It will eventually be able to learn your conversational style and serve up more detailed responses. Imagine a scenario where an entire conversation is carried out by means of auto-generated responses, all it needs is a trigger. “Hi, what are you up to?” could be followed up by one contextual response after another, till a plan is formulated. Did that make texting each other easier? Yes. Was there any human element to it? No. Also read: Google Allo app: How to set-up, chat with Google Assistant and more Are we becoming such a lazy species that we consider articulating a response to a text message as a “task” that is better assigned to a machine instead? The reason an “I love you” or “take care, get home safe and call me” carries so much weight is because we know it is coming from a cognitive process signifying love and care. An auto-generated contextual response is devoid of those emotions and while the message may still get across, the emotion behind it becomes questionable at best. It’s something similar to the situation where people don’t actually know or care for when your birthday is, but will wish you simply because Facebook told them to. Read more: Google Allo app: Here’s our first impression of the app Thoughts for Consideration Google Allo is an ambitious project by the Mountain View company, an attempt to bring true machine learning AI to the forefront of consumer technology. However, its implications go much farther than just convenience of search and respond. The balance that we’d managed to maintain between machine aided and human interactions is steadily starting to tip towards the former, which isn’t very healthy for inter-personal relationships. We no longer remember phone numbers; we store them in our phone. We no longer remember birthdays because Facebook will remind us, unless someone sets their special day as private and you don’t wish them (because Facebook didn’t remind you) and now your friendship is over because you’re a horrible person. We no longer accept compliments from our near and dear ones, but will obsess over every single like we get (or didn’t get) on a poor-quality selfie on Instagram. As a species, we have been on somewhat of a downward spiral, but the introduction of Allo has brought us to a significantly worrisome milestone. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaDemonetisation: IT surveys real estate firms in Delhi-NCR to check reports of tax evasion IndiaDemonetisation: Half of ATMs to be recalibrated by next week to dispense new Rs 500, Rs 2000 notes IndiaGovt counters Opposition: Those not in favour will be asked if they support black money IndiaNo intention to demonetise Rs 100/50 notes: Government BusinessArun Jaitley on Vijay Mallya: Bad loans write-off doesn't mean we won't pursue it EntertainmentRajinikanth's Enthiran 2.0 poster featuring Akshay Kumar is out, see pic EntertainmentI am besharam, nudity means nothing to me: Ranveer Singh on Befikre EntertainmentDirector Ameer questions Rajinikanth's integrity for supporting PM Modi's demonetisation EntertainmentRamayan's 'Vibhishan' Mukesh Rawal dies in train accident Must Read Sports2nd Test: Bullet loaded, revolver spun, prayer said SportsHere's how India have fared on rank turners SportsKartik explains art of bowling on crumbling wickets TechnologyOnePlus 3T vs iPhone 7 Plus vs Galaxy S7 Edge vs Pixel XL: Flagship wars TechnologyTomTom launches Spark 3, Adventurer sports watches and Touch fitness tracker in India TechnologyGoogle suggests standardised charging, wants to make it safer  These are world's sexiest men alive in 2016 Nov 16: Latest News Demonetisation: Undeposited old notes may result in windfall for government Five questions: Government should not have opted for a hurried decision, says JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav Don’t apply indelible ink on left hand, State Election Commission tells Maharashtra government Demonetisation of Rs 500, Rs 1000 notes: Mamata Banerjee leads protest march to Rashtrapati Bhavan The quandary of DCC banks in Maharashtra: Crores in deposit, no money for customers Swapnil MathurSwapnil Mathur indulges his passion for writing and technology by para... read more Google suggests standardised charging, wants to make it safer Delhi pollution: Choosing the right mask; fit, filter and cost ‘Indians are finally realising there is no ‘one-shoe-fits-all’ option’                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

By Wade Sheridan   |   Sept. 22, 2016 at 6:55 AM Follow @upi Comments 1 of 2 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Sept. 22 (UPI) -- Google is celebrating the arrival of fall in the northern hemisphere and spring in the southern hemisphere with new Doodles. For users living north of the equator, a visit to Google's homepage will display an animated short featuring a collection of familiar anthropomorphized rocks who were last seen welcoming the arrival of summer solstice in June. The rocks this time begin to admire the blowing of orange leaves until one of their friends decides to eat a fallen leaf much to the group's surprise. "Today is the first day of fall, also known as the equinox - when the length of night and the day are nearly equal," notes the internet giant while discussing the Doodle. "It's also the beginning of the cooler temps that will be with us until spring comes around. Today's Doodle celebrates the new season with the orange glow of fall's falling leaves." For those living south of the equator, it is now the start of spring with Google displaying a similar animated short on their homepage featuring the same gathering of rocks. This time the gang finds themselves happy to see a pink leaf covered tree before one indifferent rock decides to blow them all away, visibly upsetting the others. "Today, we unbutton our winter coats and welcome spring with open arms," Google writes of the season change. "As the earth's axis tilts closer to the sun and the days grow longer, plants, trees, and buds come alive and "spring forth." Here's to fresh beginnings, new growth, and warmer days. Happy first day of spring!"

Available through the Google Play store, the app turns phones into virtual paper airplanes that can be thrown through a digital world and caught by other Paper Planes app users. The virtual vessels in the Paper Planes app aren't just null items. Rather, before throwing their planes, users can write messages on them and stamp them with their country's faux-passport. Once released into the app's wireframe digital world, any user can use their virtual net to catch a plane, open it up, read what's written and where it's from. Beyond the charming premise, the Paper Planes app is fun to use. To throw the paper planes, users must hold their phones between aa thumb and forefinger and move their hand, just like with the physical origami pieces. #1 IN TREND REPORTS Find Better Ideas Faster™ with our unrivalled research, fueled by 100,000,000 people ➤ Related Top 10 Slideshows Video Pro Services Innovation Accelerator Innovation Keynotes Trend Reports Custom Dashboards Future Festival Free Resources Innovation Videos & Books Weekly Trend Report NEW: 2017 Trend Report Get a FREE Report Origami Inspired Wall HangersThe Fly Clothing Hook by Elisa Honkanen Has a Kid-Friendly Concept Paper Plane-Spewing GunsThe Paper Airplane Machine Gun Folds & Shoots Paper Airplanes Airbourne Snail MailThe Flying Letter Allows you to Send Notes in Style Live-Streaming Toy PlanesThis Smartphone-Controlled Paper Airplane Offers a Pilot's View Top 60 Gaming Ideas in OctoberFrom Interactive Golfing Videos to Single-Handed Gaming Keypads Top 100 Mobile App Ideas in OctoberFrom LGBT Teen Community Apps to Anemia-Detecting Apps Stats for Paper Airplane Apps Trending: This Quarter & Buzzing Research: 283 clicks in 7 w Interest: 0.9 minutes Concept: Paper Planes App Related: 79 examples / 61 photos Segment: Neutral, 12-55 Comparison Set: 29 similar articles, including: self-propelling paper planes, pov drones, and paper airplane-producing machines.

Which said that it had surveyed more than 5,500 members in June this year. Of the 2,500 who had upgraded to Windows 10 from an older version, it found that ore than one in ten had gone back to the previous version. Read more Woman get thousands of dollars after computer installs Windows 10 Many others complained about the way that Windows “nags” its users to upgrade, if they’re using an older version of the software. Others said that they had declined those notifications but found the operating system had been installed anyway. Once it was actually installed, man users complained that the operating system didn’t work with their existing hardware, like printers, Wi-Fi cards or speakers. Others said that files had been lost and that they had to pay out to repairers to get them fixed. Which said that users affected by those problems should look at their rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. That allows people to get a repair or replacement if a piece of software is faulty; to get their money back if there’s something wrong with it; and to get a repair or replacement of their computer if the faulty software led it to break. The charity called on people affected by those problems to look into their rights. And it also said that Microsoft should honour complaints by people. Windows 10 launches in UK “We rely heavily on our computers to carry out daily activities so, when they stop working, it is frustrating and stressful,” said Alex Neil, director of campaigns and policy at Which. “Many people are having issues with Windows 10 and we believe Microsoft should be doing more to fix the problem.” Microsoft said that the Windows 10 upgrade had been built to make sure that people could take advantage of the new software. It also said that it has free customer support for anyone running into problems with it.

By Liam Tung | September 22, 2016 -- 10:13 GMT (03:13 PDT) | Topic: Security Edward Snowden has criticized Google's new messaging app. Image: CBS News Google's Allo messaging app and its Assistant bot have finally arrived, but Allo has been slammed for reneging on a promise that it would, by default, make it more difficult to spy on. Because of the missing privacy feature, NSA-contractor-turned-whistleblower Edward Snowden's first take of Allo after yesterday's US launch is that it's just a honeypot for surveillance. "Free for download today: Google Mail, Google Maps, and Google Surveillance. That's #Allo. Don't use Allo," wrote Snowden. Free for download today: Google Mail, Google Maps, and Google Surveillance. That's #Allo. Don't use Allo. https://t.co/EdPRC0G7Py -- Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016 The latest controversy over Google app stems from an Allo product developer from Google's communications division telling The Verge in May that chats sent on the app would be "transiently" stored on its servers. But, according to The Verge, Allo developers have decided to ditch transient storage. Had Allo been designed so that chat logs vanished by default from Google's servers after a short time, they would have been difficult to access if law enforcement presented Google with a warrant. And, as Snowden pointed out, the US foreign intelligence surveillance court approved every one of the nearly 1,500 communication intercept requests made by the NSA and FBI last year. As it stands, the new product is on par with Google Hangouts and Gmail, which use HTTPS to secure transmissions between users and its servers, but is then available for Google's algorithms to use at its datacenters. Allo does support end-to-end encryption, which should make it difficult for anyone but recipient and sender to view the contents of messages; however, Google was criticized by Snowden and other privacy advocates for setting it as off by default. Allo relies on the encryption protocol used by Signal, which Snowden has vouched for as a private messaging app, but in Allo it is only active when users are in Incognito Mode. "We've given users transparency and control over their data in Google Allo. And our approach is simple -- your chat history is saved for you until you choose to delete it. You can delete single messages or entire conversations in Allo," Google said in a statement to TechCrunch. "We also provide the option to chat in Incognito mode, where messages are end-to-end encrypted and you can set a timer to automatically delete messages on your device, and the recipient's, at a set time."

Yeah, no. The version of Allo rolling out today will store all non-incognito messages by default - a clear change from Google’s earlier statements that the app would only store messages transiently and in non-identifiable form. The records will now persist until the user actively deletes them, giving Google default access to a full history of conversations in the app. Users can also avoid the logging by using Allo’s Incognito Mode, which is still fully end-to-end encrypted and unchanged from the initial announcement. Like Hangouts and Gmail, Allo messages will still be encrypted between the device and Google servers, and stored on servers using encryption that leaves the messages accessible to Google's algorithms. For this reason alone, don't use Google Allo. But wait, there's more! There's also the backwards way it handles multiple devices and phone numbers - another reason to not use Google Allo. Sadly, even if you don't have Allo installed, you may still be forced to deal with it at some point because of some 'clever' tricks by Google Play Services on Android. If someone sends you an Allo message, but you don't have Allo installed, you'll get a special Android notification. The notification lets you respond through text along (as opposed to stickers, photos or anything like that), or alternatively ignore it altogether. There's also a button taking you straight to the Play Store install page for Allo. How can Google do this? The notification is generated by Google Play Services, which is installed on just about every Android phone, and updates silently in the background. Don't use Google Allo.

Image: Shutterstock Today (22 September) is the first day of autumn, signified by an almost identical length of daytime and night-time. Google is celebrating. As of 3.20pm (IST) today, the autumnal equinox is officially upon us; the summer signing off with a cold, orange end. Equinox is Latin for ‘equal night’, with the date sharing an almost equal amount of daytime and night-time. Linked to the planet’s rotation and axis tilt, from today until December, the Earth will gradually tilt further away from the sun as the days get shorter. Google has created a Doodle to celebrate the event, with leaves falling from the trees and some rocks enjoying the show.   Given the historic influence of astrological measurements, celebrations are held around the world for events like this. There will be an autumnal equinox celebration held at the Hill of Tara, Co Meath, on Sunday 25 September, for example. In keeping with the theme of equinox, half of the celebration will be before sunset while the other half take place after dark. In the southern hemisphere, the vernal equinox signifies the first day of spring. This time, the Earth’s axis gradually tilts closer and closer to the sun as countries below the equator enjoy the mirrored effect of what happens up north. Again, Google is on hand with a Doodle to celebrate.

"Google Allo can help you make plans, find information, and express yourself more easily in chat. And the more you use it, the more it improves over time," Google said. The app will adjust according to whether its user's style is usually an emoji or written response, for example. Like rival apps, it has tools for personalizing chat messages including changing the size of emojis and a choice of stickers.   Say hello to #GoogleAllo, our smart messaging app that helps you say more and do more ? https://t.co/FtBeMUh15p pic.twitter.com/Bn1sO879lW - Google (@google) September 21, 2016 Allo was unveiled by Google in May at the same time as Google Duo, an app for video calls, which hit the market last month. The app is available on smartphones using Google's Android system and Apple's iOS. Google faces a challenge in carving a place in a sector dominated by popular apps such as WhatsApp, which Facebook acquired for some $20 billion in 2014 and which counts more than a billion users. In July, Facebook said that users of its own Messenger application had also passed the one billion mark. Apple has also moved to catch up with rivals, upgrading the messaging app in its latest iOS 10 launched last week. Google and its earlier messaging app Hangouts had failed to keep pace in a market that also includes Snapchat, Skype and global rivals such as WeChat, Viber, Line, Kik and Telegram. Conversations in Allo will be encrypted, according to Google. And additional privacy will be offered with an "incognito" option in which messages will disappear after a fixed period. But some analysts expressed disappointment that Google did not go further in agreeing not to store messages on its servers, where they can be accessed by authorities. Christopher Soghioan, a privacy researcher with the American Civil Liberties Union, lamented that Google "decided that improving auto responses was worth making all messages accessible to law enforcement." Snowden, the former US intelligence contractor wanted for leaking National Security Agency documents on surveillance, said in a tweet, "Don't use Allo." A later tweet from Snowden called Allo an "app that records every message you ever send and makes it available to police upon request." Google argues that the "smart" features of the application require "data processing" and that the tech giant needs to store chats to improve responses. "We've given users transparency and control over their data in Google Allo," a Google statement emailed to AFP said. "Our approach is simple - your chat history is saved for you until you choose to delete it. You can delete single messages or entire conversations in Allo. "We also provide the option to chat in Incognito mode, where messages are end-to-end encrypted and you can set a timer to automatically delete messages for your device and the person you're chatting with's device at a set time."           Share More > Vote MORE FROM Technology Technology Don't use Google Allo, says Snowden and explains...

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 22 September 2016 | MYT 3:23 PM Google launches Allo, bets on AI to spice up chats Allo Duo: Alphabet Inc launched Allo, a messaging app, a month after Google rolled out Duo, its video calling app. — Reuters Google-parent Alphabet Inc launched Allo, a messaging app that incorporates Google's search feature and a chatbot that uses machine learning to "improve" itself over time. The new messaging service, which was unveiled in May, will compete with Facebook Inc's WhatsApp and Messenger. The much-anticipated launch comes a month after Google rolled out Duo, its video calling app. Allo features a chatbot powered by Google Assistant, a virtual personal assistant like Apple Inc's Siri. Users can call up the assistant in a chat by typing "@google" followed by a search query and the results will be displayed in the chat itself. "The more you use it, the more it improves over time," Amit Fulay, group product manager, wrote in a blog post. The app has a "Smart Reply" feature that suggests responses to chats and can be send with just a tap. "If your friend sends you a photo of their pet, you might see Smart Reply suggestions like 'aww cute!'," Fulay wrote. Users can also use stickers and scribble on photos before sending them. Allo will have end-to-end encryption only while chatting in "Incognito" mode. Whatsapp chats have end-to-end encryption. Google has started rolling out Allo and said the app would be available worldwide in the next few days. — Reuters You May Be Interested Billionaire Ananda Krishnan exploring taking Astro private India bans Zakir Naik's NGO Maybank sells entire stake in Visa Inc for RM413mil Beware of Rove beetles Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Petronas’ net profit soars on lower impairment losses, other factors Malindo Air offering one million tickets to celebrate winning award Catch Doctor-X on the all-new dimsum.my! advertisement Latest News Rideshare service Lyft gets a flashy new look Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment Most Viewed in Tech Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Warning!

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Sources say Google’s Pixel phones will not be too water resistant By John Hoff - September 22, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you were hoping that Google would finally jump on the water resistant mobile phone bandwagon with these new upcoming Pixel smartphones, then you can stop holding your breath. It seems that sources are saying that the new Android reference mobile phones from Google will not carry such features, so you can forget your plans of swimming in a pool with these new phones. Sources say that the new Pixel phones will only receive an IP53 dust and water resistant rating, which for consumers will mean – “don’t get it wet at all costs.” In reality, the rating means that a device will be water resistant if exposed to relatively low pressure water at an upright angle. It means that a little rain would probably not hurt your phone – with “probably” being the operative word here – provided it gets a little wet in the correct upright position. If the device gets wet while lying flat on a surface, then your Pixel smartphone is probably doomed. Check out the video below of an IPx3 test and see how the device is splashed with water at various angles up to 60 degrees from vertical. So practically, the advice would still be, don’t get your phone wet. And dust? Well, the IP53 rating will mean that it will be close to impossible for dust to get into the phone system where it will cause damage, so there’s that. But water, it would be best to make sure your snazzy new Pixel phone does not get wet.

Waarom (en hoe) je Windows pc's zou moeten beheren als iPhones De puzzelstukjes vallen eindelijk in elkaar voor een omnidevice beheeraanpak voor Windows, MacOS, iOS en Android. Galen Gruman Internationaal 22 september 2016 De dagen van System Center van Microsoft zouden wel eens geteld kunnen zijn. Met de introductie van Windows 10 staat Microsoft een hele nieuwe aanpak voor van systeembeheer, dezelfde aanpak die Apple voor de iPad en iPhone en die Google later voor Android koos. Organisaties die overgaan op Windows 10 kunnen er hun voordeel mee doen, omdat IT nu alle clients - Windows 10 pc's, Macs, iOS- en Android-apparaten - vanuit dezelfde consoles met dezelfde policy-driven technologie. Dat is wat je noemt een omnidevice strategie. Dat is tenminste de theorie. In de praktijk ligt het natuurlijk iets ingewikkelder. We gaan hier wat dieper in op wat deze omnidevice strategie precies inhoudt. We kijken naar de tools, de implementatie en naar de nodige bedenkingen die er tegenin kunnen worden gebracht, om te laten zien hoe je organisatie zijn voordeel kan doen met deze zich nog ontwikkelende strategie. The reasons to manage PCs like iPads Tablets today increasingly resemble computers, in both functionality and use, and computers are increasingly taking on tabletlike features. Microsoft, Apple, and Google all recognize that convergence in the form of their "tabtop" devices: the Surface Pro, iPad Pro, and Pixel-C, respectively. IT should too, by moving away from deploying two sets of management tools: one for computers and one for mobile devices, an increasingly meaningless distinction. But the big motivation for doing so is cost savings. The methods and tools for managing capabilities and security for iOS and Android devices are far more labor-efficient than those used to manage traditional PCs. That's largely because the self-enrollment, policy-based approach of managing mobile devices was a necessary outgrowth of the BYOD movement. Most mobile devices weren't initially provisioned by IT, and because IT couldn't touch all devices, as it had long done for PCs, a new management methodology was essential. Soon, enterprise mobility management (EMM) arose to fill the void. Ojas Rege, chief strategy officer at EMM provider MobileIron, says adopting the mobile model for PC management should shed between half and three-quarters of the cost of managing those PCs, after factoring out the client licensing costs for EMM tools. Organizations leveraging EMM typically require only two to four admins to support 10,000 devices, notes Tony Kueh, vice president of research and development at VMware's AirWatch unit, also an EMM provider. Managing PCs is more complex, mainly because customization in Windows applications results in greater variety than what Apple allows for iOS, but Kueh nonetheless expects the EMM approach to greatly reduce the cost of Windows management. Couple these significant TCO benefits with the consistency of a common platform that reduces possible security and compliance gaps, and you can see the appeal of the omnidevice strategy. MobileIron and VMware have high expectations for Windows 10 management through its traditionally mobile-and-Mac management tools, as you'd expect, as do other major EMM providers such as Soti and IBM's Maas360 unit. Gartner is also bullish on the approach, predicting that in two years 40 percent of IT shops will manage at least some Windows PCs using omnidevice-savvy EMM tools. Current Windows management tools find their roots in the 1980s approach to computing, in which IT owns the devices and manually provisions them. Over time, that provisioning has been increasingly automated, using tools like Microsoft's System Center, MicroFocus ZenWorks, LANdesk, and Symantec IT Management Suite (formerly Altiris), but the basic approach of direct IT management has remained. That approach does scale to thousands of computers, as long as they are pretty much all Windows PCs (Mac support came recently for some, though usually for a subset of capabilities), but it is a labor-intensive, slower-to-market approach that puts IT at the center of almost every decision. The EMM approach, on the other hand, assumes little admin labor, in large part because in the early days of mobile, before EMM, IT shops refused to devote resources to supporting mobile devices, forcing vendors to establish a different method to satisfy IT objections around management and security. Another factor in limiting the TCO of EMM's approach is what it obviates, MobileIron's Rege says. "You won't need bolt-on app sandboxing; there's less need for antimalware and less need for traditional agent-based DLP" because the sandboxing model of EMM doesn't let outside apps and agents into the app sandboxes, whether to inspect or infect, he says. Sandboxing is a key foundation of the mobile security model now brought to computers. Data loss prevention (DLP) is still an important measure, Rege notes, but it becomes policy-driven and absorbed by EMM, not handled by software agents' direct inspection of apps.  In other words, a lot of the security superstructure required for today's totally exposed Windows applications goes away when they're natively protected. That also reduces support and operations costs, he adds. In 2011, Apple realized this approach would work as well for computers as it does for mobile devices, so it engineered OS X Lion to adopt many of the same policy-based, self-enrollment management protocols as iOS - policies it made enterprise-grade in 2011's iOS 7as well. Suddenly, IT could set policies that it distributed via profile files that both configured some OS-level features and checked user-controlled settings to ensure compliance: No compliance, no access. Microsoft adopted the same approach in 2015's Windows 10 and expanded it in the various 2016 updates. Windows 10 is starting to get serious IT attention for broad rollout, so Microsoft has been starting to promote the EMM approach while also supporting System Center for the years of PC management legacy. Not all Windows 10 EMM pieces are in place Microsoft has a very convincing diagram of Windows 10 management via EMM, one that suggests all the pieces are in place. But they're not. MICROSOFT Microsoft's vision of using EMM approaches to manage Windows 10 PCs, not only mobile devices. Certainly, the basics are in place, such as enforcing password and encryption policies. Self-enrollment is also available, via Azure Active Directory (AAD) or a third-party EMM suite. Perhaps most critical, core Windows technologies - system updates, network management (such as required VPN use and Wi-Fi access point binding), and Azure Active Directory join - are good to go. 1 2 3 volgende » Gerelateerde vragen Na update 1 november instabiel WiFi op laptop.

Nexus 5X users have taken to official Nexus Help Forum to report the issues and Google has now acknowledged the issue claiming "this is strictly a hardware related issue." Notably, the Android 7.0 Nougat update to some Nexus 5X owners cause a hardware issue that cannot be fixed via an over-the-update and needs to be taken to LG centres for repair or exchange, if possible. Nexus 5X users in the meanwhile have tried a lot of workarounds to get out of the reboot loop but haven't been able to fix the issue. One of the users in a forum post wrote, "Installed nougat over the air yesterday and since then random reboots occur. I created the cache partition but no luck. Did a factory reset but problem still there." Some users have even tried wiping the system cache partition and factory data reset from settings but the problem is still there.A Googler named Orrin has replied on the forum to increasing number of queries about Nexus 5X issue and claims that it affects "a very small number of users." "We understand that a very small number of users are experiencing a bootloop issue on the Nexus 5X. We are continuing to investigate the situation, but can confirm that this is strictly a hardware related issue. For those of you that are currently experiencing this, please contact your place of purchase for warranty or repair options. We're sorry for the inconvenience and appreciate your continued patience," wrote Orrin on forum. To recall, Google's latest Android 7.0 Nougat operating system started rolling out to several Nexus devices including the Nexus 5X last month. Google recommends, "If you purchased your Nexus 5X on the Google Store, contact us for information about refunds, exchanges, or repairs." For others, Google notes, "If you didn't purchase your Nexus 5X on the Google Store, visit the LG website at www.lg.com/. You may be covered by LG's limited manufacturer's warranty."

Allo launched yesterday, the first platform to be integrated with Google’s new intelligent agent, Google Assistant. Google had announced at the I/O conference earlier this year that Allo would not be saving messages on its own servers, but that is not the case with the final application. The reason for saving the communications in Google servers is apparently to improve Google Assistant, which is a win for machine learning, but a loss for privacy. However, upon request, Google can make the data available to law enforcement agencies. These concerns over security prompted Snowden to tweet out a warning against using the newly launched app. What is #Allo? A Google app that records every message you ever send and makes it available to police upon request. https://t.co/EdPRC0G7Py — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016 There were a flurry of responses. Some of these posed the question to Snowden, which instant messaging app is safest to use. Snowden’s messaging client of choice is Signal. Use Tor. Use Signal. https://t.co/VLvBsbVHKs — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016 The danger that Snowden is trying to point out here is that while Google may be officially claiming to log the chats to improve its own Artificial Intelligence offerings, the choice was made knowing that the private communications would be made available to law enforcement agencies upon request. Allo works as a surrogate mass surveillance system, because Google simply hands over user data when enforcement agencies request it. Thinking about #Allo? Last year, our secret court approved 100% of requests for surveillance. They would cover Allo. https://t.co/oYtc3Pu8tx — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016 Allo does have an incognito mode for secure conversations. The messages are not saved on a central server, and there is a timer that allows destruction of sent messages in as little as five seconds. A messaging client such as WhatsApp that by default does not save messages in its own servers is a more secure option, as there is no data saved to comply with requests by law enforcement agencies.

Rungta had joined housing.com, run by Locon Solutions Pvt. Ltd., from Reliance Jio in November last year. Rungta has previously worked at Google, Yebhi.com, Yatra.com and McCann Erickson. In 2009, he was named Google’s first India CMO, a position he held for four years. Rungta’s LinkedIn profile indicates that he started working with Intuit in September. An email sent to Rungta for a comment did not elicit any response at the time of writing this report. Realty portal housing.com has been in the news for about two years now. From public potshots by then chief executive and co-founder Rahul Yadav, directed at the company’s investors and board members, which led to his ouster later, to high cash burn. The once revered startup has been struggling to get back up on its feet. Yadav later started an e-governance startup Intelligent Interfaces, which received undisclosed amount of funding from Flipkart founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal and cricketer Yuvraj Singh’s YouWeCan, but fizzled out soon after. After Yadav, Jason Kothari was appointed the chief executive of Housing.com in November 2015. Under his supervision, the company shut down a few verticals and decided to focus only on online property sale. It also withdrew from many cities and cut its workforce from around 2,000 to a little below 1,200. In January, Housing, raised another $15 million from existing investor Softbank, bringing its total investment to $135 million. Its other investors include Nexus Venture Partners, Helion Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, Snapdeal founders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal. Co-founder Advitiya Sharma quit housing.com in March this year to start his venture Genius Learning Lab, which is planning to start 500 technology-led ‘micro schools’ across five cities. Prior to that, three other co-founders – Abhishek Anand, Ravish Naresh and Sanat Ghosh left housing.com to start a new venture. Over the past year, multiple reports have appeared claiming housing.com is in talks with ecommerce giant Snapdeal and rival PropTiger for an acquisition. Housing.com competes with MagicBricks and 99acres, besides a host of others including PropTiger. News Corp, which owns 30% of PropTiger, acquired Mosaic Media Ventures Pvt Ltd, the parent website.

File Photo Tensions remain high in the region over conflicting territorial claims over the strategically important Spratlys chain. Taipei, Sep 22:   Taiwan’s defence ministry has asked Google to blur images of a new development believed to be for military use on a disputed South China Sea island. Tensions remain high in the region over conflicting territorial claims, particularly over the strategically important Spratlys chain. Taiwan administers Taiping island, which is the largest in the Spratlys archipelago. The island chain is also claimed in part or whole by the Philippines, Vietnam and China. Google satellite images show a circular structure with four Y-shaped attachments, jutting out to sea on Taiping’s northwestern coast. The development comes after Taiwan last year inaugurated a solar-powered lighthouse, an expanded airstrip and a pier as part of efforts to strengthen defence capabilities on Taiping. The defence ministry said it was in the process of contacting Google Thursday to ask them to blur the satellite images, but would not comment further on what the structures are. “It is classified information,” the ministry’s spokesman Chen Chung-chi said when asked the reason for the request to Google, which was made after images of the structures surfaced in local media. Fears over possible military confrontation in the area have grown since an international tribunal ruling in July which rejected Beijing’s sweeping claims to almost all of the South China Sea — even waters approaching coasts of the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations. China outlines its territory using a vague map that emerged in the 1940s, resulting in an overlap with Taiwan’s claims. The two sides split in 1949 after a civil war on the mainland, but Beijing still sees Taiwan as part of its territory. Beijing angrily vowed to ignore the verdict from the tribunal in The Hague, prompting a warning from US President Barack Obama who emphasised that the ruling was binding. Crucially for Taipei, the ruling stated that Taiping was legally a “rock” that did not give it an exclusive economic zone, undermining its claims to the surrounding waters. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen, who has yet to visit the island since taking office in May, has said the verdict “severely jeopardised” Taiwan’s rights. Her predecessor Ma Ying-jeou visited Taiping in January to press Taiwan’s claims, a move that triggered criticism from the US as well as protests from Vietnam and the Philippines. Tensions have also been stoked by China’s rapid development of reefs in the South China Sea into artificial islands capable of hosting military planes.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Thursday November 17, 2016 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode VR app lets you see through the eyes of person with dementia Tim Biggs 22 Sep 2016, 2:35 p.m. A new virtual reality app that puts users in the position of a person living with dementia has been released for Google's Cardboard VR platform. VR app lets you see through the eyes of person with dementia Carers trying out EDIE at the Alzheimer's Australia launch event in Melbourne. Photo: Arsineh Houspian A screenshot from the EDIE VR app. Dr Ron Petersen from the Mayo Clinic in the US tries out the EDIE app at the launch event. Photo: Arsineh Houspian Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit A new virtual reality app that puts users in the position of a person living with dementia has been released for Google's Cardboard VR platform. Called EDIE (pronounced Eddy put standing for Educational Dementia Immersive Experience), the app was launched on Thursday by Alzheimer's Australia Vic, and is available free on Android and iPhone. Dr Tanya Petrovich, manager of business development at Alzheimer's Australia Vic, says the app was designed to build empathy and make people more aware of the issues faced by those living with Dementia. "The idea is you step into the shoes of a person named Edie, who's living at home with his wife, and who is living with dementia", Petrovich says. When Edie gets up in the middle of the night and has to go to the bathroom, players see the world through his eyes. Petrovich says that many people think of Alzheimer's as only affecting the memory, but that it actually has a much broader range of symptoms. With EDIE, the user will get an approximation of the changes in sensory perception that may be experienced by a person living with dementia. "Perception is a really big issue", Petrovich says. "For you and me a pattern is easy to distinguish, but for a person living with dementia a pattern can appear to be moving, or it could even appear to be an animal. It could appear to be cockroaches or ants". It might even appear that a larger animal or person is in the room, when in reality it's just a pattern on the wall, Petrovich said. She added that while this is known to happen to some people living with dementia, every person is different and symptoms vary. In addition to memory, dementia can affect mood, language, problem solving and the ability to plan, although a virtual reality platform presents an ideal way to explain its effect on perception. Petrovich says the free app is an example of the kind of tool Alzheimer's Australia uses when training carers. Later this year, a workshop called Enabling Edie will use the app as a training tool. Carers will experience the same scene featured in the public version but with a second scene that shows how, after his carer makes a few changes, the environment could become more supportive for Edie. EDIE can be used with any VR viewer compatible with Cardboard. A number of low-cost viewers can be purchased through Google, and Alzheimer's Australia Vic is selling its own EDIE branded viewer for $15. September is Dementia Awareness Month. Help and more information can be found at fightdementia.org.au/vic or by calling the National Dementia Helpline on 1800 100 500. Home carers and health professionals interested in signing up for the EDIE workshop can do so at vic.fightdementia.org.au/edie.

The revelation of new military-related construction could raise tensions in the contested waterway where mainland China’s building of airstrips and other facilities has worried other claimants and the United States. Taiwan’s new facilities on Taiping Island may have military use The images seen on Google Earth show four three-pronged structures sitting in a semi-circle just off the northwestern shoreline of Taiping, also known as Itu Aba, across from an upgraded airstrip and recently constructed port that can dock 3,000-tonne frigates. “Under the precondition of protecting military secrets and security, we have requested Google blur images of important military facilities,” Taiwan Defence Ministry spokesman Chen Chung-chi said on Wednesday, after local media published the images on Itu Aba. The United States has urged against the militarisation of the South China Sea, following the rapid land reclamation by China on several disputed reefs through dredging and building air fields and port facilities. Taiwan’s defence ministry and coastguard, which directly oversees Itu Aba, said details about the structures were confidential and have not commented on their nature. Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, said it was reviewing the request from Taiwan, but that to date such requests have not resulted in Google blurring imagery. Tsai Ing-wen tells warship crew to defend Taiwan’s interests as they set off for island in South China Sea Satellite images used on Google Earth and Google Maps come from third-party providers, which Google purchases for use in its mapping system, according to the search giant. “We take security concerns very seriously and are always willing to discuss them with public agencies and officials,” Google spokesman Taj Meadows said in an emailed response. Defence experts in Taiwan said that based on the imagery of the structures and their semi-circular layout, the structures were likely related to defence and could be part of an artillery foundation. “I think definitely it will be for military purposes, but I cannot tell if it is for defending, attacking or monitoring,” said Dustin Wang, a scholar and a former government advisor who has regularly visited Taiping Island. Wang said given the structures’ location which faces the main seaborne traffic, they may relate to surveillance. Trouble in Taiwan: Hague ruling on Taiping Island gives Tsai her biggest headache Mainland China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei claim parts or all of the South China Sea, through which trillions of dollars in trade passes. An international court ruled against China in July in a case brought by the Philippines that rejected China’s claim to a vast swathes of the disputed maritime area. Both mainland China and Taiwan, which China views as a breakaway province, vehemently rejected the court ruling.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Beijing to interpret Basic Law over Hong Kong legislative oath controversy, senior adviser confirms 2 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election 3 Hong Kong government has not been told if Beijing will intervene to ban pro-independence lawmakers 4 Xi Jinping warns Communist Party would be ‘overthrown’ if Taiwan’s independence push left unchecked 5 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US Shared 1 Beijing to interpret Basic Law over Hong Kong legislative oath controversy, senior adviser confirms 2 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 3 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 4 The C-word: why Hong Kong localists have offended all Chinese 5 Xi Jinping warns Communist Party would be ‘overthrown’ if Taiwan’s independence push left unchecked Commented 1 Hong Kong oath-taking saga shows ugly side of city’s colonial legacy 2 Beijing to interpret Basic Law over Hong Kong legislative oath controversy, senior adviser confirms 3 Xi Jinping warns Communist Party would be ‘overthrown’ if Taiwan’s independence push left unchecked 4 Lock them up: localist thugs have brought things to a new low with their mindless violence 5 Hong Kong government has not been told if Beijing will intervene to ban pro-independence lawmakers Promotions Order your FREE copy of Home Essentials 2017 now!

NEW! List your event for FREE! Jackson’s Oldest Classified Ad Site NEW: Vote in Our Polls Here! - September 22, 2016 Wyoming Chief Information Officer Takes Job with Google  by Jackson Hole. Media   Flint Waters has resigned as the Director of the Wyoming Department of Enterprise Technology Services and Chief Information Officer (CIO) for Wyoming to pursue a career with Google, effective September 23. “Flint’s talent and leadership cannot be replaced,” said Governor Mead. “His work consolidating IT in state government, putting together the Unified Network and the team he built at ETS are all examples of how much he accomplished, not only to improve state government and our schools, but also to get Wyoming recognized nationally as a technology leader. I’m proud that Google recognized our Wyoming guy’s talent. He will be Google’s first Wyoming employee. Google clearly values ability and innovators. They landed an all-star.” Mr. Waters worked for the Wyoming Department of Criminal Investigation (DCI) and a private software company prior to his appointment as CIO in April 2011. At DCI he designed software for use in identifying on-line child predators that is now widely used by law enforcement across the world. “Serving Wyoming has been an immense honor,” said Mr. Waters. “Delivering Governor Mead’s vision for technology was a daunting task, but the state employees at ETS are a cut above and they have delivered. I will forever be grateful for their support and Governor Mead’s faith in me as I move on to Google.” Leave a comment Cancel reply Comment * Name * Email * Mountain Weather Static Peak, LLC

These methods have become known as black-hat techniques. The topic titled 'SEO is dead' is a common forum discussion topic found on the web that has now been replaced with white-hat SEO techniques. So what are white-hat SEO techniques for 2016? These techniques are what we, as a media company, do every day. We create quality content and build relationships with influential press to get the content published. Have you heard of the Skyscraper SEO technique? Well it's basically PR (content creation) with a digital spin: First you research top content being shared on a specific topic Second you see who's publishing the content by using a variety of tools Third you write an article on the desired topic but take a different angle by adding a local spin or more up-to-date facts or interesting points. Fourth you send the article to the publisher website (such as a news service) explaining the content. Most times, if the content is published, it will be back-linked to your website. This is gold!Companies that are able to embrace this technique will have a long future in the digital age by sending traffic to their clients’ website and getting their clients’ sites ranked on search engines. Good content is truly king. But not all social media companies are able to write good content. They find it difficult to do the work of a good journalist. The three most important SEO factors are: Content published on high-ranking news media websites Your own website content shared on social media platforms Backlinks.PR can be a huge help in getting this right. Don't think PR is dying, PR is evolving and it's an exciting time to be in PR, but only with the necessary knowledge of what Google requires and good-quality journalism. ‹    Like Save Email Print PDF Advertisement Follow Connect (Christopher Smith knows me) Colleague Weve done business together Weve worked together Met in person Interacted with online Classmate Friend Family Follow only Create new group Christopher Smith's articles About Christopher SmithChristopher Smith is MD of Sha-Izwe Communications, a media relations and social media marketing company.

Daydream VR ready Manufacturer: Google Review Price: £599.99 What is the Google Pixel? The Google Pixel is a landmark device, signalling the first proper foray into phones by the search engine giant. And boy, has it done a good job. The Pixel is available in two sizes – the smaller one reviewed here and a larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL – and has one of the best cameras on any phone, along with a software experience that's better than any other Android device. You have to pay a premium for these features – this certainly isn’t a Nexus-priced device – but it’s far from the first phone to cost a pretty penny. And when it’s this good, it’s worth paying that bit extra. Related: Our review of Daydream View – the best mobile VR headset? Google Pixel – Design The least exciting part about the whole idea of the Google Pixel is its design. I know many people who dislike it completely, but I find it perfectly serviceable. It isn't as flashy as Samsung’s Galaxy S7, but it's much nicer than than the latest batch of iPhones. The body is made from metal and glass – pretty much a given these days – and it tapers down ever so slightly on the rear to help avoid any unnecessary camera bumps. A circular fingerprint sensor sits below the camera sensor, and both are encased in a divisive glass panel that runs about a third of the way down the back. Some in the TrustedReviews' office hate it, but I think it adds some flair, catching the light nicely. It is a fingerprint magnet and scratches very easily, however. Related: iPhone vs Pixel Google Pixel and Pixel XL video review Unlike Apple, Google includes a 3.5mm headphone jack – but I’d have preferred for it to have been placed at the bottom rather than the top of the phone. In addition, Google has used a wide bezel above and below the screen – just like the iPhone. It would have been good to see this space used for a pair of front-facing speakers – maybe this will come with the Pixel 2. The sides are heavily chamfered, and this helps the device to fit comfortably in your hand. This is one of the easiest phones to hold, helped by the fact it isn’t overly thin. It’s also completely usable in one hand, something that can’t be said for the larger Pixel XL. It’s roughly the same size as an iPhone 7, just a little taller and marginally thicker. Google Pixel – Display 5-inch displays are becoming a rarity in the Android space, but for many they provide the perfect mix of portability and size. However, the problem – aside from the dearth of choice – is that smaller phones tend to be hamstrung by weak components and a lack of features. Thankfully, this isn’t the case here. This is a 5-inch display phone with the innards of a larger device – and that’s great news. The Pixel's display is fantastic, comfortably one of the best at this size. It’s an AMOLED panel – the same tech Samsung uses on its Galaxy series – with a 1080p resolution. This isn't as high as the larger Pixel XL and its quad-HD panel, but due to its smaller size you really won’t notice the difference. It’s pin-sharp with zero jagged edges around icons when you’re looking at it from a normal distance. Get right up close, with your eye almost touching the screen, and you might notice a tiny bit of pixellation around the battery icons and on-screen buttons. Realistically, though, you won't be using the phone from such a distance. Buy Now: Google Pixel at Amazon.com from $880 Best Deals for Google Pixel Compare plans I only question Google's decision to use a 1080p panel here when it comes to VR. With the upcoming Daydream View headset using the phone display, the experience might be worse on the Pixel's lower-resolution screen as opposed to the Pixel XL. I haven’t had the opportunity to use them together yet, so will keep my thoughts open until I do. Related: What is Daydream View? Everything else about the screen is great. Since it's AMOLED, there’s a lovely kick to the colours, yet saturation looks accurate. Often these display types overblow reds and greens, but they look fine here. Blacks, too, are deep and inky – although there's a slight grey tinge to the Pixel when it's placed side-by-side with the Pixel XL or a Samsung Galaxy S7. Viewing angles are great, brightness is excellent, and the auto-brightness is easily the best I have used on Android.

Goodbye privacy By Online desk  |   Published: 22nd September 2016 01:43 PM  |   Last Updated: 22nd September 2016 01:43 PM  |   A+A A-   |   0 Share Via Email As the latest entrant into the instant messenger platform, Google Allo has been raking in the downloads, and along with it has been brewing a controversy over its retaining of users' chat data on its servers. Ever since Google made the announcement in May regarding the chat messenger and its video chat app brother 'duo', there has been privacy concerns raised about the storing of users' chat data on its servers for all non-incognito chats. This depending on which country you live in, your chats would turn out to be electronic evidence which could be used against you by law enforcement and courts,unless you chat incognito. Earlier this year, whistle blower Edward Snowden too had asked users to stay away from this platform while questioning Google on why end-to-end encryption is not enabled by default Google has said that some changes have been made from earlier announced to accommodate the smart assistant reply feature which would use data patterns and chat history to preempt smart conversations between users using the Messenger's smart assistant features. As compared to its video chat brother 'duo'  which offers end-to-end encryption, Allo doesn't encrypt user data and chats by default as compared to Whatsapp and other instant messenger platforms like Telegram. Google will store almost all the chat data on its servers unless the users choose to chat in incognito mode or the user deletes the chats, according to reports in technology website, The Verge.

Gavin Fernandonews.com.au@GavinDFernando Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend IMAGES of mysterious new constructions on a disputed Taiwanese island have prompted the country’s government into damage control mode. The Taiwanese government has asked Google to blur satellite images of Itu Aba, the country’s sole holding in the disputed South China Sea, after aerial shots surfaced of mysterious new constructions on the region’s border. The photos, which are currently still visible on Google Earth, show four tetrapod structures set up in a semicircle just off the northwestern shoreline of the island, around three or four storeys high. Another view of the mysterious constructions.Source:Supplied The images have prompted speculation over what exactly is being housed there, and whether China and Taiwan are planning on taking joint aggressive action over the disputed region. A spokesman for Taiwan Defence Ministry confirmed they wanted evidence of the structures hidden, saying: “Under the precondition of protecting military secrets and security, we have requested Google blur images of important military facilities.” But other than that, Taiwan remains tight-lipped on the subject, refusing to delve into the structures’ purpose. The request to Google came shortly after reports speculated the structures could be blockhouse towers for anti-aircraft gun installations. But Taiwan’s Defence Minister Feng Shih-kuan would not confirm or deny these reports. “It is inconvenient for us to reveal any military facilities we are installing on Taiping Island and what their purposes are as they are all considered secrets,” he told reporters. He also assured the public that “Taiping Island has strong defensive capability”. The objects were not on the previous map taken by satellite in January last year, meaning they’re a relatively new construction. The country’s silence prompts further speculation that Taipei may be ramping up its defence after an international ruling on the disputed area in July. Both China and Taiwan, which China views as a renegade province, vehemently rejected the court ruling. China and Taiwan could be ramping up their defence in the South China Sea following the international tribunal in July.Source:AP Whatever it is, the objects are clearly sensitive in nature, and the government isn’t too keen on the rest of the world knowing about them. Military experts have speculated that the constructions are most likely defensive in nature, saying Taipei is likely to be working on building its intelligence and surveillance capabilities. A security expert from Macquarie University told news.com.au it was difficult to pinpoint exactly what the structures are, but ruled out some of the speculation based on the satellite image. “They’re too small and in a strange pattern to be harbours or ports,” he said. “They could house sensors for surveillance, but the southern most structure doesn’t point out to sea.” He also suggested they may house coastal artillery, but added this wasn’t likely. “(If so), you’d expect them scattered around the entire island, and not concentrated in one place.” Cannon bases have likewise been ruled out, given that the surrounding saltwater would be likely to rust the material. Macau-based military expert Antony Wong Dong said they were most likely to be large coastal forts set up for defensive purposes, but warned they could be equipped with heavy machineguns. “The surrounding area ... is the most suitable landing beach on Taiping. Such kinds of construction were only found in Germany during the World War II and Taiwan,” he told the South China Morning Post. “The coastal forts can effectively stop vessels from Vietnam or even deter mainland warships from landing on Taiping.” Google has confirmed that it received the request from the Taiwanese government and is currently reviewing it.
