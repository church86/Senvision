Channeling the same playful vibe the designer goes for in fashion, the cases are colorful and cartoonish. The cases are plastered with emojis and cartoon characters we’re sure would attract the younger crowd. There are also companion live wallpapers that will rotate through each emoji every day. These can even be animated with a shake of the phone. Aside from that, Google is offering a sticker pack from Jeremy Scott on its Allo app. The cases are made for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 6P with prices starting at US$40 (about CA$55). These can be designed through Google’s case maker, too. There are nine color and emoji case choices you can mix and match. You can even control the zoom level and rotation.

S Aadeetya November 12, 2016, 3:34 pm Buyers of Google Pixel phone in India face an anxious wait to know where they are going to get their service support. We all know that the Google Pixel phone has been manufactured by HTC, so it was reasonable to assume that HTC would be taking care of any after-sales service of Google’s first high-end phone. But as it turns out, HTC is yet to officially confirm with its consumers in the country. So, The Quint decided to go ahead and check with HTC’s PR team. Much to our surprise, they said HTC is not willing to comment on this aspect right now. HTC is not willing to comment on matter with respect to Google Pixel phone.HTC’s PR Team, India So, what happens to those who’ve bought Google’s premium Android phone? We really hope that HTC comes out publicly to offer its support services for the Pixel series. After all, nobody would want to face service hassles, that too after paying almost the same as for an Apple iPhone. Google, at its Pixel launch event, had promised luxury service support – but that was limited to the US, UK and other parts of Europe. Leaving India out of the list could be a big deal-breaker for prospective Pixel phone buyers.

Well, since the software is the best of Android, you may think that they could be good or at least commendable when it comes to security. But it looks like they are not. Yes, if your smartphone gets hacked within 60 seconds, would you call it a secure device? Not in my dictionary at least. Well, yes, that’s the case here with the Google Pixel. At the PwnFest hacking competition which was held yesterday in Seoul, a white-hat hacker group, called Qihoo 360 demonstrated an interesting hack. It was targetted towards the so called best of Android software running Google Pixel handset. And guess what? They successfully hacked the device within 60 seconds and filled their pockets with a cash prize of $120,000. And yes, they also gave a lot of work to Google’s security experts. The Qihoo 360 team demonstrated an exploit that allowed for remote code execution on the Pixel. They used a zero vulnerability to remotely install the code onto the device. Now if you ask how severe is this hack? Well, if someone is able to remotely access your device, then i would say it is a matter of concern. The exploit which they demonstrated, launched the Google Play Store after that the Google’s mobile version of the Chrome web browser and then a message which reads “Pwned by 360 Alpha Team.” Although they didn’t do anything with the device, it was indeed quite clear that the attacker can have full access to the device along with the full list of permissions. This means that all your user data including the contacts, messages, emails, multimedia files and everything else which you want to keep to yourself can go out in the wild for everyone to know. If this isn’t scary enough, then probably you should not worry about it then. But it is definitely worth noting that this group of hackers came out of the event with a total of $520,000 cash prize since they demonstrated other vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 and one in Adobe Flash. On the other hand, if this scares you, then there is a good news for you. Since these are a bunch of white-hat hackers, they make money by selling such information about the vulnerabilities to the responsible and the concerned parties. And in this case, the responsible party is Google. And we are pretty sure that by this time, they are already working on a patch for the same or if not, we at least hope that they will start working one soon. We don’t have any word from Google on this as of now, hence we suggest you stay tuned for more info.

Post an ad Tech review: Google's entry into smartphone design has some very cool features By: jim rossman Tribune News Service November 14, 2016 0 Caption + Caseology Introduces Stylish Cases for Google Pixel and Pixel XL (PRNewsFoto/Caseology) I always thought Google was missing out on a great opportunity in not having its own phone to take advantage of its Android operating system. Apple learned early on that controlling entire hardware and software systems was the way to go, but Google seemed content to just work on the software end. Sure, there were a few forgettable Google-branded Nexus phones, but they were far from the best Android handsets. Now Google has decided to dive in head-first and design its own phones, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. HTC is building the phones, but the design is all Google's. Let's get one thing out of the way first - Google's Pixel looks like an iPhone. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Apple has sold millions of iPhones, and the design and look are proven hits. But even though it looks like an iPhone and costs the same as the iPhone (starting at $650), there are hardware differences that are worth mentioning. Hardware and specs I've been using the non-XL Pixel for the last few weeks, so my hands-on thoughts will focus on the smaller version. The Pixel is built around a 5-inch AMOLED screen made from Corning Gorilla Glass 4 with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (441 pixels per inch). It runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor with four gigabytes of RAM and ships with 32 gigabytes or 128 gigabytes of storage. The sleep-wake button is high on the right edge, but the volume rocker button is also on the right. This put all the buttons comfortably under your thumb (if you're right-handed). The big difference in the Pixel's design is the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the phone's back, which happens to be exactly where my index finger rests when I'm holding the phone. Putting the fingerprint reader on the back isn't really better or worse than the iPhone's front placement - it's a matter of taste. Because the Pixel chose the back, I have to pick up the phone to unlock it with my finger. I do find I keep my iPhone lying on my desk, so I am able to just touch my finger to the reader without picking up the phone to check a message or text. The body is made of aluminum, but the top third of the phone's backside is also glass. The main camera has a 12-megapixel sensor and an f/2.0 lens. The front camera has an 8-megapixel sensor with an f/2.4 lens. The camera is top-notch. The Pixel is on par with Apple's iPhone 7 or Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. I can't say enough nice things about the camera on the Pixel. I also love invoking the camera app by a quick double flip of the phone or double tapping the sleep-wake button. Google also includes unlimited cloud storage for all photos and videos taken with the Pixel. The charger is USB-C, which seems to be where the world is headed (except for iPhones). The Pixel's USB-C port uses the faster USB 3.0, which means much faster transfers. According to Google, 15 minutes of USB-C charging from the included 18-watt power supply will provide seven hours of power. The Pixel's physical dimensions are 5.6 inches by 2.7 inches by 0.2 inches, and it weighs 5.04 ounces. It's about a quarter of an inch longer than my iPhone 6s. The 2,770 ampere-hour battery easily lasted a day for my use. You'll find the usual radios - 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 along with near field communication. There are a few features you won't find on the Pixel, including water resistance and stereo speakers (there's just one). There is no slot for adding storage, and the Pixel does not have wireless charging. Android in all its glory You may have used Android phones before, but you really haven't used Android as Google intended. Different wireless carriers and phone manufacturers put their own software on top of Android, often cluttering up the landscape. The Pixel runs pure, unadulterated Android 7.1, and it's the only phone to feature Google's new Assistant. Simply say "OK, Google," and you'll invoke the Google Assistant, which will answer questions, manage tasks, find photos, entertain you and help you stay on schedule. I think Google's Assistant is much better than Apple's Siri. You can have an actual conversation with Assistant. I asked the Assistant how to get to a local park, and the directions from my location were displayed on a Google map. Then I asked, "When was it built?" and the Assistant brought up an article about the park and when it was built. Very cool. There are some other Android tweaks you'll notice. I had to look up the way you call up the app list on the Pixel. With other Android phones, you'll have an icon to bring up all the apps. On the Pixel, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up the apps. The apps are also pretty uniform in their appearance. All the included app icons are round. Third-party apps still can be shaped differently, but I like the round look. Overall the phone was very snappy and responsive. Conclusions I'm really happy Google has decided to get into the phone game. The company has the most popular operating system, and it's about time it designed its own hardware to take advantage of it. I'm a longtime iPhone user, so I'm a sucker for the design. I'm still on the fence about the fingerprint sensor placement. There is a lot to like about the Pixel and Pixel XL. I realize this isn't an in-depth review, but there are plenty of places online to find those. The Pixel is a hit with me, and it joins the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy 7 phones in the top tier of handsets. I can't wait to see what Google does with the next version of the Pixel. The Pixel costs $649 and the XL costs $769 for the 32gb model. Add $100 to each to increase the storage to 128gb. They are available from Google, Verizon stores or Best Buy. You might see commercials or websites that say the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive, but that's just for sales. If you buy the Pixel through Google, it's unlocked for use on any carrier. - Jim Rossman writes for The Dallas Morning News; email him at jrossman@dallasnews.com.

However, there is a catch to this deal. In order to make the cut, you need to first buy any of Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL or the LG V20 on the carrier’s monthly plan. Once this is done, you should be able to get the chance to buy another device similar to what bought at half the price. In case you don’t feel like getting a second Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, for instance, you also have the option to pick any other device of the same price tag or a lesser value. Keep in mind that this deal has nothing to with iPhones and it only involves the five Android flagships mentioned. Verizon Wireless has not mentioned when this deal will expire, but as usual, don’t expect it to last long enough. As a result, you need to hurry before it expires, just in case you really want a new flagship at half the normal price. Just to remind you, Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge come with 5.1-inch and 5.5-inch AMOLED screens with QHD resolutions, but the latter has a curved edge-to-edge screen as opposed to the flat screen found on the former. Both screens are protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4 and you also get IP68 water and dust resistance certification. Under the hood, both Samsung Galaxy S7 phones have a Snapdragon 820 alongside 4GB RAM and 32GB of storage. You also get the same 12MP and 5MP camera combination on both alongside support for microSD card storage, microUSB ports, 3.5mm headphone jack, fingerprint scanner as well as a 3000mAh and 3600mAh battery unit on the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, respectively. Both units are still using Android Marshmallow, but they are eligible for the new Galaxy Beta Program that brings the preview version of Android Nougat on board. As for the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, you get newer processors than what is used on the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. There is a Snapdragon 821 SoC on both models, but the same 4GB RAM is retained. You get two storage options of 32GB and 128GB, but the high-end models are already out of stock, especially for the Pixel XL. Like the S7 and S7 Edge, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL have different screen sizes of 5 inches and 5.5 inches, however, it is only the latter that comes with QHD resolution. The Google Pixel phones have the same 12MP and 8MP sensors on the rear and front cameras, respectively. The smaller Pixel also packs a smaller battery of 2770mAh as compared to the 3450mAh unit used on the Pixel XL. The two phones run Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box and support the newer USB-C connectivity. Lastly, the LG V20 comes in with a 5.7-inch QHD LCD screen as the main screen, but you also get a 2.1-inch secondary screen with the same resolution. Under the hood, the V20 packs a Snapdragon 820 SoC, the same version used on the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, alongside the same 4GB RAM. However, the phablet has 64GB of onboard storage in addition to a microSD card slot. The LG V20 was the first device to come preinstalled with Android Nougat, even ahead of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. The phone also offers a better camera setup than any of the other models here, boasting a dual-lens system on the back with 16MP and 8MP sensors. On the front, the phone has a 5MP sensor. LG V20 has a removable battery of 3200mAh, which is another unique feature of this great phone. You can check out these deals on the official Verizon Wireless website.

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Apple Pokemon Go Update Science Donald Trump Google Pixel Update: More Bad News Why This Phone Sucks Cameron First Posted: Nov 13, 2016 02:02 PM EST Qihoo 360 members hacked the Google Pixel under 60 seconds Credit:DnewS/YouTube After the fall of the infamous Samsung Galaxy S7, Apple's iPhone 7 took Samsung Galaxy 7's crown as the world's finest phone of 2016. A few weeks later, Google Pixel emerged and was believed to rival Apple's iPhone 7, but fell short after its release. Since then, Google Pixel has been receiving non-stop bad reviews and here is the latest: Google Pixel Hacked In Less Than 60 Seconds At PwnFest 2106 According to a written article at BGR, the annual PwnFest was held in Seoul. This is a bug pwning "festival" for better security organized by PC with the help of sponsors, vendors, and judges. Don't worry, they don't aim to inspire people to be criminals and hack tech companies. In the PwnFest hacking competition, a group of Chinese White-Hat hackers from Qihoo 360 presented the ability to achieve RCE (remote code execution) to gain control of the Google Pixel smartphone. To acquire the RCE, the group demonstrated a POC (proof of concept) that uses a zero-day vulnerability. They showed how easy it was for them to install malicious codes on Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. In doing so, the team was able to successfully launch the Play Store app before opening a webpage on Google Chrome that read "Pwned By 360 Alpha Team," and won a cash of $120,000. There Is More To It Despite how shocking it may seem (given that it has bad reviews), this is not the first time that the Google Pixel was hacked in a live event. During the Mobile Pwn2Own event in Japan, a group from Tencent, the Keen Team, demonstrated on how to hack the Google Pixel and gain the smartphone's data. Making the people realize how vulnerable the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL smartphones are. What Google plans to do Upon hearing this information, it is said that Google has already been informed and is planning to send a patch update for the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL smartphones. However, users of the Pixel phones are already growing impatient of Google's slow response. Aside from this "easily hacked" issue, there are already a number of issues that the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL smartphones has and has not yet been "fixed" by Google. Tech enthusiasts are already saying that Google's patch to fix the Pixel phone issues will be too late. And by that time, the Pixel phones will be a thing of that past and people will buy the upcoming smartphones instead. If you want to know more of the issues about the Google Pixel phones, here are some of the many issues that smartphone has to offer according to QZ.

A group of white hat hackers have actually managed to break into the Google smartphones. These hackers are from the Chinese security software company Qihoo 360. At the recently held 2016 PwnFest hacking competition in Seoul, the hackers got into Google's new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphone in lees than a minute. They have also won a cash prize of $120,000 for this. A similar hacking challenge was launched by Google in September this year.   Google has recently announced 'The Project Zero Prize' contest wherein it is offering two smartphones Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X for hacking. The goal of this contest is to find a vulnerability or bug chain that achieves remote code execution on multiple Android devices knowing only the devices’ phone number and email address.

Both the carrier and Google are blaming the unexpected high demand as the culprit for the change.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google and Verizon have underestimated the demand for the Google Pixel smartphones. Last month, preorders were already starting to get sold out and this week, the carrier has been telling those who purchased the Pixel XL 128 GB variant that they will have to wait for two more weeks. 128 GB Google Pixel XL: Delayed And Sold Out Information about the shipment delay surfaced after users who were supposed to receive their Pixel XL on Nov. 11 began grumbling about a Verizon notification informing them of the additional delay. The note, which came by way of an email, began with an upbeat statement according to Phone Arena. "Looks like you have great taste," the letter said. Verizon then proceeded, saying that the Pixel XL is quite popular; stocks have been wiped out. So, for some devices that should have shipped last Friday, the new delivery schedule is Nov. 26. There is no official word yet about the number of delayed shipments but, with the way things stand, the number is going to be bloody. One will probably recall that Verizon had already delayed the 128 GB Pixel XL rollout for its retail stores to Nov. 18. To make matters worse, this same Pixel variant is also getting wiped out of Google Store and Best Buy websites. So there would be droves of empty-handed customers, frustrated about the entire affair. Google Pixel XL Alternatives At this point, it is safe to say that, unless a consumer is willing to wait, he or she will have to settle for the 128 GB Google Pixel or 32 GB Pixel XL. These devices are still available at Verizon as of this writing. The 128 GB Pixel XL is still up for purchase, but the listed delivery date is now Dec. 26. Users should remember that, aside from the differences in screen size, resolution and battery capability, the Pixel and Pixel XL sport almost similar specifications. So it will not hurt to choose the smaller device. Some users may even find it to be more preferable than the 32 GB Pixel XL because both devices do not support expandable storage. But if you are really in the market for a top-of-the-line Android mobile device, you can also take a look at the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge or even the OnePlus 3. If you are amenable for a bit larger screen real estate, you could also go for the LG V20. On the iOS front, you only have the iPhone 6s Plus because the iPhone 7 Plus will also take several days to ship if you buy one today.

Best Buy Offers Great Discounts On Google’s Devices The retailer’s offers for the Google Pixel and the Pixel XL are the best ones so far on the market. Best buy is offering a $100 discount and a free Google Chromecast for the customers who ordered  either the Google Pixel or Pixel XL. Verizon Cuts The Prices On Google Pixel By 20% Nobody expected this great discount that Verizon offers to their customers. This is a great deal considering the fact that the Google Pixel costs $800. To take advantage of this promotion, all you have to do is to use the discount code “SAVE20” on Verizon’s website when you’re placing the order. After you enter the discount code, the price for the Google Pixel will be $520 and for the 128 GB version of the Pixel XL the price will drop from $870 to $690. Also, the customers who will purchase one of the two smartphones from Verizon Wireless will receive a Google Daydream View VR headset for free. This deals is similar to the one that Samsung is offering to their customers for the Galaxy S7 that will come along with a free Gear VR. There has been a recent Verizon Ad leak which suggests that on Black Friday, the retailer is planing to offer a $300 discount on both Google Pixel and Pixel XL. There Are Also Different Ways To Purchase The Device There are so many different options to purchase the latest Google devices but you’ll of course try to pick up the best one. If you’re having problems with the money, you can chose Google’s financing option. This plan will allow you to pay a monthly $27 fee for 24 months. These are just a few offers for Google’s new generation devices. In the upcoming weeks we expect to see more deals from retailers. Which smartphone would you purchase? Let us know in a comment below.

Google will need to bring a patch fast, to fix this vulnerability as soon as possible. Qihoo 360 found a hole in Google’s Pixel and it seems that’s it’s also present in the XL version of the flagship. Google didn’t know about it, so it shipped its devices before remediating the issue. The hackers have demonstrated the severity of this vulnerability using remote code execution. A special message was sent to the device and hackers clicked on it, triggering the attack. The Google Play Store and Google Chrome were opened and the latter showed a message reading “Pwned by 360 Alpha Team”. The attackers accessed the phone’s full list of permissions, as it was shown in the video, thanks to a rogue app install, leaving all data, such as multimedia, contacts and communication channels open to any form of exploitation. Thankfully, Qihoo 360 is a group of white-hat hackers and they don’t intend to do any harm, but they make money from selling information about vulnerabilities they find. These hackers have also found vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge and Adobe Flash and for demonstrating the vulnerability in the Pixel, they’ve won $520,000 at the event. Google’s new Pixels were released with battery problems and a Band 4 connectivity issue and they’re also missing some of the ambient notification tools that were introduced in the Nexus 6. In order to fill in the gap, a developer has released Ambi-Turner, which enables the ambient notification screen every time the device is taken out of the pocket or flipped over. There are many users who don’t like hitting the power button or the fingerprint scanner to see their current notifications and this free version of the application takes care of this problem.

The video details a handful of new features including App Shortcuts and new developer tools for live wallpapers. Other added features are the following: launcher shortcuts, refreshed round icons, Smart Storage for the storage manager, Google keyboard equipped with GIF support and newly added "restart" option in the power button menu. Aside from the mentioned updates, Tech Times listed more additional information on the upcoming features of the Android 7.1 Nougat. One is the Data Saver Mode, which will aid users to limit the use of data by their device. When Data Saver mode is turned on, apps will not be able to access mobile data in the background. In addition, the new app launcher allows users to create app shortcuts. Users have to long-press the app launcher to reveal the app and then tap on the app to reveal the associated shortcuts. In its "multiview" or "split screen mode," users are given the ability to split the screen in two and access two apps at once. Through this feature, customers can now keep watching a movie and text at the same time. Multi-screen view has been available on Samsung and LG re-skin versions of Android but the feature was never built in Android itself. However, it should be noted that some full-screen apps such as games are exempted from the feature. Another highlight of the update is the Google Assistant, a smart personal assistant that Google announced in May. Through this Android companion, customers can find out the capital or weather condition of a country of visit. Asking the personal assistant to play music, find restaurants, get directions are also possible actions. Through the Smart Storage feature of Android 7.1 Nougat, people will have more power in freeing spaces on their device. It works in the background and automatically removes older backed-up files such as videos and photos, which clears precious drive space and are still backed up in the cloud. Recently, Android 7.1 Nougat firmware is currently available on the Google Pixel while the Developer Preview of the OS can be installed on selected devices such as the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel C, among others.

Nonetheless, it hasn’t stopped the rumors from flooding in and taking different angles, with many still adamant that there is still time for the search engine giant to follow its impressive phones with a Google Nexus 7 2016 tablet. Previous rumors have indicated that the device will be released in the fourth quarter. Well, this is it and in fact, we only have about six weeks before the end of Q4 2016. Interestingly, Google is rumored to be planning to keep the Nexus 7 2016 as the name of this device despite the recent shift to the Pixel branding when it comes to the smartphone niche. However, these are not words from Google, but they are just speculations. As a result, don’t be surprised if Google unveiled a new tablet with a Pixel name, just like the current Pixel C tablet it already has. If indeed the Google Nexus 7 2016 tablet is released, it will be a tough battle for Apple as the tech giant is also rumored to be working on a new iPad Pro that should be released in March 2017. Like the former, the latter details are also based on speculations from market observers. According to leaked details, the Google Nexus 7 2016 tablet will come with flagship hardware and features. Among them is a QHD AMOLED display screen alongside the latest Snapdragon 820 SoC that is paired with 4GB RAM. There is talk of 64GB of inbuilt storage, a 5100mAh battery unit, and a 13MP rear snapper. Rather than run on the latest Android Nougat, the Nexus 7 2016 tablet is rumored to ship with Andromeda OS. As for now, it is hard to tell which company will be working together with Google in the production of the Nexus 7 2016 slate. However, it seems HTC and Huawei are the two main names in line for a berth in Google’s plans. Months ago, a Huawei official hinted at the company having plans to make another Google device, but now that the Pixel and Pixel XL are already out, with HTC reportedly being the OEM behind them, it remains to be seen whether the Chinese tech giant will take up the role of manufacturing the Google Nexus 7 2016. In terms of pricing, rumors claim that Google will price the Nexus 7 2016 affordably, but there is no mention of the exact price tag.

Home Auto Gadgets Hardware Internet IT Science Software Blogs Polls Submit News Blog: Gadgets Google’s Pixel, Pixel XL smartphones have a Bug Saimin (Blog) - November 13, 2016 1:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail According the Robin Sinha, even though it has the latest version of Android and has power packed hardware specifications, it seems that the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are not completely free of issues. During a recently held hackathon in Seoul Korea, a Chinese hacker group called Qihoo 360 targeted Google’s Pixel smartphone. The group, as reported by register website, exploited a zero-day vulnerability to gain remote access to the handset.   A zero–day vulnerability (ZDV), is a software flaw that is undisclosed and thus, it can be used by hackers.   When the vulnerability is exploited, a hacker reportedly able to access Google Play Store. This is before opening Google Chrome with a webpage that reads as ‘Pwned by 360 Alpha Team”.  The hackers showed how they obtained access to the Pixel, and Pixel XL’s contacts, Photos, Messages and call logs using a rogue app running in the background.   There is a rumor that this problem will be fixed in December’s Android security update. There had been complaints on Google’s Product Forums about the camera on the both the Pixel and Pixel XL. The complaint was that the smartphone’s camera shows an extreme amount of lens flare while taking photos in daylight. Google acknowledged the complaint and said that it will address the problem soon.     Lens flares are caused by either extreme light hitting directly into camera’s lens or light reflecting on the surface of the lens itself. Sometimes professional photographers use this error as an art effect.  Google is now working to fix the flare problem on it’s smartphones.   "Let's face it, we're not changing the world.

Verizon Wireless is the leading or rather the largest carrier in the U.S. and it is no surprise the mobile operator landed this deal. However, those who had pre-ordered their Google Pixel XL phones from the carrier will now have to wait a little bit longer before they can receive their flagship handset. In addition to this delay being specific to the larger Pixel XL, it is also exclusive to the high-end 128GB variant. The tech giant started sending out emails to those who were supposed to receive the Google Pixel XL starting Saturday. In the email, the company stated that the new shipping date will now be November 26th thanks to the fact that the model has run out of stock. This is the same case as what is happening with the same model via the Google Store and in fact, this was the first to run out of stock for the high-end model. The only other place you can get a Google Pixel XL phone, apart from Google Store and Verizon Wireless, is the Project Fi page. But it remains to be seen whether this section will also run into the same problems, especially after confirming earlier that the phone will start shipping somewhere towards the end of this week. The Google Pixel XL is the successor to the highly successful Nexus 6P. However, recent reports indicate that the former has seen quicker adoption than any other Nexus devices in the company’s recent history. Given that Verizon confirms this delay is as a result of excessive demand for the phones, it is easy to say that Google nailed it with this year’s flagship.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Get Google Pixel Fingerprint Gestures on Any Android Device Right Now By Uzair Ghani Posted 2 days ago 18Shares Share Tweet Submit Want the fancy new fingerprint gestures from Google Pixel on your Android device right now? You can, using an app from Google Play. ‘Fingerprint Gestures’ App Brings the Awesome Google Pixel Feature to Any Android Device – Download Now The Google Pixel has an awesome feature that allows a user to swipe their finger on the fingerprint sensor to invoke an action. For instance, if you swipe down on the sensor, you can bring into view the notifications shade. Swipe up and it’ll go away in a snap. It’s a handy little addition and something which Google is evaluating bringing to other fingerprint sensor-bearing Nexus devices using a software update. While we have no clue when said ROM will make the cut, all we know right now is that you can get those fingerprint gestures right away on your device if you happen to have a fingerprint sensor on your Android smartphone. The magic happens once you download the ‘Fingerprint Gestures’ app from Google Play, which luckily, happens to be free as well. But unlike the Pixel and Pixel XL gestures, this app takes things up a notch with a lot of customization options for users. For instance, rather than just sticking to controlling the notifications shade, you can customize a gesture to, let’s say, skip a song. You can even customize it to invoke the multitasking switcher if you so desire. There are even options to scroll up, scroll down and put your device to sleep, but they require your device to be rooted. Here’s a full list of actions you can utilize using this app: • Icon touch panel • Back • Home • Recent apps • Sleep (Root) • Power button menu • Scroll down (Root) • Scroll up (Root) • Open notifications panel • Toggle notifications panel • Open quick settings • Play/pause song • Next song • Previous song • App • Torch • Toggle ringer mode • Toggle split screen Advertisement Like I mentioned above, your device needs to have a built-in fingerprint sensor in order for this app to work. Furthermore, your Android smartphone must be running at least Marshmallow. Anything below just won’t cut it. Last but not the least, the app will work even if you are not rooted, but you’ll be left out of very minor features only. Prisma Photo Filter App Is Finally Available On Android Screenshots Wrap Up Download the app from the link below and do let us know what you think about it in the comments section. We are certain you’ll find this little package handy since it simplifies a lot of gestures which we initiate on a day to day basis, such as skipping a song or toggling ringer mode.

This is the same monthly update that is also rolling out to last year’s Google Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X as well as other Google devices, among them the Google Nexus 5 and Nexus 7. Dated November 5th, this is part of the monthly Android security update for both versions of Android Nougat installed on the two sets of Google devices. As you may know by now, the newer Pixel and Pixel XL are the only ones using a stable version of Android 7.1 Nougat. As for the rest, Android 7.0 Nougat is still in use, but those using the Google Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, and Pixel C tablet can access the beta version of the latest iteration. Like other monthly software updates from Google, the rolling-out November Android Nougat update brings the latest security patches, bug fixes as well as software tweaks that are aimed at keeping the Nexus and Pixel devices safe. Supported Google devices The latest November Android Nougat Security Bulletin is huge and it comes with more than just bug fixes and security patches. As such, it will be available for a huge number of Google devices, including the LG-made Nexus 5 and the Nexus 7 (2013). Those using the Nexus Player, Nexus 9 as well as Nexus 6 should also be receiving this OTA update on their devices. As far as the release dates are concerned, supported devices, especially the newer models of Google Pixel and Pixel XL alongside the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X should be receiving the OTA notifications anytime, if not already. You also have the option of going through the Settings of the phone and tap on About phone. From here, you can check for the updates manually. Keep in mind that this update is not available for those using Android 7.1 Nougat beta on Google Nexus 6P or Nexus 5X.  However, those using the stable version of this OS on Google Pixel and Pixel XL are in line to receive the update.

A new feature offered by Pixel "Fingerprint Gestures" is only available to its users that is why Nexus owners are disappointed. However, Google announced that it is looking for a solution to solve the issue. (Photo: Photo: Geekyranjit/YouTube) Perhaps, one of the best features that the Google Pixel has to offer is its ability to toggle the notification panel by swiping on the fingerprint sensor. When it was announced that such feature will only be exclusive to Pixel, some Nexus owners were dismayed. Advertisement As a response, Google said that they will look into it. SuperThomasLab is the App developer of the "Fingerprint Gestures" app and it aims to find a workaround for this problem. In fact, the "Fingerprint Gestures" app does exactly the same thing as the native feature found in Google Pixel. "Fingerprint Gestures" allows a user to configure the tap, the double-tap or the swipe on the fingerprint reader of your device to let you perform various functions. There are many supported actions such as open or toggle the notification panel, open quick settings, control media, open an app and many more. Users can also perform more actions such as activating and scrolling sleep mode, but this function requires that you have a rooted device. For an Android Nougat user, then you can use "Fingerprint Gestures" to toggle the split screen mode using any gestures, this time without root access. According to Android Police, the "Fingerprint Gestures" application needs Android 6.0 Marshmallow and most importantly, a device that has a fingerprint scanner. According to a report in Trusted Reviews, the new Pixel and Pixel XL have fingerprint scanners which allow the notification shade to be brought up only by swiping it, but within Android. It further reported that the feature is a part of the Android 7.1 update and sad to say, this application has not been implemented on Nexus 5X and 6P. As what have been mentioned, Google is already evaluating an update for the firmware but there are no confirmations whether or not the last generation handsets will obtain the update. Advertisement The firm did not disclose more details about their plans but they are still considering the feedback of its users. Google said that users should stay tuned for the update.   TagsAndroid, Pixel, Pixel Xl, nexus, Android 7.1, Fingerprint Gestures, Google You May Like These 2016 Newest Flagship Google Pixel C 10.2-in HD Touchscreen Tablet 64GB Premium High Performance | NVIDIA Tegra X1 with Maxwell GPU | 3GB RAM | Android 6.0 Marshmallow | Silver - Aluminum $730.00 More offers Shop Now PIXEL Phone by Google - 128GB - 5" inch - Android Nougat - Factory Unlocked 4G/LTE Smartphone (Quite Black) - International Version with No Warranty $1,059.00 More offers Shop Now Alytimes White Wireless Mega Pixel Pan Tilt IPCAM WiFi Home Security Network Cameras with IR-Cut,iPhone / Android View, Onvif, 128G SD Card Slot,Two Way Audio,Motion Detection $36.88 More offers Shop Now Sports Bluetooth Headset, Enegg Wireless stereo Earbud Headphone with Hands-free Calls for iPhone iPod iPad, Samsung, LG, Motorola, Neuxs, Google Pixel, Android Cell Phone/ Tablet, MP3/ MP4 Player $19.99 More offers Shop Now Related Articles 'HTC 10' Latest News & Update: Android 7.0 Nougat Update Will Be Available Soon?

The startup teased a second location was coming, which popped up today in Big Sur, near Loma Vista, California. The glasses come in three colors — black, coral, or teal — and are designed to capture photo and 10 seconds of video for the social media platform, costing around $130 a pair. Google’s wearable imager has fallen by the wayside, but Snapchat’s Spectacles have some good things going for them. For starters, they resemble snazzy sunglasses, a feature that the company hopes will attract its largest user base: millennials. Currently, the bright-yellow Snapbots are the only place to buy the glasses and just like the platform they run on, these happy little dispensers are only around for 24 hours. If you can’t make it out to Big Sur, and can’t wait until your neighborhood Snapbot opens, you might find some on eBay, presumably for a much higher price. A quick visit to their homepage will show you the all the Snapbots that are currently active. Hopefully soon, the map will be full of the minion-esque spectacle-dispensing boxes. Snapchat's newest Snapbot will be in Big Sur, California.  Once the bot’s location was revealed, people from all over the state were considering trekking to the Loma Vista area to secure their own pair of spiffy specs. @Spectacles 2 hour road trip let's goo!!! we comin for you specs 😎🐶 NO RAGRETS pic.twitter.com/qEL1VHg43B— teague loughman (@teagadinho) November 13, 2016 Others were hoping the happy, yellow boxes would soon come to their areas, and some even signed up for Twitter just to find out where the bot is.

Yes. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon all suffered this week, but some think that’s short-sighted. by Kara Swisher@karaswisher Nov 13, 2016, 3:46pm EST tweet share Linkedin Is the new U.S. president bad for Silicon Valley’s business? Carsten Koall / Getty Images There’s no question that stock of tech companies got hit this week on no real financial developments or performance issues. Except, of course, the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. Yes, that. Apple shares were down in the five days from $110.03 to about $108.43. Google was down from $795 to $771.56; Facebook dropped from $123.21 to $119.04; Netflix dropped from $124.26 to $114.78; and Amazon was off from $771.60 to $739.01. Most Wall Street analysts pointed to the Trump win as the proximate cause of the drop, given his rocky history with tech and also Silicon Valley so far. That’s included: A call for a boycott of Apple due to its encryption fight with the government and also his contention that it should make its devices in the U.S.; an attack on Amazon over taxes and, really, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos’s ownership of the tough-on-Trump Washington Post; and opposition to net neutrality regulations by the FCC, which have favored the internet powerhouses, and the possibility of their repeal. Add to that a hard line on immigration, as well as potentially isolationist trade policies and a myriad of tangles over tech-favored social issues like gay rights. And, most of all, just a fundamental disconnect between the new administration and Silicon Valley, which largely supported Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Of course there’s Peter Thiel, so Facebook (where he is a director) might be safe, along with Airbnb, Palantir, SoFi and other investments he has made in a myriad of tech startups. But most in Silicon Valley have no direct lines into the Trump administration, aside from tweeting congratulatory pleasantries at it in the vain hope of detente, so it will be a rough road for a while until the expected lobbying compromises are made in D.C. over the next year. And that is precisely what will happen. For all its vaunted liberal ideals of tolerance and meritocracy, tech is big business and it will find a way to live and thrive inside a Trump regime and make all the necessary compromises. There’s some good things they can get, too — all kinds of goodies for the rich, deregulation of the kind that benefits tech around employment, perhaps, and more. And a more business-friendly and free-spending administration, which will largely benefit banking, defense and infrastructure companies initially, will most certainly trickle down to tech in ways that might not seem clear right now. But government aid, obviously, is not the way that tech has thrived for so long. While it has used all the levers, most of Silicon Valley has been successful through creating innovative products and services that consumers and businesses use enthusiastically. Those that have not innovated have gotten dinged and those that have are doing well. That’s why the current stock sell-off is a short-term panic, rather than a real worry. Is it really likely that Trump will target Amazon relentlessly until it is in ruins? It makes for a compelling media story and Trump holds a grudge, but seems unlikely that this is what he wants to spend his time doing as president. As long as the company continues to improve its business in the ways that Wall Street likes, that will be all that matters, and any vindictive attacks on it by Trump will look bad for him and not Amazon. What investors will need to pay attention to is the overall market — it’s the economy, stupid, and as usual — and how issues with other countries like China and Europe develop. While there will be pressure to make more tech goods in this country, it’d be a small price to pay. They may feel bad on social media and wring their hands at the fresh daily horrors, but I predict total normalization by those in tech, who can pretzel with the best of them. And then it’s back to business as usual and the tech stocks will rise and fall based on that. recode_divider In this Storystream Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: Presidential election 2016 Donald Trump says his tweeting as president will be ‘very restrained,’ even as he trolls the New York Times today Should you ignore the Trump dump of tech stocks?

The latest product to be unveiled by tech giant Google was not a new smartphone or wearable device or search feature designed to be used by millions of everyday consumers. Rather, it was a US$6000 whiteboard designed to be used in your office conference room. The release of Jamboard puts the Silicon Valley behemoth into the niche but increasingly competitive market of interactive whiteboards, the high-tech equivalent of those dry-erase boards that employees use to scrawl out diagrams, lead presentations or brainstorm new ideas. Microsoft and Google have both got into the interactive whiteboard market this year, creating new competition for the largest and most entrenched player, Smart Technologies, a Canadian firm recently acquired by Foxconn. "The last piece of equipment in the office and classroom that hasn't made it into the modern age is the whiteboard," said Smart Technologies chief technology officer Warren Barkley. "We, along with Microsoft and Google, see this as an opportunity to move that static, physically isolated content into the wider world." Though commonplace today, the standard whiteboard is an innovation itself. Popularised in the late 1980s and 1990s, the whiteboard has, in many instances, replaced the dusty blackboard that always left hands, clothes and floors coated in a thin layer of chalk residue. Google As with a whiteboard, employees can post their ideas, documents and images on the Jamboard, only they won't need markers, tape or sticky notes to do it. The digital whiteboard is a more modern invention and it continues to evolve. Smart Technologies takes credit for creating the first interactive whiteboard in 1991. Barkley said those devices were primarily large display devices that used projectors and had maybe one or two touch points. Today, interactive whiteboards come with high-tech LED touch screens whose ease of use more closely resembles a tablet computer. That evolution has come with fits and starts, he said, and new arrivals could advance it further. Google's Jamboard is a 55-inch, touch screen monitor that connects to the cloud and taps into Google's G Suite of productivity apps, including Google Drive, Docs and Calendar. Equipped with machine learning technology, the board is marketed as a tool for companies to make information gathering and brainstorming more seamless. It's unclear whether Jamboard will have a meaningful impact on Google's income. It strikes a different tone from the company's other products, which are generally lower cost and marketed to the masses, because the electronic whiteboard is distinctly aimed at a business crowd with a hefty IT budget. Ad Feedback Google also faces stiff competition in the workplace technology market, said Vanessa Thompson, a research analyst at IDC, a market research firm specialising in technology. In March, Microsoft began shipping its own interactive whiteboard, called Surface Hub. Much as Jamboard integrates with Google's other products, Surface Hub integrates with Microsoft's established slate of workplace software, including Skype and Microsoft Office. The 55-inch Surface Hub sells for US$8999, and the 84-inch version goes for US$21,999. "At the very highest level, I would say almost every company today is going through some form of digital transformation," said Julia Atalla, senior director of Microsoft's Windows and Devices group. "Medium- to large-size businesses, they're looking at ways they can innovate faster." Interactive whiteboard purveyors say their products meet that need. Collaboration has become harder in office environments where some employees work remotely or travel often, and information is increasingly stored in digital formats and shared through email. Having a digital interface that all workers in a meeting can connect with to share information, video conference and otherwise engage makes those gatherings more productive, they say. But IT trends could also make the large capital investment needed to purchase the boards harder to justify, Thompson of IDC said. "There are some macro trends impacting the way we work, like decentralisation in large organisations, small team-oriented work, personal productivity tools augmenting tools provided by organisations," Thompson said. "These behavioral themes mean that workers are just as likely to use personal tools to share and collaborate as they are a space in the office."  - The Washington Post Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: BlackBerry's keyboard is coming back for one last dance Technology Homepage technology headlines Twitter to thwart cyber-bullying Live: 7.5 New Zealand quake Sleeping woman burnt by iPhone PS4 Pro: Hands on review An optimist on the future of energy Consumer drone market slumps Review: Watch Dogs 2 Where did you go Kendall?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung sets their Eyes on a Revolutionary Holographic TV | Main | Chinese State Publication Warns President Elect Trump that any Tariffs on Chinese Goods Would be bad News for Apple » November 13, 2016 Microsoft, Apple and Google Aim to Extend Touch Technologies to a World of new Devices and Applications   This week the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Microsoft about a new embedded sensor system that will allow touch controls to extend beyond traditional devices like a notebook touchpad through to clothing, in-home appliances, vehicle dashboards and steering wheels, a future Xbox controller, HoloLens and beyond. While Microsoft is working to make this happen in the not too-distant-future, Google is also working on bringing this technology to smart garments, according to a recent patent filing. Apple, on the other hand, has already brought embedded touch controls to their Magic Mouse and new Apple TV remote with Siri and has been working on this since 2007. But with patents from Google and Microsoft now coming to light, it's a sure thing that the race is now on to bring touch controls to a universe of new devices in the coming years. Today's report covers Microsoft's latest patent revelations along with highlights from Apple products and patents to demonstrate that Apple has been ahead of the curve on this front for many years.   Overview   Microsoft notes in their patent filing that designers of devices are continually looking to improve the accuracy and efficiency of touch, gestural, and other input mechanisms supported by devices to make it easier for users to interact with device, and thereby increase the popularity and utility of the devices. Traditionally, sensor systems utilize rigid components, such as printed circuit boards (PCBs), which makes it difficult to shape the sensors and/or include sensors in flexible or irregularly shaped objects and surfaces. Thus, the rigidity of traditional sensor systems limits the ways in which the sensors may be employed and the kinds of devices that can make use of the sensor systems. Microsoft's latest invention is to overcome these shortcomings so as to allow a new generation of devices to include touch and gestural controls. .   Introducing Embroidered Touch Sensor Systems   Microsoft's invention relates to embroidered sensor assemblies. In one or more implementations, the embroidered sensor assembly is formed on a flexible substrate, such as a suitable fabric material. Conductive patterns are sewn or stitched into the flexible substrate using embroidery techniques to form an array of sensors that can be configured in various ways and used in many different applications.   In Microsoft's patent FIG. 1 we're able to see an example of an embroidered sensor assembly. In particular, a sensor assembly #102 is represented as a flexible substrate #104 and an arrangement of embroidered sensors #106 that are embroidered (e.g., stitched or sewn) into the flexible substrate, In this example, the embroidered sensors are depicted as being arranged as a generally rectangular grid or array of conductive wires or threads in rows and columns.   The conductive wires may be configured as thin strands of metal such a copper or using another conductive material. The wires may have a diameter in range of about thirty to one hundred microns. Even larger diameter sizes up to several millimeters (e.g., approximately 2 mm to 5 mm) may also be used depending up the end use scenario. The conductive wires form intersections (e.g., nodes and/or electrodes) that correspond to positions of individual sensing points.   Although a rectangular grid arrangement is depicted, other patterns are also contemplated such as, by way of example and not limitation, hexagonal arrangements, concentric circles, a spiral arrangement, parallel lines, horizontal rows, vertical columns, individual points, and irregular arrangements.   The flexible substrate is representative of a flexible base material that is suitable for embroidering of the embroidered sensors. By way of example and not limitation, the flexible substrate may be configured using various fabric materials. The fabric materials can include woven and non-woven textiles as well as synthetic and natural fabrics. Flexible plastic and polymers substrates are also contemplated.   The sensor assembly can be configured to implement various kinds of sensors and sensing such as proximity, motion, flow direction and rates, gestures, and/or strain, to name a few examples.   Sensors may be arranged to measure mutual capacitance or self-capacitance. The sensor assembly can also implement conductive nodes configured to enable pressure and/or force sensitive controls for an input device, such as a keyboard, trackpad, mouse, etc. Something that Apple has already accomplished and implemented with their Magic Mouse as noted below.   In one of Apple's continuation patents published this week by the U.S. Patent Office Apple notes that a future head mounted display system would utilize a touch sensor on the exterior of the headset that would allow users to control content and audio volume. As with the Magic Mouse, the controls will simply be present on the device to accept gestures or motions to initiate them yet not be seen to clutter the interface of the device.     Possible Applications for Embroidered Sensors   As Microsoft notes in patent FIG. 2 below, their invention could be implemented in a wide range of future products including flexible displays, the HoloLens, Surface devices (tablets, notebooks, desktop), Xbox, a smartphone, a smartwatch, a smartband, a helmet, sporting equipment such as balls, a tennis racquet, a ring, an article of clothing, a glove, protective gear, sports pads, and a bracelet, to name but a few examples.   Another area where embroidered sensors will come to market will support the smart home, our vehicles and beyond. Microsoft notes that an embroidered sensor assembly can be embedded in, attached to, or otherwise associated with various different kinds of smart objects including furniture, appliances, industrial equipment, and other manufactured goods. Examples of smart objects could include devices including pipe and other objects such as lamps, doors, locks, molded plastic devices, products for automobiles or aircraft, a lounge chair, a coffee maker and more.   By way of example and not limitation, the embedding process #602 noted in patent FIG. 6 above, may involve surrounding an arrangement of a sensor assembly with a thermosetting resin and curing the thermosetting resin by applied heat or radiation to form the rigid structure #604. In another example, the embedding process involves arranging the sensor assembly in a mold and then melting a thermoplastic polymer and press molding or injection molding the thermoplastic polymer to surround the sensor assembly and form the rigid structure.   While Apple has never called their invisible sensors for the Magic Mouse 'embroidered sensors' they nonetheless have delivered on such sensors and plan to expand on this as noted with their future headset. Apple may also bring touch sensors to future Apple Watch smartbands (one and two) that could include motion sensors as Microsoft's patent has noted.    In 2014 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Could Apple be Eying Smart Clothing as the Next Big Thing?" Certain Apple patents and specific hires from the fashion world along with their involvement with the Met Museum's 2016 Fashion Exhibit on Fashion in an Age of Technology is teasing us into thinking tht Apple may be thinking of fashion beyond the Apple Watch. Apple could have hired many people to run the Apple Store operations but purposely chose to hire Angela Ahrendts who was CEO of Burberry a high-end fashion company. Beyond money, why would a successful CEO in fashion want anything to do with a restrictive computer company? Is it just coincidence or does Apple have a bigger vision for fashion and technology?   Digging back even further, I was able to find a 2007 Apple patent filing that was published in 2012 covering technology along this same front. Patently Apple's report covering this patent was titled "Apple Wins Next Generation Multi-Touch Skin Technology." The patent forecasted bringing touch sensors to objects like an in-home or in-office globe, vehicle steering wheels and a remote control. Is that not what the new Apple TV remote with Siri offers? Yes, of course and Apple has been working on that for years ahead of Microsoft and others.   Of course Google has now woken up to this next wave of sensors and filed a patent that we covered just last month titled "Google invents a Touch Gesture System Designed Specifically for Future Smart Garments."     In the end, it would appear that Apple is well ahead of the completion on sensors beneath device surfaces, though they've yet to advance into the world of fashion. Microsoft clearly wants to quickly move into this area of technology as noted in this week's patent revelations. They could easily begin by incorporating their embroidered sensor system into future versions of their Xbox controller, HoloLens headset and Surface devices and move into other areas over time.   Whether you call it embroidered sensors or invisible sensors, the fact is that touch sensors are about to go beyond notebook touchpads and touch displays for smartphones and tablets and begin to enter the general device world for in-home devices, in-vehicle applications and eventually smart clothing over the next five years. The good news is that Apple has been way ahead of the curve in this area so it'll be interesting to see where they take this touch technology next.   Microsoft filed their patent application back in Q2 2015 which was published by USPTO this past week. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such products to market is unknown at this time.   A Note for Tech Sites covering our Report: We ask tech sites covering our report to kindly limit the use of our graphics to one image.

Based on this year’s theme ‘If I could teach anyone anything, it would be’, Anvita had submitted her doodle titled ‘Live in the present’, which won compliments. Anvita who loves to draw is a student of Vibgyor High School in Balewadi, Pune. Her mother Aparna Telang said, “Although Anvita is a regular 11-year-old, sometimes her answers are so philosophical that they flummox me. Sometimes I tell her what is happening in my office and her replies have been very mature and different from what you would expect from someone as young as her.” Anvita believes that the world is running at a faster pace due to which it is not able to enjoy  small and good things in nature and life. “That is what I have tried to show in my doodle. I try to live in the present and not worry too much about anything. That keeps me happy,” she said. An official statement from Google said, “Her creativity and vision towards developing ‘a better world and healthy lifestyle’ is well reflected through her colourful doodle where she has showcased how everyone should ‘enjoy every moment’ and appreciate the simple things around us and live stress-free.” Over 50 cities across the country send their entries, which were then assessed on artistic merit, creativity and theme communication as well as their distinctive and different approach to the Doodle. The Doodle represents greeneries, water, water life, balloons, making it a lovely animated picture. Source: TOI Share.

Facebook in particular, has suffered the brunt of the criticism for allowing stories filled with factual inaccuracies to flood pages and misinform the public. How much blame Facebook actually deserves will certainly remain a subject for debate. After all, humans may be largely to blame for sharing error-riddled, often conspiratorial nonsense. Not so for Google search which may be the single most important way people around the world gather information, have questions answered and are directed to websites. The “Google Algorithm” is a constantly evolving, jealously protected secret. Sure, Google offers benign tips on how to improve its omnipotent search results but the nuts and bolts of the methodology remain deeply under wraps. So it is with that background, that I share this anecdote of searching in Google today for “Final Vote Count 2016,” which I would assume is a fairly common search phrase in the past few days. After penning this piece on why the anachronostic electoral college needs to be abolished, I wanted to review the latest numbers and update my piece accordingly. The number one search result (for this and other related searches) in Google News was this story from a site called 70News which appears to just be an individual’s WordPress site. The headline on the angry, conservative site blared in all caps: “FINAL ELECTION 2016 NUMBERS: TRUMP WON BOTH POPULAR (62.9 M -62.2 M ) AND ELECTORAL COLLEGE.” Now, of course, I knew this couldn’t possibly be true because that would have meant that somehow the state of California, where many of the latest votes were still being tallied, had suddenly gone seriously red. To be clear, those numbers are not remotely accurate as shown here, here and here. Clinton has actually expanded her lead in the popular vote significantly (my piece has been updated accordingly). But if you were to rely on the number one search result on Google News, one would falsely believe that Trump was suddenly up by 700,000 votes “#PopularVote: #Trump: 62,972,226 #Clinton: 62,277,750” So from where did the numbers come? Alas, the author anticipated that question and was armed with this response as of today, November 13: “Update: Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts.” More specifically, it was from this guy’s Twitter page Michael from Twitter claimed to have the final numbers Final #Election2016 Results By Numbers:- #PopularVote #electoralvotes pic.twitter.com/uKZevQvPfK — Michael (@Koxinga8) November 12, 2016 And the website 70News which shows up at the top of Google News search used “Michael” as its source. When Michael was challenged on Twitter about the source of his assertion, he linked to some nonsense about how absentee ballots are counted @4jmclemons Read here….. Why HILLARY Did Not Win The Popular Vote? pic.twitter.com/2wedTgLhwF — Michael (@Koxinga8) November 13, 2016 When pushed for more information on the source to which he linked Michael responded: @BBfan4life4sure That was a screen shot from news report which I forgot D link. Still some absentee votes which r traditionally 70% 4 RNC — Michael (@Koxinga8) November 13, 2016 Wow. While Michael can and will share whatever factually erroneous material he so chooses, the fact that Google, which typically is pretty good at sorting the news wheat from chaff, is promoting this site that uses Michael from Twitter as its source is a real issue. 70News went on to explain why it is the only site with the ‘real numbers.” “Knowing the Democrat media have been dragging their liberal feet giving Michigan to Trump – finally they did, with Arizona finally declared two days ago – Trump now has the 309. Except for the twitter posts, the popular vote number still need to be updated in Wikipedia or MSM media – which may take another few days because the liberals are still reeling and recovering from Trump-shock victory. If I’m wrong, I won’t hesitate to change the numbers. It’s the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it’s out there already.” The “establishment media” have, and will continue to do so (see links above for a few). But he/she doesn’t want to hear that and instead wants to rely on Michael’s Twitter feed. Furthermore, he/she is apparently waiting for the numbers to be updated on Wikipedia which, of course, gets its information from users citing the mainstream media since it does no actual reporting. We are entering a zone where even the hardest of facts become debatable​ in the minds of conspiracy theorists. But Google, you are effectively a computer program with none of that supposed media bias, so Google programmers please do what you can to stop helping them spread lies. It only enhances our increasing distrust in all forms of media. Most important, it’s really, really bad for the truth and for America. — — This is an opinion piece.

It started after a new UI was shown off in a support video for the Pixel, then users began seeing that update rolled out to more devices across the world. Now, Google is bringing their favorite “Cards” UI to the Play Store. A few users have started reporting seeing this change within the Play Store when searching for apps. Once the search has been completed, you will see a card that will show you the rating, number of installs, and two buttons for “More Info” and “Install”.

However, we have yet to see the update roll out to our devices here at Phandroid. If the update has appeared on your device, give us a heads up by leaving us a screenshot in the comments below.

By Matthew DeCarlo on Nov 13, 2016, 12:00 PM TechSpot The GTX 1080 Ti may have 10GB of VRAM Nvidia's GTX Titan class GPUs always come with huge price tags and the Pascal GTX Titan X is no different, costing $1200 in the US. GTX Titan series GPUs have never been about value for money, but they have always resulted in lower end GTX variants like the GTX 780Ti or GTX 980Ti that provide gamers with relatively good value for money. Ever since the GTX Titan X launched the big question on consumers lips was "where is the GTX 1080Ti", knowing that a more affordable variant is in the works. Now, a Nvidia GPU that is thought to be the GTX 1080 Ti has been found in an Indian shipping manifest... OC3D Intel may add Wi-Fi, USB 3.1 to next-generation chipsets Motherboard chipsets haven’t really changed much in the last few years. There’s been some support for new storage options and standards, like M.2 for SSDs, some limited support for features like Thunderbolt, and faster memory speeds have trickled out over time. Intel might shake things up a bit for its 300-series chipsets in 2017, if rumors are to be believed, with integrated support for Wi-Fi and USB 3.1.

Facebook Google Pixel pwned in 60 seconds Power of Community The Google Pixel fell to a team of Chinese hackers alongside Apple Safari and Adobe Flash at the PwnFest hacking competition in Seoul on Friday. Mountain View's latest offering was smashed by white-hat friendlies from Qihoo 360, who used an undisclosed vulnerability to gain remote code execution for $120,000 cash prize. The exploit launched the Google Play store before opening Chrome and displaying a web page reading "Pwned By 360 Alpha Team". The Register Quick, how might the alien spacecraft work?

Robot solves rubik's cube in less than a second Solving a Rubik's Cube is an impressive feat by itself, but now, a robot can do it in record time, cracking the 3D puzzle about 10 times faster than the human who holds the world record. In just over half of a second (0.637 seconds), the Sub1 Reloaded robot made each side of the Rubik's Cube show a single color. This breaks the previous record of 0.887 seconds achieved by an earlier version of the same machine using a different processor. Live Science Apple said to release curved, bezel-free 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhones next year Apple will release new 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhones with curved, bezel-free designs next year, according to Barclays Research analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang. The analysts, citing sources within Apple's supply chain following a trip to Asia this week, said the borderless design will allow for the new iPhones to be the same overall size as current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models. MacRumors DIY coprocessors for the Game Boy Color Back in the olden days, when video games still came on cartridges, the engineers and programmers making these carts had a lot of options. One of the most inventive, brilliant, and interesting cartridges to come out of the 90s was Star Fox for the Super Nintendo. Star Fox featured a coprocessor chip, the Super FX, that was effectively a GPU used to draw polygons in the frame buffer. Hackaday Video games are boring Video games are bigger than movies. Everyone's a gamer. I've devoted my life-no exaggeration-to video games for 14 years, working on titles such as Company of Heroes, a few Assassin's Creeds, and Child of Light. But everywhere I go, I meet people who don't like video games. Most of my friends don't like video games. And one of my favourite things when I'm meeting a new person is to watch them squirm, to struggle to relate, after I mention I work in the video game industry. Games Industry Artificial-intelligence system surfs web to improve its performance Of the vast wealth of information unlocked by the Internet, most is plain text. The data necessary to answer myriad questions -- about, say, the correlations between the industrial use of certain chemicals and incidents of disease, or between patterns of news coverage and voter-poll results — may all be online. But extracting it from plain text and organizing it for quantitative analysis may be prohibitively time consuming. MIT LipNet: How easy do you think lipreading is? Lipreading is the task of decoding text from the movement of a speaker's mouth. Traditional approaches separated the problem into two stages: designing or learning visual features, and prediction. More recent deep lipreading approaches are end-to-end trainable (Wand et al., 2016; Chung & Zisserman, 2016a). All existing works, however, perform only word classification, not sentence-level sequence prediction. Yannis Assael Reasons not to use Uber We should not accept the promotional term "sharing economy" for companies like Uber. That is spin. A more accurate term is "piecework subcontractor economy".

(WTHI) – I need to get this out of the way up front…there will be a lot of comparisons between the Google Pixel XL and the iPhone 7 Plus. I hate comparing phones…but sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do. So, let’s talk Pixel. This is Google’s newest phone. You can get it in the 5-inch version…or the Pixel XL in the 5.5-inch version. For this review, Verizon hooked me up with the XL. At this point, I’ve reviewed a ton of Android-based phones…some super gimmicky…some really nice ones. The Pixel XL falls into the really nice category. No gimmicks on this guy. When you hold the XL, it is heavy. Not…oh my goodness…this will wear my arm out heavy…think…this feels good…it feels sturdy heavy. Some Android phones feel really flimsy. This phone doesn’t. And oh my wow…that screen is beautiful. The 5.5-inch screen is just nice to look at. So nice. I could give you the pixel to size ratio…and you may know what it means…but it really doesn’t matter. It is one of the more beautiful screens I’ve looked at. Now, to the form factor. This is where the iPhone comparisons come in. There is no other way to put this…it looks like an iPhone. In fact, when on of our reporters took a look at it, he paraded it around the newsroom, successfully making people believe it was his new iPhone. It has the antenna lines, the brushed aluminum. The curved edges. The same type of bezel. Now…let me be clear. That isn’t a bad thing. I always have loved the iPhone design. With all of that said, there is one big…big…difference. The fingerprint sensor is in a different spot. The back of the phone. Bam dum dum. I hate when the fingerprint sensor is on the back of the phone. I feel like I am always struggling with it. To it’s credit, though…it is super quick. It feels like it reads fingerprints better than my iPhone. While the new iPhone is without a headphone port, the Pixel XL has one. There weren’t any headphones included with the phone, however. So the question, though…what this all boils down to, how is this different from the mass amounts of other Android phones on the market? There are two big ways. This phone is actually made by Google.

Why does it matter that this phone is actually made by Google? It will get the best support from the company that creates Android. That means (for the next couple of years at least) you’ll be the first to get updates. The Android updates will be made with your phone in mind. There is something huge to be said for that. Another thing that sets it apart is Google’s Siri competitor, Assistant. To be blunt…as a lifelong Apple user, I am super impressed by Google Assistant. “Ok, Google.” Those two words are all you need to bring her up. Just like Siri, you can ask Assistant to do basic things….like calling friends or family…and of course doing Google searches. To me, Assistant seems a little bit more organic than Siri. Now, how about the camera? I took the Pixel XL toe to toe with an iPhon 7 Plus for a photo I can’t say either one would be a decisive winner. Don’t get me wrong, they are both great…but great in their own ways. If you are taking a basic photo, no zoom, nothing fancy, with the Pixel…it’s better than the iPhone.

There is 12-megapixel rear camera and an 8-megapixel front facing camera. On the software side, it moves quick, probably quicker than any Android phone I’ve reviewed…but not quite as quick as my iPhone. It’s not anything you’ll notice, though. The big difference comes in app reloading. Meaning if you close an app…and reopen it, you’ll get a little load time. If Google wants to bad enough, that is something that could be fixed in a software update. So, what’s the bottom line? If you hate iOS and everything Apple stands for…but love the design and streamline that comes with controlling both the hardware and software…this phone is for you. It doesn’t do anything gimmicky…it doesn’t raise the bar in any huge way. But that’s a good thing. It’s a slick phone, with a great design…that I really feel like will be supported for years to come. If you want to check the Pixel or the Pixel XL out, it’s a Verizon exclusive. You can learn more at this link.

Five Great Calendar App Alternatives for Android GO Some interesting alternatives to Google's Calendar app Nov 13, 2016 17:45 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  For many Android users, Google Calendar is a reliable application, but if for some reason you're not among them, we've put together a list of solid alternatives that you can definitely try out. All these Calendar apps are free to download, but some of them have premium features that can't be accessed unless you pay real money. We'll mention in the description of each of these apps whenever some of the features are “hidden” under a paywall. Simple Calendar Let's start with a simple yet solid app, Simple Calendar. If you're looking for a simple offline calendar, then this should be your choice. It doesn't feature other calendar integration, but you can create recurring events and set up reminders. In addition, Simple Calendar shows week numbers in case you absolutely need this feature. The app comes with a nice little widget (4x4) that's resizable. You can even customize the color of the text and background. Simple Calendar is completely free and does not contain ads. It comes with a Dark theme too and, as devs put it, it doesn't come with “unnecessary permissions.” Simple Calendar for Android Business Calendar 2 Next in line, we've picked a more complex calendar app that should suit everyone's needs. It's called Business Calendar 2 and is the sequel to a very popular calendar app called … Business Calendar. It comes with a wide array of features including event planner and task management, support for local calendars and tasks, advanced event reminders, birthdays of contacts, year view, and agenda with live search. However, keep in mind that Business Calendar 2 app uses Android calendar sync which allows synchronization with Google Calendar and Exchange services. Other highlights of the app include month, week, day, agenda, icon and tasks widget. Business Calendar 2 features integrated task organizer which syncs with Google Tasks, as well as customizable notifications with direct actions. It also has more than 600 emoticons that you can use for your events. The application is free and doesn't contain ads, but some Pro features are available after you pay for the premium version, such as integrated weather report in day view, ability to link contacts to appointments, advanced options for reminders, extended task features, and many more. Business Calendar 2 for Android BlackBerry Calendar Most of you probably already know about BlackBerry Calendar, but if you haven't yet used the application then you really should. The application works on any Android device regardless if it's a BlackBerry or not. However, those who don't have a BlackBerry device can use the application free for 30 days, but after that the app will start displaying ads. To remove the ads, you must subscribe to BlackBerry Hub+ from within the Calendar app. BlackBerry Calendar functions within the BlackBerry Hub+, so you'll have to install both apps for better functionality. It allows you to respond to meeting invitations directly from BlackBerry Hub and it syncs with work accounts, as well as personal ones. BlackBerry Calendar also syncs with Google Calendar, Outlook, and Microsoft Exchange calendars and fully supports Android for Work. BlackBerry Calendar for Android Work Shift Calendar Furthermore, we've chosen a great calendar application for those who work in shifts. It's called Work Shift Calendar and it's been especially designed for shift workers and those who need to keep order in their day to not miss any appointments. It allows you to easily create as many shifts as you want and configure them visually, set alarms and include various actions at the start or end of each shift (turn on/off, switch to sound/vibration/silence mode). Work Shift Calendar also allows users to create notes each day and add reminders with alarms, so they don't forget any important appointments or important notes. One other thing that we'd like to mention is the ability to create a widget for your phone's desktop, which will allow you to display your calendar without having to open the application. Work Shift Calendar for Android Wallet Calendar Wallet Calendar is a bit of an unusual app in the fact that it does not sync with any other calendars. Also, it's not a wallet or a day planner, but the concept is “based on the card calendar that a business provides which fits into the wallet.” It comes with all the standard features that a calendar app includes, but it displays them in a clean and nice manner. Wallet Calendar allows you to enable or disable various calendar views: twelve months, six months, three months, or one month. The app features holiday listing for the selected country (there's a list of supported countries) and it allows you to add specific dates for special events to the calendar. You can then edit or delete these special events whenever you want. You can also have multiple profiles in Wallet Calendar, but the app also comes with the option to customize colors and highlights for special dates. Wallet Calendar for Android Simple Calendar, Business Calendar 2, BlackBerry Calendar, Work Shift Calendar, and Wallet Calendar are our picks as great Google Calendar alternatives. Obviously, there are many other calendar apps in Google Play store that might better suit your needs. These five apps that we've recommended are just a selection, and if you're in need of a calendar app, you can give them a try.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (6 Images) #Simple Calendar#Business Calendar 2#Work Shift Calendar#BlackBerry Calendar#Wallet Calendar subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (6 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Assistant Channel Available on IFTTT for Android Facebook Releases Events App on iOS, Android Version to Come Soon Google Docs, Sheets and Slides Get Updated with Retrieve Trashed Files Feature Google Maps Version 9.38 Brings Upcoming Events Tab Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money WhatsApp Announces Video Calling Rolling Out to Android, iOS Users Microsoft Announces Black Friday 2016 Deals: Perfect Time to Go Windows 10 KDE Frameworks 5.28.0 Released with Numerous KWayland Improvements, More NVIDIA Makes Available GeForce Graphics Driver 375.86 - Get It Now Microsoft CEO Meets Chinese Official One Day After Warning on Trump Tax Plan Apple Downplays Microsoft Surface, Says Having Touch on a Desktop Is a Disaster 6 photos    Android calendar apps New Android APKs Ingress APK: Updated November 15th, 14:19 GMT Facebook Messenger APK: Updated November 15th, 14:16 GMT Inbox by Gmail APK: Updated November 15th, 14:10 GMT Box APK: Updated November 15th, 14:05 GMT Microsoft Hyperlapse Mobile APK: Updated November 15th, 13:59 GMT Xbox 360 SmartGlass APK: Updated November 15th, 13:53 GMT My Apps APK: Updated November 15th, 13:47 GMT Reader comments Pictures and Specs of Google's Canned Project ARA Smartphone Leaked Out more on: Project Ara i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

In addition to officially doing away with Nexus, the company has introduced the new Google Pixel and Pixel XL. These devices are launched and available for purchase through the Google Store and Google’s chosen carrier partner, Verizon Wireless. Let’s take a look at the specs: Android 7.1 OS 2.15 GHz Quad-Core Snapdragon processor 5″ display | 5.5″ display with quad HD resolution 8 MP front camera and 12.3 MP rear camera 4 GB RAM 32 GB or 128 GB options available 2,770 mAh battery | 3,450 mAh battery While the storage for these devices is not expandable, there is unlimited backup for photos and videos available, so long as the customer has a Google account. Both devices also come equipped with Google Assistant, a voice assistant, ready to be summoned with an “OK Google”. The batteries seem to be high quality, and Google boasts on its website that you can achieve 7 hours of battery within 15 minutes of power from the high-speed charger provided. These devices are ready for purchase and come in three colors: very silver, quite black, and really blue. Through the Google Store, the Pixel starts at $649 and the Pixel XL starts at $769. The 128 GB version of both go for $100 more, though the Pixel XL 128 GB is currently sold out. When purchased through the Google Store, these devices come unlocked and ready for activation on most carriers who accept bring-your-own-device. Google’s own Project Fi is offering free SIM cards with all Pixel and Pixel XL purchases. Logging In...

Hackers just infiltrated the Google Pixel phone in less than 60 seconds The Daily Dot 2 days ago Josh Katzowitz © Photo via Google google pixel Only a few weeks after the Google Pixel smartphone was released to the public, it still is not immune to hackers who want to infiltrate your device. That was proven true by a team of Chinese hackers in less than a minute at the PwnFest hacking competition on Friday.  A team of white-hat friendly hackers from Qihoo 360, an internet security company, accessed the Google Play store before opening a Chrome web page that read "Pwned By 360 Alpha Team." As Forbes reports, the hackers managed the deed in less than 60 seconds to win a $120,000 prize.  Adrian Ludwig, the director of Android security, told Motherboard earlier this month that the Pixar and the iPhone were about the same as far as security is concerned. Considering this is the second time the device has been infiltrated by white-hat hackers since its release that month, Pixel users could be forgiven for not necessarily believing that at this moment. Google said the bug found in Chrome was patched within a day of the hacking.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish ZTE Stock Android Smartphones Might Be A Possibility By Adnan Farooqui on 11/13/2016 08:25 PST Google may have killed the Nexus program but it appears that ZTE wants to carry the baton forward. To be fair, Google has ditched Nexus because it doesn’t fit in the “Made by Google” vision that it has got going with the Pixel handsets even though the new flagships offer the stock Android experience that people loved Nexus devices for. According to a report, ZTE is considering making stock Android smartphones which would provide an experience quite similar to what people have been used to with Nexus handsets. ZTE USA launched a community poll a couple of months ago asking users if they preferred to use Android devices that offered a stock or close to stock experience. Many users agreed that they like a stock experience and the company is now asking them why they prefer using unadulterated Android. According to a new report, ZTE now appears to be thinking about launching smartphones powered by stock Android. It would be the result of the company listening to what its fans want. ZTE has been very open to customer feedback these days so it might respond accordingly by launching smartphones that provide an almost Nexus-like experience. The community poll is still open where ZTE fans can express their views on why they prefer stock Android over customizations. It merits mentioning here that the company hasn’t confirmed anything about plans for a new smartphone at this point in time so it might be a while before we see Nexus-like devices from this company.

Anvita had submitted her doodle based on this year's theme'If I could teach anyone anything, it would be'. The doodle would be featured on the home page of Google India on November 14 to celebrate Children's Day. A student of Vibgyor High School in Balewadi, Anvita loves to draw. Her mother Aparna Telang said, "Although Anvita is a regular 11-year-old, sometimes her answers are so philosophical that they flummox me. Sometimes I tell her what is happening in my office and her replies have been very mature and different from what you would expect from someone as young as her." Anvita thinks that the world is going too fast and it needs to stop to enjoy the small and good things in nature and life. "That is what I have tried to show in my doodle. I try to live in the present and not worry too much about anything. That keeps me happy," she said. An official statement from Google said, "Her creativity and vision towards developing 'a better world and healthy lifestyle' is well reflected through her colourful doodle where she has showcased how everyone should 'enjoy every moment' and appreciate the simple things around us and live stress-free."

Hamilton must win and hope Rosberg finishes in fourth if he is to win his third successive world title. This could have been so different. Hamilton was struggling to see out of his visor at the beginning of the race today, and Rosberg somehow avoided a spin and crash on lap 46. But it’s nicely poised.

Live feed Show 10.32pm EST 22:32 Final thoughts That doesn’t leave us with a whole lot to say, except that Australia will resume bowling tomorrow in the same difficult position that they would have started in today. That is, 86 runs behind, needing another five South African wickets before knowing the scope of the task ahead. Best case, they can run through South Africa and face a recoverable deficit of around 100, then bat well enough to set a decent target. Worst case, Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma will push the lead out to 200 or more, and Australia will be knocked over once again for an innings defeat. These are very difficult times for a team that seems to be unprepared to play Test cricket in any kind of difficult batting conditions. I’ll leave you with Adam Collins’ piece from after play finished yesterday, which may be the only Guardian article to lead off with referencing the early 90s sketch show, Full Frontal. Geoff out, we’ll see you tomorrow on the OBO.

Whately wants to know if the scheduling and preparation was awry, with very little first-class cricket before the Tests. “The South Africans have had the same preparation that we’ve had,” counters Sutherland. “If you draw that comparison, the team that we’re playing against hasn’t had any different preparation.” So the difference is in the fundamental quality of the teams on the field. When asked if they had considered replacing Rod Marsh as chairman of selectors immediately after he announced he would retire next year, Sutherland says no, but is measured in his language to avoid hollowly saying that the selectors have been doing a great job. The pair also discuss whether Steve Smith needs more support as a young captain, whether Test cricket has enough support itself in balance with commerce, whether this is a crisis point that will bring drastic change or whether CA will try to hold things steady, whether Tasmania will keep getting Test cricket.

The Australians may well be enjoying a break from being humiliated on the field. Here’s a great little note from reader Ian Forth on the current situation. “Not sure if this helps but the ECB were in a similar situation to Australian cricket in 2001. Their solutions were wide ranging. 20/20, central contracts, community engagement being the headlines (I did the qualitative research on their behalf).” “For a fusty crew the First Class Forum did “vote for change”. What they couldn’t fix was a lack of national success and hero personalities. Coincidentally or otherwise, however, the team improved and the likes of Flintoff and Pietersen provided fun role models for the kids.

It gets confusing.” He must have loved high school. The beloved Tasmanian Good Boy George Bailey is more conciliatory toward the mentor class. “It’s great, you get different information about how to do things.

McGrath c & b de Villiers (Australia all out 111) Calamity for Australia! The young rangy paceman gets off the mark with a glided single, but once back on strike he chips a defensive shot back to the bowler. Utterly hopeless, he’ll never make a Test fifty. Australia falls six runs short of what should have been a routine chase, in a game that will surely be replayed for years to come.

The different accents and accompanying stories and specialisms are what makes each commentary series interesting. Neil Manthorp is doing a sterling job on the ABC at the moment filling that niche. Channel 9 have woefully ignored this aspect for years, failing to provide any counterbalance to the cheerleading ex-players it employs.

The covers are seen over the pitch as rain falls on day two of the 2nd Test match between Australia and South Africa at Bellerive Oval in Hobart. Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.34pm EST 19:34 Chris Morris (not the satirist, or the South African allrounder) is the latest to distract me from contemplating the resemblance between Pat Symcox and Ray Illingworth... “Bugger of a day to be doing the OBO,” Chris correctly begins. “Really enjoyed yesterday’s pitch, had something for pace and spin, a rarity in test cricket. Made every over interesting to watch. The question I have is, is their any light at the end of the tunnel for Australia? There appears to be no obvious replacements in either bat or ball? Does Australia go for youth (like an AFL team rebuilding) or can that ruin a promising career by bringing talented but unproven players into the game too early?” This might take a while... As per Norman’s question below, I think context is everything. What are Australia trying to achieve? Presumably a glib ‘number one ranking in all formats’ can be trotted out, but is that alone enough? I would be setting targets around winning in India and England, and my team building approach would be with those goals in mind. Therefore, I’d be concerned less with raw numbers and more interested in technique and character. We know (usually) that Australian batsman can plunder runs in home conditions, but who are the ones that can do it when the situation is at its most unfavourable? Whether this is shuffling the pack a little, or wholesale change, depends on who’s available. I wouldn’t be afraid of making a raft of changes if the talent is available. Names that spring immediately to mind include Handscomb, Head, Bancroft and Maxwell, but there will be more. The challenge then is to communicate to the public that this is a project, and one that needs time. This will be a hard sell for a cricket community that knows only winning and now seems disengaged beyond the brief summer months. But, this is an opportunity to resolve another of the long-lamented issues in the game, the lack of characters. If these young colts are sold to us smartly, we’ll want to back them in and give them the benefit of the doubt, especially if they reveal the type of characteristics we’re looking for. Using the AFL analogy, look at how much goodwill the Western Bulldogs carried into this season’s premiership. It might fail, but this near-permanent state of transition the team’s been in since about 2005 doesn’t seem to be working. Oh, and keep the bowlers fit. An attack of Starc, Hazlewood, Cummins and Pattinson has the potential to be a decade-long attack of fearsome quality whatever the conditions. Also, this safety net with the ball should paper over some of the batting cracks.

The ICC has to do more to make a day’s play more continuous and action-packed. 90 overs is the minimum number of required overs to be bowled, not a mythical target to be staggering towards in twilight. Once that nettle has been grasped, more radical ideas like four-day Tests can be countenanced. I think day-night Tests are a no-brainer. It means the game will be accessible to spectators at venues and on TV at times when they’re best able to turn up and tune in. I sympathise with players in the transitional period while they’re effectively guinea pigs for ball lacquer, floodlights and so on, but not enough to delay the widespread introduction where possible. As for relevance, clearly there needs to be a periodic finish line somewhere along the way to give context and rivalry beyond the historic. The year-end mace doesn’t really seem to hit the mark, but I’m yet to be convinced of any alternative suggestions. However, I’m open minded about trialling them. But that is a largely moot debate anyway until the ICC gets to grips with the international game’s basic organisation and the reliance on India as a source of revenue.

Play will not start on time (10.30am local) and it’s unlikely there’ll be any play this morning. The forecast is bleak for this afternoon and evening too.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.02am EST 02:02 What we know so far A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit near Hanmer Springs in the north of South Island, New Zealand at 12.02am. Two people are confirmed dead. Several main roads and rail lines have been badly damaged and are impassable. Thousands of people were evacuated to high ground after a tsunami warning was issued. The warnings were lifted, but people remain advised to stay away from waterways due to strong waves and currents. Kaikoura, a town of about 2,000 people, in the South Island, has been almost completely isolated with roads closed and phone lines down. There is a state of emergency in place for the town. One thousand tourists will be airlifted out over the coming days, and a frigate is also en route to evacuate people. It could be two weeks until the roads reopen. John Key, the prime minister, toured the affected area and said the damage, which could cost the nation $2bn, was “horrendous”. There are severe weather warnings for the northern parts of South Island, which could hamper the response effort. The Clarence river dam has been breached, sending a wall of water downstream and threatening farms. Scientists think the quake might have actually been two quakes in separate faults. A strong 6.8-magnitude aftershock hit near Cheviot in the South Island. A 100-year-old woman has been pulled alive from the rubble of a collapsed homestead. Residents have been advised to boil drinking water in the town of Raglan after water supplies were affected by the quake.

Thiem knocks it well wide. But he’s pressing now, ripping into a vicious 103mph forehand to make it 30-all, earning his first break point when Djokovic flaps a weak backhand into the net. This is A Big Moment. A lengthy rally ensues. But Djokovic catches out Thiem with a deep forehand, the Austrian spooning his riposte into the crowd. Deuce. Djokovic survives the scare. He holds.

The level of this match isn’t that high, to be brutally honest, and an error from Djokovic makes it 40-0. Djokovic hangs in there, making it 40-15 with a lovely drop shot, but he gifts the game to Thiem when he somehow wallops an easy forehand wide with the Austrian at his mercy.

He’s got a plaster now, though, and he behaved so well that the trainer gave him a nice lollypop for being a brave boy. He’s recovered sufficiently to win the first point of this game. Thiem races through the next three, though, an ace making it 40-15, but Djokovic takes it to deuce and earns a break point when the Austrian duffs a drop volley at the net. Djokovic can’t take it, though, sending a backhand return long. Thiem eventually holds with an ace. But Djokovic is knocking on the door.

He drags Djokovic to the net and pounces on a weak volley, thrashing a forehand away for 0-15. Djokovic hits back with an ace. The next rally’s tough, neither man giving an inch - until Thiem incorrectly challenges a Djokovic backhand that just kissed the line. The games goes to 30-all, but Djokovic does well to keep Thiem at bay and holds to 30. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.21am EST 09:21 First set: Djokovic 1-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem is likely to need a strong start here to settle any lingering nerves. The first two points are shared; he bangs an ace down the middle for a 30-15 lead. He dominates the next rally, pushing Djokovic around the baseline, and finishing the point with a smash at the net for a 40-15 lead. Then he slaps two forehands into the net, though, allowing Djokovic back to deuce. A brilliant backhand winner down the line is enough for Thiem to hold, though.

Greg Rusedski takes on Guardian writer Jacob Steinberg at tennis Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.11am EST 08:11 The encouraging news for Novak Djokovic is that Dominic Thiem’s recent form is awful. He warmed up for this tournament with a second round defeat to Jack Sock in Paris and the truth is that he’s struggled ever since his early withdrawal from his fourth-round match against Juan Martin del Potro at the US Open. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.39am EST 06:39 Preamble Hello. If you’re capable of thinking back as far as 5 June 2016, you’ll be able to recall that the world back then was a ... different place. That’s putting it mildly. To delve into current affairs for a moment, thereby showing off the depth and wisdom that can be found on the Guardian sports desk, Brexit was still a few weeks away and Hillary Clinton was thinking about how she was going to decorate the Oval Office. Meanwhile Novak Djokovic had just thumped Andy Murray in the French Open, completing the career slam in the process, and he was looking good to dominate for the rest of the year. In summary, WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN?! There are no certainties any more. Forget everything you thought you knew. Leave your assumptions at the door. Djokovic is no longer the world No1, his long reign at the top brought to an end by Murray last weekend, and he has been in the grip of a physical and spiritual crisis ever since Roland Garros. He imploded against Sam Querrey at Wimbledon (Sam Querrey!), wept after losing in the first round of the Olympics, crumbled against Stan Wawrinka in the final of the US Open and has recently been seeking guidance from a spiritual guru. As much as Djokovic protests otherwise, all is not well in his world. He has lost to players he would barely have given a second glance to a few months ago and while respect remains, given that everyone knows that a fit and firing Djokovic is capable of, there is certainly less fear around at the moment. What an opportunity this is for young Dominic Thiem, who is making his debut in the ATP World Tour Finals after a fine year. The 23-year-old Austrian has risen to ninth in the rankings – Rafael Nadal’s injury opened up an extra spot – and he is becoming a fixture in the top 10. A potential future No1, Thiem has a 3-0 losing record against Djokovic and took seven games off the Serbian at Roland Garros, when he reached his first grand slam semi-final, but he will know that his opponent comes into this match weighed down by fitness problems, dented confidence and recent surprise defeats to Marin Cilic and Roberto Bautista Agut. He will be wary, though, conscious that he is about to take on a wounded Djokovic, a potentially dangerous Djokovic, a Djokovic who is looking for a fifth consecutive triumph in this tournament and wrestle the No1 spot back off Murray. The mission to resume normal service begins here. Play begins: around 2pm GMT.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.56am EST 09:56 Aaron Bower Half-time thoughts Here’s Aaron Bower, our man at the London Stadium: It’s a familiar scoreline for England fans with Australia leading at half-time – but it’s certainly not been a half without hope for Wayne Bennett’s side. But for five minutes before the break, England were much the better side: which makes the fact they trail by four points in a game they cannot afford to lose hard to swallow. The positives? England have certainly held their own against the world champions and deservedly led via Jermaine McGillvary’s try. But the failure to find touch from penalties not once, but twice, throughout the half, is something England can ill-afford more of. Against the Kangaroos, it’s the little things you do that matter so much. There’s still cause for hope, but it feels like England have given themselves some unncessary work to do.

(Associated Press files) By ANICK JESDANUN, Associated Press Published: November 13, 2016, 6:05 AM A   A Google’s new smart speaker is at once a secretary, a librarian and a radio. Ask about your day, and the Home speaker will give you the time, weather, estimated commute, the news and upcoming calendar appointments. It will convert miles into feet, and dollars into euros. Want to hear Adele or Coldplay? Home will fetch you some tunes. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Amazon has already been at it for about two years. Its Echo speaker can do what Home does and more, thanks to Amazon’s head start in partnering with third-party services such as Domino’s Pizza and Fitbit. But Home is smarter in a few other ways, as it taps what it knows about you from Gmail, Maps and other Google services. Home is also $50 cheaper, at about $130 (though Amazon offers a mini “Echo Dot” version for just $50). • AT YOUR COMMAND. Think of both Home and Echo as extensions of your iPhone or Android device. Sure, I can check weather on the phone, but why not just ask the speaker as I’m getting dressed? And no need to lift a finger to check the calendar. With guests over, I can resolve trivia disputes using voice searches and avoid screens. I was able to keep tabs on the Chicago Cubs’ quest to break a century-long World Series drought. Both devices work as alarm clocks or timers — great in the kitchen. Both can control lights, thermostats and other internet-connected appliances, though you need capable devices first. Of course, I have to get used to speaking aloud with no one around. Privacy is a concern, too, once I enable all the features. Anyone within hearing distance will know when I’m seeing the doctor or leaving my apartment empty for vacation. Home and Echo are continually listening for commands, though Google and Amazon say nothing gets passed back to them until the speakers hear a keyword — “OK, Google” for Home and “Alexa” for Echo. A light comes on to remind you that it’s listening. You can turn off the microphone temporarily, too. • LONGING FOR MORE. Neither device is all that proactive. Android phones with the Google Now assistant will remind me when it’s time to leave for work or the airport, based on estimated travel times. But I’m usually not checking the phone as I’m getting ready to leave. I could use a nudge from either speaker. On the other hand, I might find a stranger’s voice jarring when I think I’m alone. It’s a new technology, and companies still have to figure out the right balance. And while Home and Echo offer the basics, neither lets me dig deeper. Sure, I have an appointment at 11 a.m., but where is it and with whom? And how can I get there? It’s back to the phone. Another limitation: Both speakers are tied to a single account, so families won’t get individual calendars and preferences. • IN UNITY. The speakers are more powerful when they coordinate with your other devices. The best stab so far comes from Amazon. Ask Echo the weather, and the speaker will tell you current conditions and the day’s forecast. But if you have an Amazon Fire tablet nearby, you automatically get a full-screen display with the week’s forecast. Ask Echo about the Cubs, and you’ll hear the score. The tablet gives you inning-by-inning breakdowns. Home can control Google’s Chromecast streaming TV devices, but the preview I’ve been testing has been painful to use. You can pause, resume or forward video; you’re also supposed to be able to rewind and start from the beginning, but Home gets fussy. It currently works only with YouTube video (Netflix and Google Photos are coming soon). Even then, Home keeps thinking I’m requesting a song that doesn’t exist. There’s potential here, but controls on the phone are much easier. Watching TV shouldn’t take a lot of work. Ideally, the technology will just know where and how to present information and entertainment. In such a scenario, you can set one alarm, and Google or Amazon will find you wherever you are — whether it’s on the speaker at home, or a phone if you’re away. Or if you ask the speaker about a nearby restaurant, directions go to your phone. For now, unification is limited to a shopping list you can add to and view (or hear) from any device. • EARLY SMARTS, EARLY DUMBS. Home, with an early incarnation of a Google digital companion called Assistant, seems the smarter of the two out of the gate. It knows about my upcoming flight, based on reservations in Gmail. It offers commute times using transit, as Google already senses through my Android phone that I don’t drive to work. Home can also estimate driving time to just about any other destination. Echo sends me to work, even when I ask about Boston. And Home is alone in setting alarms more than 24 hours away. But partnerships will make these speakers more useful. I can ask Echo about my Fitbit goals or order pizza from Domino’s; I can’t with Home. Amazon has more than a thousand such partnerships, known as skills. Google’s integrations are initially limited to calling for Ubers, changing news or music providers and controlling smart devices from Phillips, SmartThings and Nest (a Google sister company). Google still has bugs to work out. How are the Chicago Cubs doing? Home told me the Cubs are the regular-season division leaders and are based in Chicago. Duh! I had to ask again for the World Series score. And after the Cubs won in extra innings early in the morning, both Home and Echo were nonchalant in giving me the final score. I wouldn’t have known from either that the Cubs were now the world champions and that Chicago fans got to finally celebrate.

 Here's why a Google Ventures investor believes talking to computers all the time is the future of tech Avery Hartmans Nov. 13, 2016, 9:00 AM 3,857 facebook linkedin twitter email print GV general partner M.G. Siegler. Google Ventures Not only is talking to voice-powered devices not weird, it's the only way we'll be computing in the near future.  That's according to GV's M.G. Siegler. Siegler — a general partner at Alphabet's early-stage venture arm, GV (formerly Google Ventures) — who says the use of artificial intelligence-powered devices like Amazon Echo and Google Assistant are a sign of where things are headed in the tech industry.  While most of us might feel a bit strange and futuristic talking to a computer, especially one which learns over time and is almost definitely smarter than you, maybe we're all just too set in our ways or — gasp — old-fashioned.  "I think it’ll take a while for us, people of our general age group, and certainly older generations as well," Siegler told Business Insider. "But if you look at kids, if you’ve ever seen any video of a kid with an Amazon Echo, it’s like their favorite thing in the world, talking to Alexa." Siegler compared voice-powered computing to the rise of using mobile devices like computers. What originally started with a mainframe server later became a desktop computer, which led to the laptop, and eventually the mobile phone.  Google's new Home device. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider "We’ve been squeezed into this paradigm of computing that was a direct result of the technology at the time," Siegler said. "These are all just constraints and they aren’t really a natural way." "It’s sort of weird to be typing and it’s sort of weird to be poking at a screen. How do we communicate with one another? We talk to each other and we listen," he said. While Siegler said talking to computers and using voice-powered devices is inevitable, investing in the technology is tricky. "The key thing that we have think about on the investing side is that those types of things feel inevitable, but it’s always a question of timing," he said. "Timing really matters when you’re trying to make an investment because obviously, you have to hit a certain window where something like that will be feasible on a large scale to become a good business." It's not there yet — but it will be GV's parent company Alphabet is already betting heavily on the verbal computing space with its new hardware products. The company unveiled its Google Home device in October, the company's first hardware device to incorporate its new digital Assistant. Much like Amazon's Alexa, the Assistant responds to your voice and is powered by artificial intelligence.  The Assistant is also available on Google's new Pixel phone and Allo chat app.  The Amazon Echo. Amazon Assistant follows in the footsteps of Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Microsoft's Cortana, all of which are voice-powered personal assistants.  But one critique with all of the voice assistants — and Google's in particular — is that activating them and speaking with them can be...creepy. To activate the Assistant, you have to say "Okay Google," which Business Insider's Dave Smith argued reminds users that you're speaking to and sharing information with a massive corporation that's storing your data. Beyond the broader implications of using voice-powered devices, Siegler admits that the technology itself isn't quite there yet — voice and image recognition is coming along, although it's not perfect by a long shot. Siegler himself  has created a "hack" using a Jawbone earpiece and his phone's accessibility settings to have everything read aloud to him, whether it's texts or news articles. Still, the technology that's currently available is a sign of progress and Siegler believes it's time we start coming around to the idea that in the future, we might never need to touch our phones. "Why is that weird?" he said. "It's weird because it hasn't been a normal thing for 50 years and it's not what we generally think of. But that's not to say that it won't be the normal thing in 10 years, in 20 years." SEE ALSO: Should you buy Google Home or the Amazon Echo?

Follow TechnoBuffalo Whenever you think of using the internet, the first thing that comes to mind is probably Google. Its services have flooded the market and made it nearly impossible to get anything done without using them. The best way to consume Google services is through its own web browser, Chrome, which just reached an epic milestone. According to Google, Chrome is now installed on over 2 billion devices. That number is insane. To give you some perspective, there are approximately 7.1 billion people on the earth. Google’s services, including Search, Maps, and YouTube, all blend seamlessly with Chrome. They all talk to each other, thus relaying important information from one service to the other. I think it’s the best browser I personally use it in on my MacBook Pro and makes my life a whole lot easier. The number of smartphones and computers on the market is only going to grow over the next couple of years, so 2 billion browsers might only be the beginning for Chrome, especially with the growth of Chromebooks and Android phones on the rise.

Here’s a brief summary of what we know so far: Australia’s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has announced a special “one-off” deal with the United States to resettlement some refugees from Nauru and Manus Island. It will not be available to any future boat arrivals if they are transferred to the regional processing centres. Considerable uncertainty remains about the number of refugees that will be eligible for resettlement and how quickly this process will occur. Turnbull said that family groups on Nauru would be a high priority. Refugee groups have cautiously welcomed the government’s resettlement deal but have called for greater clarity over the terms of the agreement and how it will operate. A 20-year temporary visa will also be available to refugees on Nauru who decline to travel to the United States if they are accepted for resettlement. The government has announced a major increase on the military side of Operation Sovereign Borders to turn back and prevent any further arrivals of asylum seekers by boat.

She’s currently on a secondment to the United Nations as part of a parliamentary delegation and she’s released this statement following the resettlement announcement: Senator Lisa Singh has declared the United Nations refugee summit to be a key influential factor in the Turnbull government’s resettlement announcement of refugees from Manus Island and Nauru. ‘Clearly the agreed outcomes from the UN refugee summit have been an influential factor. This highlights the important role of multilateral institutions and the pressure they can wield.’ Senator Singh is currently in New York where she has been seconded to the UN for three months as a parliamentary delegate. She participated in the recent UN refugee summit. Without knowing any further detail she welcomed the resettlement of refugees from Manus Island and Nauru but maintained it was long overdue. ‘Some of the key principles from the summit’s New York declaration were the political will to protect the human rights of refugees, to expand resettlement options and to end the practice of detaining children. ‘The Turnbull government agreed to the outcomes of the summit’s New York declaration, which has made it untenable for Australia to continue to lock refugees up indefinitely. “The Turnbull government has failed to protect the human rights of refugees on Manus Island and Nauru, particularly children. Indefinite detention has cost billions of dollars, harmed innocent people who sought our protection, and created damage to our international reputation. ‘The UN refugee summit, combined with the role the UNHCR will play in this resettlement arrangement, reinforces the importance of the UN as a global institution setting norms and standards. ‘This resettlement deal underlines the importance of the UN in helping to resolve refugee issues.’ Updated at 10.06pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.49pm EST 21:49 The prime minister posted this on his Facebook page shortly after making the resettlement announcement. The Australian government has a very extensive messaging program set up to deter asylum seekers from coming to Australia. Following the refugee resettlement announcement the government is likely to increase that messaging. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.43pm EST 21:43 We’ve pulled together a full report on the refugee resettlement detail. For all the details, check it out here: The Australian government has announced a landmark “one-off” resettlement deal to the United States for an unspecified number of refugees held at Australia’s remote offshore detention facilities on Nauru and Manus Island. On Sunday the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, announced a deal that would prioritise families, women and children for settlement with “the prospect” that others in offshore detention would be resettled in the US. “I can now confirm that the government has now reached a further third-party resettlement arrangement,” Turnbull said. “The agreement is with the United States. It is a one-off agreement. It will not be repeated. It is only available to those currently in the regional processing centres.” “It will not be available to any persons seeking to reach Australia in the future. Our priority is the resettlement of women, children and families.” At the press conference, at Maritime Border Command in Canberra, Turnbull refused to say how many refugees the deal would apply to but said the deal showed the government “can source and provide alternative resettlement options”. The remaining refugees on Nauru will be eligible for 20-year temporary visas on Nauru. The US resettlement would be contingent on vetting by the United States Homeland Security agency.

Oxfam Australia’s humanitarian policy adviser, Dr Nicole Bieske, said: The announcement from the government today to resettle people from Nauru must bring to an end Australia’s damaging offshore processing regime. ‘Oxfam is concerned that the agreement does not end the interminable limbo for all people on Manus Island and Nauru. ‘Australia has an obligation to the refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru and must bring to Australia anyone not covered by the agreement with the United States. ‘Many of these people have been in offshore detention for several years and have experienced severe psychological damage as a result of the policies of the Australian government. ‘While Oxfam welcomes the announcement that refugees from Nauru are to be resettled in the United States, the Australian government had an obligation to ensure that they were resettled in Australia and that they were supported and assisted to recover.’ Updated at 9.28pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.15pm EST 21:15 There’s been a lot of responses to far to the refugee resettlement deal. But perhaps the most important voices in all of this are from the refugees and asylum seekers themselves. We’ve asked Behrouz Boochani, who is being held on Manus Island, to write for us today about how he feels about the announcement. He’s outlined what the response has been so far on Manus Island: It’s hard for me to leave this island without any justice. What is my right as a human? It’s hard for me to accept this option because I feel that I’m not being treated as a human. People are so happy here but some people are so sad and this is unfair. They could do it three years ago, not now. I prefer to be in prison than leave this island without my friends, because I cannot accept injustice. If I could accept injustice, I would have stayed in Iran. I cannot forget my humanity, principles and values. I hope that people in Australia respect my decision. How can I leave this prison without my friends? I’m not the Australian government and I don’t want to be like them. I’m not a slave that they use for their political aims. It’s time we show people what humanity is and what human rights are.

Prime minister Turnbull today announced that the Australian government is in discussions with the United States for some of the refugees warehoused on Nauru and Manus Island to be settled in the US via a process administered by the UNHCR. “It is absolutely shameful that the Australian government has first sent several thousand people to languish for three years on Nauru and Manus Island, set up an offshore processing regime on Nauru that amounts to torture and is now passing the buck when it comes to offering them protection,” said Dr Graham Thom, refugee coordinator at Amnesty International Australia. “Australia is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and should be leading by example at a time of global record high levels of people forced to seek safety. Yet our Government is failing to play a fair part in providing sanctuary for those fleeing conflict and persecution, and this urgently needs to change. “Amnesty International has seen first hand the horrific abuse that is being inflicted on people in Nauru and on Manus Island, so we are pleased that for those who may be resettled in the US the abuse will come to an end and we acknowledge the US for giving people a genuine chance at settling and restarting their lives in a safe place. “What this announcement clearly shows is that the Australian government has finally acknowledged that Australia’s offshore processing policy is not tenable and Australia’s centres on Nauru and Manus Island must be urgently emptied and closed.” Updated at 9.15pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1 of 4 Newest Newer Older Oldest Topics Australian immigration and asylum Australian politics Migration Malcolm Turnbull Manus Island Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home election 2016 US world selected opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home election 2016 US world selected UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia selected cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video World › Australia › Australian immigration and asylum Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2016 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It wasn’t perfect but after a run of five straight defeats, and against southern hemisphere opponents to boot, they won’t complain too hard. Argentina were disappointing and the team that lit up the World Cup just a year ago could do with showing that they’re not just a flash in the pan after only managing one win in the Rugby Championship this year.

A poor pass from Sanches sends them backwards but they still have it. Senatore barrels to the 22 but the maul is formed and Jones, the man of the match, has won Wales a turnover and a scrum!

Biggar finds touch with the penalty on the left, just outside the 22. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.19pm EST 14:19 75 min Biggar goes very long and Hernandez returns to touch with interest. Halfpenny, looking to catch it on the full, keeps his eye on the ball and trips over a ball boy. Iglesias replaces Hernandez. Evidently Argentina don’t think they’ll need his boot. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.17pm EST 14:17 Penalty (Sanches 74) Wales 21-20 Argentina A touch surprisingly, they take the points from 30 metres.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.16pm EST 14:16 72 min Wales go left from the lineout midway inside Argentina’s half. It’s too quickly through the hand’s though and Jonathan Davies’s poor flapped pass for Liam Williams goes to touch. From that lineout Argentina attack at speed and get the penalty for a high tackle, I think.

After an exchange of kicks at the restart Biggar finds touch with a gorgeous banana kick on the run.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.05pm EST 14:05 63 min Desio slips through a tackle from the restart and Argentina are flying clear. They go up to halfway but then De la Fuente messes up his grubber and slices it into touch. For Argentina, Cubelli and Senatore are on for Landajo and Matera; for Wales Nicky Smith is on for Jenkins.

The scrum-half is scragged just short so Argentina go through the phases, inches out. Landajo darts and we’re going to the TMO. A few players celebrated and I think he might have got this.

Gethin Jenkins might be withdrawn soon too, I reckon, as he’s down having treatment before this Argentinian scrum 15 metres out. I imagine we’ll have a test of Liam Williams’ defensive attributes shortly, when Facundo Isa comes hurtling down his channel. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.58pm EST 13:58 58 min Isa barrels into Moriarty and Argentina are up to the Welsh 22, whence Matera carries it on another five metres. Solid defence around the fringes from Wales though – take note, South Africa – and this is very, very slow going. Jenkins wins the turnover but Charteris knocks on. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.56pm EST 13:56 57 min This time it’s a shallower restart and Wales struggle to gather it. The ball bounces to the try-scorer Gavin Davies, who then thumps it directly into touch from just outside his 22. Good lineout position for Argentina on the left. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.55pm EST 13:55 Try!

Gethin Jenkins of all people pops a beauty of a chip towards the corner and Cordero, covering back, doesn’t have a tight enough turning circle and his heel just brushes the touchline. Five metre lineout to Wales... Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.52pm EST 13:52 53 min Wales comes off the back of the scrum and probe for holes in midfield. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.50pm EST 13:50 51 min Penalty Argentina from the lineout for obstruction but Hernandez’s kick to touch is kept in play by Liam Williams, flying to tap it back in. The Pumas must come from deep but a poor pop pass from Botta forces Sanches to drop it 12 metres inside his own half. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.49pm EST 13:49 50 min Well that came from nowhere but that is sort of Argentina’s thing. From the restart, Landajo makes a cracking exit, finding touch around halfway on the right. The Pumas are making changes: Herrera returns and Botta replaces Noguera.

In the olden days of brick-and-mortar businesses, the three most important factors determining a business’ success were location, location, location. In today’s digital world, not much has changed in that regard; the three factors remain location, location, location (on the Google results page, of course). Being found online when a user types in a keyword in a search engine can determine the success or failure of your company. Having a top ranking site on Google can bring your company tremendous benefits, including: a . More than 90% of buying decisions begin online. Having your website rank at the top of search engine results will provide your brand visibility. b. Top positioned sites get more traffic: In fact, research shows that the first 10 results on Google, which make up page one of the search results, receive close to 90% of all click-through traffic. Increasing your ranking will not only bring you more traffic, but it will bring your business more authenticity and trust. Having a top search engine ranking position (SERP) will help your company reduce inbound marketing and advertising costs effectively and impact your social media marketing. If you’ve gotten to page 1, congrats! You’ve done a great job, but that doesn’t mean you get to rest on your laurels. Maintaining your top ranking status is just as difficult as making it there. This is where content marketing comes into play. ‘Content is king’ has become somewhat cliché, but only because it is true. Marketers around the world and across almost every industry have embraced content as a way to improve branding, loyalty, web traffic and lead generation. But that is not all – content marketing can do wonders for your company and you should be focusing on it to grow your brand. Here are the top 10 reasons why you should focus on content marketing: Search Engine Optimization The more unique, well-written, engaging, socially shared and buzz-worthy your content is, the higher your ranking will be. 1. Build trust : A recent study by Nielsen revealed that 90% of consumers trust brand recommendations from friends and users online. Content marketing has been categorized as some form of word of mouth, so putting your brand in front of your audience in a way that THEY value can help you showcase your expertise and become an authority on a subject. In financial trading, where clients are giving your company their hard-earned money, building trust is particularly critical. Show your audience that you care by providing them with information that will help them in their trading career. Educational materials in the form of videos, white papers and blog posts will help you build loyalty and lengthen a client’s lifetime value. 2. Branding : Branding is one of the top KPIs set for content marketing. Simply put, the more content you put out there, the more recognition your brand will get. Producing useful, original and quality content is one of the best ways in which your business can position itself as a category leader, and promote and reinforce its brand. With most FX brokerages having virtually the same offerings in terms of platforms, compensation structures, bonuses and such, content can be that added value to help position your brand and differentiate yourself from the bunch. 3. Increase web traffic : Content marketing is a key ingredient in gaining organic traffic to your website. The content you produce gets indexed by the search engines, which turns into greater chances of getting organic traffic, so the more content you produce, the higher your organic traffic will be and because organic traffic is earned, not paid, you will keep reaping the benefits as long as you keep producing good content. Aside from your self-generated organic web traffic, if you produce valuable content, other website owners may find it valuable enough to share with their audience, which will boost your web traffic even more. Inbound links from sites belonging to influential people, such as bloggers and industry experts, will convey to users that you are an expert in your field and will let search engines know that your site is qualitative. 4. Social distribution : Your content marketing pieces are great material to distribute through your social media channels. Update your social media presence with your content by creating posts, tweets, snaps, pins, etc that can be shared by your audience with their friends, family and colleagues, helping your content reach a wider audience and in some lucky instances, become viral. But don’t stop at just posting. Today’s marketing is not a one-way street. Listening to your audience and engaging in real-time interactions can help you build your brand and obtain valuable insight into the way your customers think and act, giving you key information about the best ways in which you should be communicating with them. 5. Engage : Great content that is designed to help, entertain and inspire your audience will keep readers engaged and coming back for more. Every time a user comes back to your website, your social media page, reads your newsletter, etc, is a chance for them to be exposed to your brand and an opportunity for them to buy your products or services. 6.Great ROI Pairing great content with the correct calls-to-action will improve your company’s conversion process. Content has proved to be so effective that some researchers have made claims as bold as the fact that content marketing produces 3 times more leads for every dollar spent than SEM. Even if half of the numbers in that statement are true, content still gives other pieces of the marketing mix a good run for their money. Your investment in developing content does not only prove worth it as soon as you develop and publish a certain piece, but it continues to be relevant for a long time since good content stays. Moreover, if you create great content, other media outlets and influencers may decide to mention it and share it, thus exponentially increasing your reach, producing thousands of dollars’ worth of ‘free’ brand exposure. Influence decision making Studies show that over 92% of the purchasing process today happens before the client even talks to anyone at your company, so providing customers with information that can help them make a decision in favor of your brand is important. As customers begin their research process, they’ll talk to friends, read reviews, visit forums and ask on social media about your products and services. Give them the opportunity to come across your content, let them find value in it, so by the time they contact your company, they have already been convinced to buy from you. @Climaxbox we can make your website appear on First page on Google ,Bing amd Yahoo .

Owners of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge can now sign up for the program.  ( Samsung ) Advertisement One of Android's biggest problems is fragmentation, which keeps the latest and greatest version of the OS from making it to many devices fast. Samsung is looking to end that by launching the Android 7.0 Nougat Galaxy Beta Program for Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. Before Google unveiled its new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, its Nexus handsets were the devices Android smartphone fans flocked to since they came with the guarantee of receiving Android OS updates directly from Google. The Pixel and Pixel XL continue Google's tradition of getting timely Android updates. Now, the biggest Android smartphone maker is addressing the Android fragmentation issue. Samsung Addresses Android Fragmentation Issue Samsung has just announced the Android 7.0 Nougat Galaxy Beta Program for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. The company is allowing users in the U.S., UK and South Korea to sign up for the beta program. Users in China will gain access to the program shortly, according to the company. Samsung notes that users can apply for the program and will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. "Throughout the Galaxy Beta Program period**, users can get a feel for Android 7.0 Nougat*** with Samsung's latest UX, and can provide feedback on performance, reliability and usability. Users' responses will in turn help Samsung develop reliable, high-performing software and provide an improved and optimized experience to all Galaxy users," according to a post on Samsung's website. "Users that have an active Samsung Account and meet program requirements may apply for the program by downloading the Galaxy Beta Program app through Galaxy Apps or the Samsung Members app which is available through the Google Play store or Galaxy Apps depending on their country of residence." This program is only available to Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge users, Galaxy S7 edge Olympic Games Limited Edition and Galaxy S7 edge Injustice Edition device owners will not have access to the beta program. UK users must have a non-operator locked handset to take part in the program. Android 7.0 Nougat Features Some of the best new features in Android 7.0 Nougat include new power savings enhancements that will squeeze more battery life out of your smartphone. Building on Google's Doze feature, which debuted in Android 6.0 Marshmallow, Nougat's "Doze on the Go" kicks in whenever the display is off, even if the phone is in motion, saving precious battery life. Multi-window app support was already a feature Samsung offered on its Galaxy Note phablets but Android 7.0 Nougat brings the feature to all smartphones. Users are able to open two apps and display the apps side by side on the screen. For instance, you can surf the web while messaging, or write an email while watching a YouTube video, which brings enhanced multitasking to Android 7.0 Nougat. Have you signed up for the Android 7.0 Nougat Galaxy Beta Program on your Galaxy S7 or S7 edge and taken it for a spin? What do you think of it? Please let us know in the comments below.

This feature is available on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL devices, but not in the previous flagship devices of the company, namely the Nexus 5X or the Nexus 6P. According to Google, the issue here is the firmware, not the hardware, and both Nexus devices run on old firmware which doesn’t support fingerprint gestures. Apparently, this feature would allow the users to simply swipe over the fingerprint scanner in order to access the notification panel. It might not seem like much, but it is really useful. The gesture was not brought to Nexus 5X and 6P, even though both of the devices run on the latest update for the Android Nougat OS. Besides this, Google may also bring the “night light” feature found on the Pixel and Pixel XL to the Nexus models, according to Android Police. If you don’t know what this is about, this feature brings a red tint to the screen in order to cut down on the blue light. Research has previously shown that blue light has a negative effect on sleeping patterns. Users have declared themselves quite unhappy with the changes Google made and with the fact that they are taking away features on purpose from the Nexus devices. This is especially bothering them because up until now Nexus was the standard for the best Android experience you can get, and now it’s being dethroned by other brands. Meanwhile, Google seems keen on making people use more and more of its smartphones, and for this they have recently released a bevy of videos with the “Phone by Google” theme as a marketing campaign. Also, they published a video with instructions for those who want to switch from iPhone to Pixel.

On Friday, she was a guest on "Bloomberg Studio 1.0" to discuss what role the streaming video unit plays within the greater Alphabet family. Wojcicki was asked why YouTube isn't a standalone company and still part of Google. The executive said YouTube remains an important part of Google and runs on its infrastructure. She added that YouTube also tasks Google's ad sales team to sell its ad inventory but still considers YouTube to be a "company within Google" yet maintain its own standalone brand. Investment Mode Moving on to growing YouTube, Wojcicki said the top priority at YouTube is to "continue growing the business in a big growth area." She expanded that by all measures, television is a bigger market than online streaming, videos but millennials are watching less TV these days which creates a tremendous opportunity for YouTube to capitalize on. "I do think if you look at the millennial audience you do see their behavior really shifting from traditional TV to online," she said. Faced with this opportunity, Wojcicki said YouTube is "definitely in investment mode" so that users will be able to watch "whatever show they want."

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS Google fails to patch Chrome browser bug -- Microsoft Windows users at risk of scams By Brian Fagioli Published 6 days ago 50 Comments Tweet Many people use Google Chrome, and rightfully so. The cross-platform web browser works brilliantly, and is super-fast. Plus, the search-giant's browser is very secure too, right? Not so fast... Today, Sophos drops a bombshell by revealing that scammers are actively targeting Chrome users by leveraging a bug. These bad guys pose as Microsoft tech support and display an in-browser message that says the user's computer is infected with "Virus Trojan.worm! 055BCCAC9FEC". To make matters worse, Google has apparently known about the exploit for more than two years and simply failed to patch it. "Tech support scammers have started exploiting a two-year-old bug in Google Chrome to trick victims into believing their PC is infected with malware. The bug was discovered in Chrome 35 in July 2014 in the history.pushState() HTML5 function, a way of adding web pages into the session history without actually loading the page in question. The developer who reported the issue published code showing how to add so many items into Chrome’s history list that the browser would effectively freeze", says Sophos. The company further says, "beating the attack isn't hard. Users can either close Chrome using the Task Manager or, in cases where the browser is using up so much processor power that Task Manager doesn’t appear, by rebooting the computer. The chances of encountering this particular scam are small -- it's only been spotted on a single website -- but its existence underlines how small bugs that don’t seem terribly important may nevertheless be abused by cyercriminals down the line". Sophos shares the full fake message below. Remember, the computer is not really infected, scammers are trying to trick the user. Microsoft Identification-Malware infected website visited. Malicious data transferred to system from unauthorized access. System Registry files may be changed and can be used for unethical activities. System has been infected by Virus Trojan.worm! 055BCCAC9FEC -- Personal information (Bank Details, Credit Cards and Account Password) may be stolen. While all Chrome users are at risk, the scammers are currently pretending to be Microsoft tech support, making Windows users the real at-risk people. In other words, this scam would not likely be effective on users of macOS or Linux-based operating systems. Still, scammers could alter the scheme to target other operating systems too. Even though the risk is rather low, Google still owes it to all its Chrome users to have a safe and secure browser with a focus on security. Ignoring a bug for two years is simply unacceptable. Hopefully the company patches the 2014 bug soon. Does this lower your confidence in the overall safety of Google Chrome? Tell me in the comments.

Why an undamaged mummy uncovered in Luxor will stay in Egypt Why some Jewish groups won't denounce Steve Bannon appointment Much of Silicon Valley was shocked to learn Donald Trump was elected president. Now, they're asking themselves how they can work with him to improve the country's tech sector.  By Ben Rosen, Staff November 9, 2016 Save for later Saved President-elect Donald Trump speaks during an election night rally in New York on Wednesday. Evan Vucci/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Most of Silicon Valley didn’t receive the news Donald Trump was elected president on Tuesday well. One startup founder went on an expletive-laden rant, melting down onstage at a conference in Portugal. An AOL co-founder expressed “disappointment” in a Twitter post. Two investors even pledged to fund a campaign for California to secede from the rest of the nation. Aside from a select few including Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, the technology industry has indignantly opposed the Trump campaign. But now that Mr. Trump has upset Hillary Clinton, the industry is asking itself how it can work with a president whose positions it resented. Some leaders and observers have voiced concern over how Trump could affect the immigration of highly skilled workers, as well as internet privacy and cybersecurity. Others have urged caution because, they say, it all depends on the company president-elect Trump keeps.   Recommended: What do you know about Donald Trump? Anne Weismann, executive director of the Washington-based Campaign for Accountability, cites Maureen Ohlhausen, a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as most likely to chair the FTC for Trump. Test your knowledge What do you know about Donald Trump? Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/14 “Tech companies would have nothing to fear from the FTC under Olhausen,” Ms. Weismann writes Wednesday in an email to The Christian Science Monitor, referring to Ms. Olhausen’s general opposition to strong antitrust or privacy enforcement. Olhausen “would be a huge gift” to Google, writes Weismann. She also mentions Mr. Thiel, an ardent Libertarian who has downplayed competition and praised monopolies such as Google. After Thiel publicly endorsed Trump and gave $1.25 million to his campaign last month, some wondered if he  was angling for an appointment in the Trump administration, according to The Wall Street Journal. The problem with speculating, however, is that Trump has painted a broad picture of some of his policies, while offering conflicting statements about how he views the Valley. Trump told The New York Times in June he has “ great respect for Silicon Valley.” But he also repeatedly attacked industry leaders and policies that affect them. Trump alleged that Google had manipulated its search results to favor Mrs. Clinton. He also threw barbs at Amazon’s Jeff Bezos over the company’s taxes, prompting Mr. Bezos to propose Trump be launched into space. Any outright conflict with the technology sector would be a shift from the close relationship the Obama administration and the industry have, as Max Lewontin reported for The Christian Science Monitor:  President Obama appointed the first chief technology officer in 2009, a chair that’s now occupied by Megan Smith, a veteran of Google. He has pushed for the Federal Communication’s approval of rules on net neutrality, a cause supported by many prominent tech figures. In July, an open letter signed by 150 current and former executives of technology firms signed warned that Trump could reverse that. "We believe that government plays an important role in the technology economy by investing in infrastructure, education and scientific research," the letter reads. "Donald Trump articulates few policies beyond erratic and contradictory pronouncements. His reckless disregard for our legal and political institutions threatens to upend what attracts companies to start and scale in America." One consistent concern of the industry has been how Trump’s promises to cut back on immigration could affect its efforts to attract more skilled foreign workers under the H-1B visa program. The program is intended to keep talented workers in the US by offering them a path to a green card. Silicon Valley has lobbied to raise the cap of the program above 85,000 people a year. " The big unknown is whether a Donald Trump presidency will lead to a technology immigration talent drain, either by choice or by policy," writes Shira Ovide, a columnist for Bloomberg. "Of course it's not clear what immigration policies might be pursued by the incoming Trump administration or by a Congress with a clear Republican majority in both the House and Senate. During his campaign, of course, Trump advocated for stricter limits on immigration." On Wednesday, some venture capitalists were that hopeful Trump’s anti-regulation policies would benefit businesses.   "I think if you look at what Trump should be is pro-business, so based on his speech this morning, you hope that he understands the magnitude of the office he just got," Jeff Schumacher, the chief executive of BCG Digital Ventures, told CNBC. But the president-elect's threats to impose steep tariffs on goods manufactured in China would hurt companies such as Apple that depend on a global supply-chain, Gregory Autry, an assistant professor at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California, told TechCrunch.  “Trump is definitely a problem for that model,” said Dr. Autry. “His economic policies are focused on punishing China for its trade abuses and returning manufacturing to the U.S.” Analysts are also split on how the Trump administration would address cybersecurity and internet freedom. According to Newsweek, Trump has promised to develop cyber-weapons to protect against threats such as North Korea and China. But he also said he is against net neutrality – the principle all internet service providers should treat traffic equally – and said that in the event of a cyber war he would close parts of the internet. Then, there are some who have said the Trump's campaign was full of "false advertising," meaning there are policies he just won't follow through with. "I think actually his policies, I bet you, are going to embrace a lot of Democratic values in terms of how they are enacted. I think a lot of incendiary stuff he put out there was to get elected," Mood Rowghani, a general partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, said in a panel discussion at the Web Summit conference in Portugal on Wednesday, according to CNBC.

News Photos Ticket Sports Obits E-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Google Daydream has a great controller Sunday Nov 13, 2016 at 2:01 AM By Anick JesdanunAP Technology Writer NEW YORK — The best thing about Google's new virtual-reality headset isn't the headset at all. In fact, Daydream View would pale compared with Samsung's Gear VR headset were it not for Daydream's controller, a handheld device that responds to gestures and other motions. With Gear VR, I have to move my head to point a cursor at something, then reach for a button on the headset. With Daydream, I can just aim and click the controller in my hand. Sensors in the device tell the headset what I'm trying to do, whether it's swinging a tennis racket or casting a fishing rod. The headset's display responds accordingly. The headset and controller went on sale together Thursday for $79. No rush in getting one, though, as the virtual experiences built for Daydream are still limited. And for now, it works only with Google's Pixel phone. The many flavors of VR While sophisticated systems like Facebook's Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive let you walk around in the virtual world, Daydream View is a sit-down experience in which you use the controller to move yourself around. (You could walk around with the Daydream on if you wanted to, but you won't go anywhere in virtual space — and you might run into the wall.) But the Rift and the Vive each costs more than $1,500, once you include powerful personal computers they require. So $79 is a bargain. Daydream stays cheap by using the display and processing power of your phone, which you insert into the headset at eye level. Gear VR, at $100, takes a similar approach, but it works only with Samsung phones. While Daydream works only with Pixel for now, several other makers of Android devices plan to make compatible phones. Sorry, iPhone users. Those without compatible phones still have Google Cardboard, a $15 contraption you hold up to your face. Using Daydream View, by contrast, is more like wearing goggles. While Gear VR has a better fit, with focusing and a second strap over your head to keep the headset from sliding too low, Daydream is much more comfortable to wear and use than Cardboard. About that controller Those who've played Nintendo's Wii system will find the Daydream controller familiar. It's about the size and shape of a chocolate bar, and it has motion sensors to track movement. Although I'm not a big gamer, I enjoyed shooting water out of a hose to put out fires. You simply hold a button to spray and move the controller around to douse flames. You can even tilt the controller to control the angle of the hose. Another app lets you explore the universe by using the controller as a laser pointer to bring up more information. The controller makes it easier to navigate menus without making yourself dizzy; just move it around to point at things. And while getting the full 360-degree experience of VR often requires spinning around (a swivel chair helps), some apps in Daydream let you grab the scene with your controller and drag it around you, just as you would with a PC mouse. It's also handy to have volume controls and a home button in your hand rather than on your head. Nausea free? VR can be nauseating, and Daydream is no different. I found that it's less about the headset, and more about the VR video. The best videos use stationary cameras and let you move your head (or controller) around to explore. The nauseating ones tend to treat VR cameras like regular movie cameras, with a lot of panning in response to a subject's movements. The viewer, not the subject, should be the one doing the moving. And while I enjoyed watching a woman skydive in VR on YouTube, scenes of her preparing to jump felt jarring because the camera was on her shaky arm. I had to remove my headset. Places to go lacking You can view 360-degree YouTube videos and any 360-degree photos you store on Google Photos. You can visit other destinations such as the Galapagos Islands in a 360-degree version of Google's Street View. A few games, museum artworks and The Wall Street Journal's app were also available to try out before Thursday's launch. A handful more were to come out Thursday. Even more are promised by the end of the year, including apps for Netflix and Hulu — though all that does is offer video on a giant screen in a virtual living room. There's much more available for Cardboard. App developers will need to make some tweaks to make them compatible with Daydream. They'll need to do even more to take advantage of the motion control. Daydream has promise, but until more apps arrive, its potential is still a dream.

Google uses Chrome's reach to give your phone a better web 0 Share: Software by Stephen Shankland 11 November 2016 6:29 am AEDT @stshank Up Next Facebook may have built then ditched an update to fight fake news A Google Chrome lapel pin Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET The web has taken a beating in the smartphone era. But it's about to start beating back. Explosive growth of the web, starting in the 1990s, connected the world's population. In the last decade, though, we all started tapping app icons instead of web hyperlinks to chat with friends, share photos and buy products online. Now Google's Chrome team and browser allies from Mozilla, Opera and Microsoft are putting a new twist on things. It's called progressive web apps, or PWAs. They endow websites with many of the advantages of native apps that run on Google's Android or Apple's iOS. And they can outdo native apps when it comes to fast, hassle-free loading. PWAs are headlining this week at the Chrome Dev Summit, Google's two-day conference in San Francisco for programmers who want to figure out where Google is taking browser technology. Native apps hog the spotlight, but at the conference, Google will reveal a good reason why browsers generally and Chrome in particular also deserve a place on the stage: unbeatable reach. "We have over 2 billion Chrome instances that are active" each month, said Darin Fisher, Google's vice president of Chrome engineering and the conference's opening speaker. That amounts to fewer than 2 billion people, because a single person can use Chrome on multiple devices, but it's still a platform with immense power. That power is essential to making Google's vision a reality. If it succeeds, that browser icon might be the one you reach for on your home screen a lot more often. Website usage tracking firm StatCounter says browser use on mobile devices just exceeded PC browsing worldwide. Photo by StatCounter Success on that front also could help restore the fortunes of the web, the closest the computing industry has come to freeing us from software that works only on one device or another, like a Windows laptop but not an iPhone. In an era when tech giants wield tremendous power, the web levels the playing field and makes it easier for new competitors to join the game. It's no wonder Google is pushing the mobile web. This month, browser usage on tablets and phones for the first time surpassed usage on PCs, analytics firm StatCounter said. App fatigue Apps might get the glory, but the web does a lot of the work already. When we need to interact with a business or service, a website is often our first point of contact. Apps are popular, with millions available in Apple and Google app stores, but it's hard to convince people to install them, and even then, most lie dormant. Among American adults, "almost half...report that they use five or fewer apps at least once per week, and just 16 percent indicate that they use more than 10 apps on a regular basis," a 2016 Pew Research Center study found. And Localytics, which monitors app usage, found that 23 percent of users never reopen an app after the first time and that only about a fifth of people are likely to still use an app after three months. Darin Fisher, vice president of Chrome engineering, speaks at Google's Chrome Dev Summit. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Fisher isn't pronouncing native apps dead, but he thinks PWAs means the web can shoulder more of the load. "It's expensive to get people to install an app," Fisher said, but progressive web apps arrive fast through the browser to keep visitors happy, then download extra abilities silently in the background. For website developers, he said, "there's really no fundamental limit to the kinds of experiences you can create." There's a place for both apps and websites, analyst firm Gartner believes. "A mobile website is more generic, with wider reach, like your ABC or CBS or Fox or NBC channels," said Research Director Jason Wong, while native apps are akin to "a cable channel like the Cooking Channel or MTV targeted toward a specific segment." Apps are great for people who use a company's services are lot, like the 10 percent or 15 percent of users who come back to an e-commerce site frequently, but websites are crucial for the rest. "The mobile web is unavoidable. Users are using smartphones and tablets to access websites more and more. Google has changed its [search] algorithm to reward mobile-optimized websites," Wong said. "It's imperative companies move to responsive and mobile-optimized websites." Progressive web what? If you're browsing the web, you won't see any fancy label announcing a progressive web app. But done well, you'll like it. The first idea behind a PWA is that websites arrive as fast as possible in basic form so you can get started immediately, then gradually flesh themselves out in the background -- thus the term progressive. Compare that to a typical native app that often requires you to download tens of megabytes of data and wait for an installation before you can get started. They're not for every situation right now -- games, for example. But PWAs can be appropriate for lots of situations with native apps, like social networking, e-commerce, news and streaming video. PWAs also download components so they work offline. And they take advantage of push notification abilities for the web -- for example, Carnival Cruise's site can prompt customers to finalize a reservation before it expires in 24 hours. And PWAs can be placed as a home-screen icon so you're more likely to use them again. The results have convinced companies like the Washington Post, Housing.com in India and Chinese e-commece giant Alibaba. Also, CNET launched its own progressive web app Thursday.

Among Android device users, monthly usage increased 30 percent, and for those with iPhones and iPads, monthly usage increased 14 percent. PWAs are particularly popular in developing countries where mobile networks are slow and coverage is spotty, said Alex Komoroske, a Chrome group product manager. Using a cheap, low-end Android phone with an older 3G connection, downloading FlipKart's e-commerce native app took 14 minutes, but the company's progressive web app took 14 seconds, he said. Where's Apple? Google has built into Chrome much of the required supporting technology, including push notifications. Mozilla's Firefox and Microsoft's Edge are on board, too, making it safer for web programmers to bet on PWAs. Apple hasn't joined the party with its Safari browser, but Fisher is optimistic. If 50,000 website developers start using PWA technologies, "you can imagine Safari engineers will see there's a lot of interest," Fisher said. "Developers can have some influence, voting with their feet for what they care about." Apple didn't respond to a request for comment. Apple forbids other browser makers from using their own browser engines on iPhones and iPads, so running Chrome doesn't enable PWAs on those devices. Apple's lack of support is "a real concern for developers," Fisher said, but embracing the PWA approach still boosts performance on Apple's iOS-powered devices. Easier payments And progressive web apps will benefit from web payment technology where Apple is ahead, letting you easily complete a purchase with Apple Pay. A more general technology, the web payments interface, is coming to mobile browsers to connect to Android Pay , a credit card, Alibaba's AliPay service, Apple Pay, or whatever other payment mechanism your phone offers. It all leads to vast improvements over the plodding, hard-to-read websites still common with mobile browsing. "Everybody should be building a progressive web app," Fisher said. "It just makes sense."

Are owners of the smartphone safe from the exploit?  ( Google ) Advertisement The Google Pixel, a device that is being considered as possibly the best Android smartphone to date, has just been hacked by Chinese team in less than 60 seconds. The feat was achieved by white hat hackers from security solutions company Qihoo 360 at PwnFest, a hacking competition held in Seoul, South Korea. The Google Pixel Hack At PwnFest, Qihoo 360 demonstrated an exploit that gave the team access for remote code execution on the Google Pixel. Using a zero-day vulnerability, the team hacked the smartphone in less than 60 seconds, allowing them to remotely install code on the smartphone. The exploit allowed Qihoo 360 to launch the Google Play Store and the mobile version of the Google Chrome browser, with a message that read "Pwned by 360 Alpha Team" displayed on the Google Pixel afterwards. The hackers were also able to gain full remote access to the smartphone, allowing them to access all the personal information stored in the device, including messages, contacts, phone calls and content such as photos. Are Google Pixel Owners Safe? Fortunately, as the Qihoo 360 team is made up of white hat hackers, they were not interested in using the exploit for criminal applications. They did come away with a cash prize of $120,000 though, after their demonstration of the hack. The team has also sent over the details of the Google Pixel vulnerability to Google, with the company now working on a patch that will protect owners of the smartphone from the security issue. Google Pixel Security Issues Early this month, Android director of security Adrian Ludwig said that the Google Pixel and the iPhone of rival Apple are on the same level when it comes to security, a bold claim considering that Android is far more vulnerable to hacking due to its open source nature and various customizations. However, last month at the Mobile Pwn2Own event in Japan, Tencent's Keen Labs were also able to breach the security of the smartphone. The software of the Google Pixel itself even carries its own vulnerability, as the Trusted Voice feature that allows users to unlock the smartphone through a voice command is enabled by default, despite its many potential security concerns. Other Hacking Victims At PwnFest PwnFest saw the security measures of many other devices and software fall in attacks launched by white hat hackers. Among the victims are Apple's updated Safari on MacOS Sierra, Adobe Flash, Microsoft Edge and VMWare Workstation. Qihoo 360 walked away from the event with a total of $520,000 in prizes.

Along with Microsoft, Google is creating new competition for the largest player, Smart Technologies. Google joins competition ‘to redefine meetings’ The Washington Post Nov 13, 2016 (…) Google has entered the increasingly competitive market for interactive whiteboards with the release of its Jamboard. Along with Microsoft, Google is creating new competition for the largest player, Smart Technologies. The latest product to be unveiled by tech giant Google was not a new smartphone or wearable device or search feature designed to be used by millions of everyday consumers. Rather, it was a $6,000 whiteboard designed to be used in your office conference room. The release of Jamboard puts the Silicon Valley behemoth into the niche but increasingly competitive market of interactive whiteboards, the high-tech equivalent of those dry-erase boards that employees use to scrawl out diagrams, lead presentations or brainstorm new ideas. Microsoft and Google have both gotten into the interactive whiteboard market this year, creating new competition for the largest and most entrenched player, Smart Technologies, a Canadian firm recently acquired by Foxconn. “The last piece of equipment in the office and classroom that hasn’t made it into the modern age is the whiteboard,” said Smart Technologies chief technology officer Warren Barkley. “We, along with Microsoft and Google, see this as an opportunity to move that static, physically isolated content into the wider world.” Though commonplace today, the standard whiteboard is an innovation itself. Popularized in the late 1980s and 1990s, the whiteboard has, in many instances, replaced the dusty blackboard. The digital whiteboard is a more modern invention, and it continues to evolve. Smart Technologies takes credit for creating the first interactive whiteboard in 1991. Barkley said those were primarily large display devices that used projectors and had maybe one or two touch points. Today, interactive whiteboards come with LED touch screens whose ease of use more closely resembles a tablet computer. That evolution has come with fits and starts, he said, and new arrivals could advance it further. Google’s Jamboard is a 55-inch, touch-screen monitor that connects to the cloud and taps into Google’s G Suite of productivity apps, including Google Drive, Docs and Calendar. Equipped with machine learning technology, the board is marketed as a tool for companies to make information gathering and brainstorming more seamless. As senior product manager T.J. Varghese said in a recent blog post, “At Google, we’ve set out to redefine meetings.” Varghese wrote in an email that the company will first offer Jamboard to the roughly 2 million customers who subscribe to its workplace software, and it will review how those businesses put the board to use before selling it to other corporate customers. It’s unclear whether Jamboard will have a meaningful impact on Google’s income. It strikes a different tone from the company’s other products, which are generally lower cost and marketed to the masses, because the electronic whiteboard is distinctly aimed at a business crowd with a hefty IT budget. Google also faces stiff competition in the workplace technology market, said Vanessa Thompson, a research analyst at IDC, a market research firm specializing in technology. In March, Microsoft began shipping its own interactive whiteboard, called Surface Hub. Much as Jamboard integrates with Google’s other products, Surface Hub integrates with Microsoft’s established slate of workplace software, including Skype and Microsoft Office. The 55-inch Surface Hub sells for $8,999, and the 84-inch version goes for $21,999. “At the very highest level, I would say almost every company today is going through some form of digital transformation,” said Julia Atalla, senior director of Microsoft’s Windows and Devices group. “Medium- to large-size businesses, they’re looking at ways they can innovate faster.” Interactive whiteboard purveyors say their products meet that need. Having a digital interface that all workers in a meeting can connect with to share information, video conference and otherwise engage makes those gatherings more productive, they say. But IT trends could also make the large capital investment needed to purchase the boards harder to justify, Thompson of IDC said. “There are some macro trends impacting the way we work, like decentralization in large organizations, small team-oriented work, personal productivity tools augmenting tools provided by organizations,” Thompson said. “These behavioral themes mean that workers are just as likely to use personal tools to share and collaborate as they are a space in the office.” Tags Google Whiteboard Microsoft Company Featured Businesses Le Peep Restaurant |Breakfast | Lunch | North Park 2012 N 117th Ave , Omaha, NE 68164 402-991-8222 Currently Open State Farm Insurance Agent - Judd Knispel 1860 Madison Ave, Ste 2, Council Bluffs, IA 51503 712-325-0256 Dr. Josh Evans 8901 Indian Hills Dr, Omaha , NE 68114 402-397-7057 Currently Open Best Black Friday Ads & Deals | Sales | Omaha World-Herald Black Friday Ad Headquarters 1314 Douglas St., Omaha, NE 68102 Currently Open Puerto Vallarta Mexican Restaurant 4871 L Street, Omaha, NE 68117 402-905-0759 Currently Open Tish's Restaurant 1207 S 35th St, Council Bluffs, IA 51501 712-323-5456 Currently Open World-Herald 150 Stocks In case you missed it Two metro-area Shopkos to close at the end of January No certainty that new hedge fund drawn to Conagra will act as activist 'Strategic alternatives'?

Craig saves Greg and Natalie, for totally nailing the dance this time round. Darcey saves them too, but Bruno saves Daisy and Aljaz! Ooh, TENSION. So it’s down to Len, and he chooses brain over heart and saves GREG AND NATALIE! Goodness, that was close. So DAISY AND ALJAZ are going home tonight, and take the opportunity to say lovely things about each other. Ah Daisy, you’ve been delightful. But in a year packed with big personalities, being perfectly charming and nice and wasn’t going to cut it I’m afraid. Such is the way of Strictly.

Lowlights: Daisy and Aljaz’s Salsa (bad night to do a Salsa, Daijaz), Ore and Joanne’s frigid Rumba, and the absence of Chaz and Dave.

Mark Lennihan — The Associated Press By Troy Wolverton, Tech Files Posted: 11/12/16, 3:39 PM PST | Updated: 2 days ago # Comments Having a smart speaker like Amazon Echo or Google Home in the house can feel like you’ve stepped into the future. It can also feel creepy. And sometimes, really annoying. All these impressions coursed through me over the past several days as I tested Echo and Home. I’m still not sure I’d want one in my house, but I can certainly understand their appeal. Home debuted last month as Google’s answer to Echo, which Amazon first released two years ago. Both look like simple speakers, because they lack screens and have few buttons. But looks are deceiving. Sure, both can serve as wireless speaker systems. But more significant, they serve as conduits for powerful artificial intelligence algorithms that can do everything from answering basic questions to ordering products and services to controlling a connected home. Both smart speakers do a very good job at this latter role. I asked bunches of questions of both speakers and made lots of requests. In the vast majority of cases, both understood what I wanted the first time I asked them and responded or complied right away. I asked them to order an Uber. I asked for restaurant recommendations and to play a particular channel on Pandora. And I asked them about the latest exchange rate between euros and dollars. In each of those cases, they had a ready answer or followed my request without problem. It was like being on board the Starship Enterprise, being able to talk to a disembodied computer with the expectation that it would understand and follow my every command. Before asking anything of either speaker, you have to use a trigger word to essentially wake it up. With the Echo, it’s simply “Alexa.” With Home, it’s “OK Google.” Both speakers were very responsive when called upon — and much more reliable in that respect than Apple’s Siri on my iPhone 6S, which has similar capabilities. I’m constantly repeating “Hey, Siri” — the iPhone’s trigger phrase — because Apple’s intelligent assistant responds only about half the time I call it. Out of the box, both smart speakers will do quite a few things. They can tell you how many calories are in a McDonald’s Big Mac, add items to a shopping list and even tell you jokes. But both have their limitations. If you ask Echo what’s happening in the stock market, it will play you a prerecorded news clip that may or may not have updates on the major stock indexes. When I asked Home the same question, it said it couldn’t do that yet — even though it’s supposed to be able to. Some of these limitations can be solved by rephrasing your question or request. In most cases, though, you have to teach the speakers new tricks by adding on features or connecting them to other services using their corresponding smartphone apps. Advertisement So if you want to order an Uber through Echo, you have to link your Uber account to it via Amazon’s Alexa smartphone app. If you want to use Home to order your Chromecast to start playing music on your stereo system, you have to set that up in the Google Home smartphone app. For the Echo, many of these add-on capabilities come through what Amazon calls “skills,” which are kind of like apps for the speaker. These skills can help Echo match some of Home’s built-in capabilities — like translating from one language to another. But they also give it a decided advantage over Google’s device when it comes to connecting to home automation products. You can link Amazon’s gadget to a whole slew of smart home products, including not only popular ones like Google’s Nest thermostats and Philips Hue lightbulbs, but also more obscure devices like connected coffee pots, smart sprinkler controllers and smart meat thermometers. At least for now, by contrast, Home has a more limited set of products it can connect to or control. One thing to note about these add-on services: connecting them to your smart speaker can be tedious because you generally have to add them one by one. Additionally, in some cases, customizing your device may require you to dive deep into the settings of one of the apps. For some reason, Echo gave me restaurant recommendations based on my old work address, even though I linked it to my personal account and haven’t worked in that office for two years. Changing my Echo address to my home address required a Web search, because I couldn’t figure out on the Alexa app where to change that setting. You also may wonder why you might want or need a smart speaker, even if you are interested in stepping into the future. Much of what you can do with Echo or Home you can do already with a smartphone or computer using the intelligent assistants that are built into the iPhone, Android devices and the latest Windows PCs. At least when I got it to respond to me, Siri often handled my questions and requests just as well as Echo or Home. In some cases, it was better, such as when I asked it for restaurant recommendations. In addition to pointing me to the top restaurants, Siri went on to ask me if I wanted to call them or if I needed directions, something neither the Echo or Home did. In other cases, it was worse. Unlike with the Echo and Home, I couldn’t get Siri to play a particular station on Pandora. And there’s another thing to consider when it comes to Echo and Home, and that’s privacy. It’s that factor that’s dissuaded me from having one of these devices in my house in the past. Both devices work by listening for your voice at all times, something that just feels creepy. Both promise to keep only what you say immediately before and after your trigger word or phrase, but I worry about them listening in — even innocently — on my private conversations and moments. When it comes to privacy, Google in particular hasn’t always been upfront about its practices or even kept the promises it’s made to consumers; it’s been investigated by the FTC multiple times and had to pay a $22.5 million fine a few years ago. And both it and Amazon have an interest in collecting and keeping as much data as possible on their customers for marketing purposes. And both companies keep a record of all questions and requests users make through their smart speakers. So, as cool as I think it is to have an intelligent assistant only a catchphrase away, I’m not convinced yet that I need or want one. I hope that’s OK, Google. Subscribe to Home Delivery and SAVE!

Android Auto is said to be the extension to the Android OS allowing phones to take over the infotainment system of a car. (Photo: Pocketnow/YouTube Screenshot) The Android Auto platform recently received a few enhancements. However, the extension will only be allowed by law provided that it is used with a modern car with voice recognition. On that note, Android Auto is rumored to receive a fully hands-free "Okay, Google" voice activation in a few weeks. Advertisement The Android Auto is said to be the extension to the Android OS allowing phones to take over the infotainment system of a car. It is reportedly a simplified version of the Android which can be displayed on the central screen of a modern car. Google Maps may be accessed from there along with media streaming and Hangouts messages. The Android Auto is said to be compatible with apps like Spotify and Pandora, among others. It should be noted that there are currently over 200 models and 50 manufacturers that support this feature. Moreover, it also does not scratch the surface of all cars on the road, CNet reported. The Android Auto can also be set to auto-launch to connect with the car's Bluetooth. In addition, the latest update will run the interface directly on a handset. Moreover, all the voice recognition such as "Take me home", "Call Amanda", among others are also works too. Hence, voice recognition is necessary to avoid bumping against the law. Meanwhile, the Android Auto is said to be unrestricted to cars with compatible infotainment systems. Recently, Google's safety-minded software adds a car mode to handsets. The app is currently available on Google Play in the US. Advertisement Android Auto also comes with a dashboard mount. Third party apps which received updates with integration to the Auto include messaging apps like Kik, Skype and WhatsApp. Audio apps like Audible, NPR One, Overdrive and Stitcher are also included. An auto-reply feature may also be included with default messages like "I'm driving right now." The app will stay active until the Home button is pressed followed by a confirmation to exit. Download the app on Google Play.

That means the South Korean giant has had a leg up on its competitors with a large selection of apps, media content, and games available for the headset. But if there was one competitor to break through Samsung’s bubble and claim the top spot, it’s the company behind the most widely-used mobile operating system in the world — Google. Daydream is Google’s high-quality VR platform for Android. Like Samsung’s Gear VR, a phone must be compatible or, as Google says, “Daydream-ready,” to be able to utilize the platform. Headsets also must conform to Google’s reference design to be compatible — and that means we’ll see other unique headsets along the way from other manufacturers for Daydream as the platform grows. It sounds good, but VR headsets can be tricky, and can prove disappointing if the details don’t meet the original vision. Can Daydream deliver? Comfortable and compact One of the strongest points Daydream View has in its favor is the comfort of wearing it. Comfort is key in a device that’s expected to sit on your head for any amount of time, and Google has hit the mark with its design. Daydream View is a lightweight and small headset that’s made of “soft, breathable fabric.” It has a plastic interior, which holds the glass lens in place, and an elastic hinge at the top opens a flap that houses the wireless remote. This flap is also where you place your compatible Daydream-ready phone (right now, only Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones). Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends The headset is well-constructed, but the plastic in the interior feels a little cheap. We’ll have to wait and see how it weathers after prolonged usage, but we haven’t had issues so far. Thankfully, the inside padding can be removed so you can wash it and keep it clean. Daydream View has one strap that goes around the back of your head, and it’s easy to tighten or loosen with two buckles. Wearing the headset is comfortable, and because the device is light (it’s a little heavier than an average 5.5-inch phone) it didn’t make us weary after prolonged use. The View’s compact nature also makes it easy to carry around in a bag, and that’s important. The key differentiator of mobile VR is that you’re not restricted to using it in your home alongside a powerful desktop computer. You can use the headset on a train, in a hotel room, on your lunch break — just about anywhere. More: Google Pixel review But the headset does have one caveat, and it all depends on the shape of your face. With the headset on, there are three noticeable gaps that allow light to seep in from the outside — where the nose is and on the left and right edges. This won’t affect everyone, but those who have the problem may find light leak a distraction when using the headset in a bright room. The phone powering Daydream You need a Pixel or a Pixel XL to use Daydream, but Google says it’s working with “device and component manufacturers across the Android ecosystem” to bring more phones into the fold. More Daydream-ready phones means more people are likely to use the VR platform. Right now, there are a few devices available or nearly available that support Daydream, including ZTE’s Axon 7, and Huawei’s newly-announced Mate 9 Pro. Both of these devices will need updates to Android 7.0 Nougat to be classified as “Daydream-ready,” though. You can use the headset on a train, in a hotel room, or on your lunch break. Until then, we’re left with the more than capable Pixel and Pixel XL. The XL is the more obvious choice thanks to its Quad HD screen. Tight, small patterns of pixels are visible, but the quality is top notch. Pixels are more spread out and noticeable on the regular Pixel’s 1080p resolution, but content quality doesn’t degrade — it just doesn’t look as sharp. With the regular Pixel, you can sometimes see the top and bottom edges of the display, and that can be very distracting. After a few minutes of usage, the phone gets warm. After about an hour of use, the phone gets incredibly hot in VR mode. It’s hard to notice when the phone is in the headset, but games get throttled and start performing poorly. Google told us there should be a warning if the phone gets too hot, but we haven’t seen it yet. Samsung’s Gear VR can reportedly have the same issue, though we did not experience it when we tested the Gear VR with a Samsung Note 5 smartphone. This limits the amount of time you can spend using Daydream View. Playing a game is more graphics-intensive and more battery-draining than watching a video or movie, and we haven’t had issues doing the latter for longer periods. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends The Pixel XL’s battery life understandably took a hit, as Daydream cranks up the brightness to the highest value. After about an hour of usage our Pixel XL went from 100 percent to 75 percent — and we had to take it out afterwards to let it cool down. But that’s par for the course with mobile VR. It’s of course the case that VR is demanding, and any demanding app sucks down the battery. This is likely to remain a downside to all mobile VR headsets for years to come. Google Daydream View Compared To Sony PlayStation VR 3Glasses D2 Vanguard Edition Oculus Rift HTC Vive Samsung Gear VR Homido The remote controlling Daydream Daydream View comes with a remote, and it acts like a blend between the Wiimote from Nintendo’s Wii console, and the controllers for the Vive. It’s smooth to the touch, like a pebble, and has an ergonomic feel in the hand. It comes with a wrist strap to make sure the controller doesn’t go flying from your palm. The large circular dimple at the top acts as the main button, and below is an action button for games and apps. The lowest button is the home button. There’s a rocker on the right side to control your phone’s volume. The remote is responsive and there isn’t a lot of latency. In the main Daydream home screen, it acts as a pointer, but the options for what it can turn into are limitless. A flashlight, a sword, a wand, paintbrush — the remote adds much-needed utility to the mobile VR space, which largely used glance gestures to trigger actions and for navigation. One remote can easily work with two phones, so if you’re sharing a Daydream View between two people with Daydream-ready phones, just pop your phone out, insert the other, and give the controller a few seconds to find and connect to it. More: Google Pixel XL review But there’s an issue we’ve noticed with the controller. It sometimes stops working. We assume it temporarily loses the Bluetooth connection, but it’s unclear what the cause is. Almost once in every session, the controller disappeared and stopped functioning for a few seconds. It doesn’t take long until it reappears and continues to work as normal. This can be frustrating when you’re in a game that requires constant action. We have reached out to Google about the issue. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends You also need to charge the remote, which is yes, yet another object you need to charge. Thankfully, the 220mAh battery offers plenty of juice — we have yet to have it die on us, and that’s after about 5 sessions each lasting from 30 minutes to an hour. There’s no charger in the box, but the remote has a USB Type-C port, which is the same port on Google’s Pixel smartphones. The good thing about Type-C is that if you are not near a power outlet, you can always have your phone charge the remote. Daydream software is simple, and that’s great All you need to do to launch Daydream is plop your phone into the fold. Sensors on the headset will push instructions to the phone to start your VR session. This simplicity is key to get people to continue using the platform. Once the headset is in place, Google offers up an interactive guide on how the remote works — how you can press and hold the home button to center your screen, for example. Once the guide is over, a Daydream tutorial launches that has you exploring the woods with a flashlight, picking up rocks to discover desert animals, playing fetch with an Arctic fox, slinging a coconut from a palm tree, and more. After the tutorial, the Daydream home screen appears. It’s set in a calm, low-poly forest. The home screen closely resembles the layout of apps on the Oculus Rift. You immediately see your most used or recently-used apps, and you can head to your library to see every Daydream app you have installed. The Play Store is available here as well, which means you don’t need to take off the headset to download an app or game — the VR experience is completely seamless. You can also browse the Daydream app when you’re not in VR mode. It suggests apps to try, but it’s more useful as a quick way to jump into a specific app in the library. Oddly, we saw suggestions for a few short clips and movies, like Google’s 360 Spotlight Story, Help, but we couldn’t find the video in VR mode. Success depends on content At launch, you’ll be able to install YouTube VR, Street View, Google Play Movies, Google Photos, Google Arts & Culture, Wonderglade, Mekorama VR, Star Chart VR, Hunters Gate, Wall Street Journal VR, CNN VR, The Guardian VR, Fantastic Beasts, and The Turning Forest. But there are plenty more to come by the end of December, including content from NYT VR, HBO Go, Netflix, Hulu VR, the NBA, and games like Gunjack 2: End of Shift, Danger Goat, and Need for Speed: No Limits VR. And content is key to Daydream’s success. There needs to be a constant stream of apps, games, videos and movies that give people a reason to come back to the platform. The remote adds much-needed utility to the mobile VR space. So far, our favorite apps are Street View, Google Arts & Culture, YouTube VR, and Mekorama VR. The latter is like a VR spin on Monument Valley, where you direct a character through puzzles to get to a destination. YouTube VR gave us the best quality 360-degree content we could find on Daydream, and it has a killer interface. Street View, like its non-VR counterpart, was fun to peruse through — it doesn’t make you feel like you’re quite there, but it comes close. Arts & Culture will leave an impression, because it’s like being in a museum where the exhibitions come to you, and you get a free audio guide. You can also zoom in to paintings and sculptures to see extra details, something you can’t do normally. Games like Hunters Gate show the potential for third-person games on Daydream. Similar to Torchlight 2, you move your character throughout a level defeating various enemies, while collecting loot. It can get repetitive, but there’s a multiplayer component we haven’t been able to test out yet. More: Hands on: Samsung Gear VR (2016) At launch, there’s enough content to satisfy your escape from reality for some time, but that’s also the problem. It’s easy to power through a lot of this content, and we have to wait and see if Google’s partners follow through with more apps and games as the year goes on. The sooner more Daydream-ready phones launch, the better for the platform as well. Google also has to make sure the platform isn’t saturated with bad VR. There were several videos, from the likes of Wall Street Journal VR and some YouTube VR content, that were shot with subpar equipment resulting in lower quality videos. That can put people off from revisiting these apps, and provides less of a reason to revisit Daydream itself. Availability and price Google’s Daydream View and controller costs $80. It’s available now on the Google Store as well as from Verizon and Best Buy. The only color available now is “slate,” but in December you’ll be able to grab the headset in crimson and snow. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends While Daydream View is certainly affordable, it’s a device you’re using to access a platform. Much like buying a console, you’re going to have to continue spending money for content. There’s only a small amount that’s free — VR content is typically more expensive than the usual $1 apps, and games especially can often run between the $10 and $20 range. Warranty information Google offers a standard limited warranty for Daydream View, meaning if there are any manufacturer defects, the company will repair, replace, or refund the cost of your headset within one year of purchase. It does not cover accidental drops or normal wear and tear. Our take Daydream View is the best mobile virtual reality experience you can get right now, but of course, you’ll need a compatible phone. If you have a Pixel, or if your device becomes Daydream-ready via a software update, we believe the View is worth the $79. It’s a device solely for entertainment, and it delivers engaging and high-quality content. Is there a better alternative? Samsung’s 2016 Gear VR is the only other real competition in this space. It’s bulky, not as comfortable to wear and carry, and is limited to a handful of Samsung phones. Its content is similar in quality, but it has a larger library for you to choose from at the moment. While a little more expensive, the Gear VR is more mature, but Daydream does have an edge in comfort and affordability. How long will it last? The DT Accessory Pack Google Pixel Phone 32GB $990 Google Pixel XL Phone 128GB $1700 ZTE Axon 7 64GB unlocked Smartphone $405 Daydream is a new platform, so it’s unclear whether the Daydream View will achieve mainstream success like the company’s Chromecast streaming device. The headset itself is built well, so as long as you take care of it, you shouldn’t see any problems. It also doesn’t have any high-tech components inside (including the remote), and is mainly a shell for the software, so you shouldn’t need to upgrade it for some time. Should you buy it? Yes. Google’s Daydream View headset is a must-buy for those interested in VR and with a compatible phone. Its content is going to multiply as the year goes on, and we may see more exclusives like Fantastic Beasts. To be sure, Daydream is not perfect. The controller’s connection problems were a disappointment, and when used with the Pixel, heat over long-term use was an issue. However, the Gear VR doesn’t even have a controller, and it can suffer the same heat issues, depending on the phone it is used with. Daydream isn’t the revolution that was Samsung’s Gear VR, but it does bring improvements to the mobile headset space, and is superior to Gear VR in both comfort and accessibility. That makes it a great entry-level headset for anyone interested in VR.

And if your technological sense of direction isn’t quite as strong as you’d like it to be, it’s easy to get a bit, well, lost. But now, Google is here to help. In a blog post published last week, the internet giant announced that it had begun employing artificial intelligence to put Android apps into categories that, hopefully, make intuitive sense. “Every month, more than a billion users come to Google Play to download apps for their mobile devices. While some are looking for specific apps, like Snapchat, others come with only a broad notion of what they are interested in, like ‘horror games’ or ‘selfie apps,’” Google wrote in its blog post. “These broad searches by topic represent nearly half of the queries in Play Store, so it’s critical to find the most relevant apps.” So to help you find the most relevant apps,  Google “trained a neural network to learn how language was used to describe apps.” This, the search engine says, ought to make it easier for folks to find relevant apps, even if they don’t know exactly what they’re looking for. More: ‘StarCraft II’ will soon be used as training grounds for artificial intelligence “We built a Skip-gram model, where the neural network attempts to predict the words around a given word, for example ‘share’ given ‘photo,'” the company explained. So ostensibly, if you look for “selfie,” you’ll be greeted with apps like Snapchat or Instagram. While Google notes that employing artificial intelligence has certainly helped to provide better results to users, the team is continuously exploring a range of methods to constantly improve the system. And soon, the company hopes to “personalize the app discovery experience for users.” So although there’s not yet your own customized map for navigating the Google Play Store, this might just be the closest thing to it … for now.

Gothamist is a website about New York View Pretty | Blog Arts & Entertainment Food News Popular Advertising Contact Newsletter RSS Feed Staff Our Cities Chicago London Los Angeles New York City San Francisco Shanghai Toronto Washington DC Now There's A Way To Volunteer To Escort LGBTQ, POC And Muslims Who Feel Unsafe On Their Commutes by David Colon in News on Nov 12, 2016 11:00 am There's a way to make people feel this now. (Scott Lynch / Gothamist) While there are policy debacles yet to come under a Trump presidency, those are still somewhat in the future. An immediate consequence of Trump's election has been an emboldening of America's more hateful citizens, who are making themselves heard around the country, including in New York. Now though, the Arab Association of New York's Kayla Santosuosso is trying to help push back against that wave of hate, with an effort that will allow people to volunteer to escort "people of color, LGBTQ folks, and Muslims" on their subway commutes in order to keep them safe from harassment. Santosuosso's Google Form asks for your name, the best time you can help someone with their commute, where your commute takes you to and from and a little information about yourself. She told Gothamist that the initial idea for the form came after she got a Facebook message from a friend of a friend. That person had reached out to Santosuosso to see if she could help find someone who would ride downtown with a Muslim woman in Harlem who had been harassed on the subway two days in a row following the election. Santosuosso managed to connect the woman with someone who drives in from White Plains to Chelsea and volunteered to pick her up every day, but in the mean time, her Facebook post asking for help had been shared a number of times even outside of her normal friend network. Seeing the response, Santosuosso said she created the Google Form at 12:30 in the morning yesterday. "In the back of my head, I thought I'd make this Google Form and at the very least we’ll have this list of 50 people that I can connect in my own time," Santosuosso said. She had 50 people when she woke up, but then after spending a few hours in meetings yesterday, Santosuosso said the number of responses had shot up to 2,232, and were still coming in "every five to ten seconds." "Clearly there are signs of hope coming out of this," Santosuosso said. "This is showing that there’s a ton of energy and a ton of drive for folks to show up in the wake of this election and support their neighbors, especially those that are more vulnerable. People have asked what they do now, how to make themselves useful, and this is resonating because it’s one simple act that lets them help someone and get them home safely." Santosuosso also said that as the sign up sheet got more attention, she heard from people in other cities and states, places as far away as California, New Orleans and Boston. With the attention from those other cities in mind, and knowing that there are people who want to help in some small way but don't commute on the subway, Santosuosso said that she's currently talking with other organizing groups on how to best put people's energy to work. "Clearly there’s 2200 people willing to put their bodies on the line, so how do we harness it effectively?" she said. "We’re in the first couple days, but we’ve got 4 to 8 years ahead of us," she said. "So I'm trying to figure out how to keep the response from dying out." And even after Trump, America will still be dealing with this new reality. "The danger isn’t just Trump, it’s Trumpism, and the people who’ve been emboldened by him," Santosuosso said. The plan going forward is to put together and then send what Santosuosso called a toolkit to people that will show them organizations that need donations, volunteers and supplies, and try to connect people's skills with groups that need their specific help. Santosuosso said that because of the huge amount of people who signed up, she's not going to immediately start matching people up for escorts. Not until she's "come up with an effective way to provide training." She said that she's been talking with national anti-racist and de-escalation organizers, and that "knowing the urgency going forward we’ll harness people's energy quickly." In the mean time, if you do see someone being harassed on the subway, Santosuosso said that there are small steps you can take to help someone. "If you see someone you think is being harassed, go over,ask them if they’re okay and need help. If they’re non-responsive, just walk away but keep an eye on the situation. If you see they need help, talk to the person doing the harassment, ask them a bunch of questions, like what their name is and where they're from. Tear the focus away from the harassed person, and disrupt and deescalate the situation." She also suggested taking a deescalation class from a group like Showing Up For Racial Justice.

Starting this week, websites that keep violating Google's Safe Browsing standard will be slapped with a "Repeat Offender" tag. Google's Chrome browser and other popular browsers will display a notice to users who visit such sites warning them about the potential for their computers to become infected with unwanted software, malware, phishing and other security threats. The warning will remain in place for a minimum of one month and will only be removed after that period if Google determines the site no longer poses a security threat to users. The owner of a website classified as a Repeat Offender will not have an opportunity to get Google to reconsider the labeling for one full month, even if all identified security issues have been addressed before then. The new policy is designed to punish website owners whom Google considers to be frequent abusers of its Safe Browsing requirements. Google introduced Safe Browsing about nine years ago as a way to protect users from malicious websites. It basically serves as an alerting mechanism when users arrive on a website that Google's web crawlers determine is being used to serve up unwanted ads, software, spam and malware or is being used for phishing and other social engineering purposes. Till last December, Safe Browsing alerts were available only to desktop users. But since then, Google has enabled it by default for versions of Chrome running on its Android operating system. Google has used the Safe Browsing mechanism to also warn website owners and administrators about their sites being flagged for potential security issues. In many cases, the warnings have alerted administrators about potential security issues on their sites, which even they had not been aware of up to that point. Google's policy till this week has been to keep the browser warnings in place till the website owner remediates the issue. Once fixed, webmasters could ask Google to review the site once again and remove the browser warnings. Google also uses an automatic verification process under which it reviews flagged sites on its own and removes the alerts if it determines all violations have been addressed. "However, over time, we've observed that a small number of websites will cease harming users for long enough to have the warnings removed, and will then revert to harmful activity," said Brooke Heinichen, a member of Google's Safe Browsing team in a blog post this week. The tougher Safe Browsing policy that Google announced this week is a response to this loophole, Heinichen said. For classification purposes, Repeat Offenders are websites that frequently keep switching between compliant and non-compliant behavior with the sole purpose of gaming the system according to Heinichen. A website that is hacked and is being used for malicious purposes will not be classified as a repeat offender. That tag is reserved solely for sites that deliberately host harmful content. Heinichen did not say how Google will make that determination or what factors it will consider to determine if a site serving up malware is compromised or was set up solely for that purpose.           LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   Microsoft Outlook Customer Manager Helps SMBs Track Tasks, Contacts Facebook Unveils Messenger Group Chat in Canada, Australia How the Internet Came of Age as a Campaign Tool in 2016 Election Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards YouTube Now Providing Support for High-Definition Video                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

While this is the official one from Google, there are quite a lot of bugs that users are facing on regular basis, while installing apps or while updating them. One of the common issue / error is the Play Store Error 941 that shows up while you are trying to update an installed app. There are some users who also reported of this error when installing an app as well but it mostly happens during the app update on the Play Store. Most of the older Android OS versions seem to be showing this error, but there is no known reason for the same. Let’s check out how to fix the Error 941 on the Google Play Store. Clear Data and Cache of the Play Store App Clearing the cache and data of the app solves most of the issue. For this, go to Settings > Apps > and in the apps search for Google Play Store. Now, for this particular app settings, you will see both the options – Clear Cache and Clear Data. This might log you off your account sometimes and you will have to login back to your Google account, but if that is solving your issue of Error 941, that is fine. In the Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS, to find these options, you will need to go to “Storage” option in the app settings and there, you will find the buttons to clear the cache and data. Repeat the same for Google Play Services This is required only if deleting the data and cache for Google Play Store is not sufficient and app update is still throwing the same Error 941. There will be an app called Google Play Services, which you have to repeat the process for. With these two, the issue should be already fixed. If not, you can try to fix (note that we are telling to try because there is no fixed solution for any of the Play Store errors) that were helpful to others. Delete your Google account and add it back This is another way that has worked for users. Going to Settings > Accounts > Google and deleting your Google account and adding it back will help because sometimes your Google account is set to cache the error and keep throwing the same whenever you try installing or updating the app. Install remotely from Google Play website Some have reported that it has to do with the Play Store app and not the app you are downloading or the server. Google Play allows you to install apps remotely by opening the app details page on Play.google.com and selecting the device where to install the app. This has worked with everyone and it helps install the app but it isn’t the best solution always. Did it help? Or you tried some other way that might have helped? Do let us know in the comments below.

While tethered VR systems like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift require expensive headsets and even more expensive gaming PCs, mobile VR requires just a cheap addition to something most people already have: a smartphone. We’ve already seen several solutions for mobile VR, most notably Samsung’s Gear VR, which only works with high-end Samsung devices; and Google Cardboard, which is a cheap and limited option available to anyone. But Google is taking things to the next level with Daydream: a new virtual reality ecosystem for Android and the most compelling case for accessible VR I’ve seen to date. I’ve spent the last few days with Daydream and Google’s corresponding headset, the Daydream View, to check out the ecosystem ahead of its launch. In short, it’s very impressive, and those with a supported smartphone should strongly consider purchasing the $79 Daydream View headset when they go on sale today. Let’s get some of the basics out of the way. Daydream is virtual reality platform announced at Google I/O 2016 that consists of several APIs and a launcher application. Support for Daydream is built into Android 7.1, however you’ll need a “Daydream-Ready” device to access the ecosystem. Due to specific software and hardware requirements for Daydream, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are the only phones that currently support the platform, although you can expect to see many more compatible devices hit the market in coming months. It’s worth mentioning two additional things here. Daydream won’t be available on older devices due to stringent hardware requirements, including low-latency displays and current-generation processors (such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821). Daydream will also require a high-end smartphone, so don’t expect to see budget products that are “Daydream-Ready”. For now, if you want to use Daydream you’ll need to purchase a Daydream View headset, which is a pretty great piece of hardware. Built from plastic but mostly covered with a layer of soft fabric, the Daydream View feels excellent and looks quite nice. It’s lighter and much smaller than the Gear VR, which makes it more portable, and the single-band head strap is far less complicated. To use the Daydream View, all you need to do is insert a Pixel or Pixel XL into the holder, which opens like an airplane tray table when you release the elastic strap that holds it closed. The entire set-up process is much easier than the Gear VR as there are no awkward holding clasps and no plugs to attach; the Pixel instead recognizes the Daydream View through NFC and automatically launches the Daydream app when you insert it into the headset. The controller is the reason Daydream is so much more compelling than Gear VR or any other mobile VR solution I’ve tried. It’s genuinely a game changer. While it can be somewhat fiddly to position the Daydream View in the optimum spot, the headset is extremely comfortable to wear. Copious amounts of soft foam provide plenty of comfort, and the large nose hole will be perfect for most people. I found it much more comfortable than the Gear VR, which has a more rigid body with less foam, and I had no issues with sweat or fatigue after a lengthy VR session. The one downside to the Daydream View is that it leaks too much light from the sides of the headset in comparison to the Gear VR, which can introduce the occasional lens flare in a brightly lit room. The Gear VR also has a marginally larger field of view, which assists with immersion. By far the best aspect of the entire Daydream package is the controller. The plastic design looks basic from the outside, but on the inside there’s a collection of sensors that allows the controller to act like a motion-tracked wand. The interface of Daydream has you aiming the controller like a laser pointer to select items, and for something that doesn’t rely on external cameras or tracking devices, the whole system works much more seamlessly than I expected. These motion controls are combined with a trackpad and three buttons – select, menu, and home – to form the basis of Daydream’s control system. It’s easy to use, intuitive, and just damn awesome. Navigation feels far, far more natural than the awkward headset-mounted control pad on the Gear VR, and natural interface systems are always the easiest to use. With Daydream, all you need to do is point and click for the most part. The controller is a key aspect of most Daydream VR applications, and facilitates a whole range of interactivity and gameplay options. In one game I tried, the controller is used to point at targets you want to shoot, while the trackpad is used to move the playable character around the scene. In another game, I used the controller as a golf club for a round of mini-golf. In Google Street View, you use the controller like a laser pointer to designate where you want to move. All of these control systems were easy to grasp and fluid to use. Google has also designed the three buttons in such a way that you can easily find them by touch only, as you can’t see the controller itself in the world of VR. The home button is concave, while the menu button features a raised ridge, and this is enough to distinguish what you’re pressing without much effort. The controller is the reason Daydream is so much more compelling than Gear VR or any other mobile VR solution I’ve tried. It’s genuinely a game changer. To be clear, the single controller that comes with Daydream VR is not as versatile as the controllers you get with the Vive or Rift. It’s an effective and accurate pointer, but it lacks spatial recognition, so you can’t use it to reach out and grab an in-world item, for example. However, for a portable VR system that requires basically no setup, the control system is versatile and just makes sense. As Daydream VR is powered by a smartphone, it’s worth discussing how it performs. Throughout the apps and games I tested, I ran into surprisingly few issues with frame rate and movement tracking. For the most part, the Pixel XL maintained a high frame rate and tracked my head with near-perfect precision, which led to a motion-sickness-free experience. In comparison, the Gear VR with a Galaxy S6 performs well, however tracking seemed to stutter at times on Samsung’s solution where it didn’t in Daydream. I was also able to use Daydream on the Pixel XL for longer than I could on the Gear VR. Samsung’s smartphones tend to throttle significantly after 10 minutes of heavy graphics workloads, whereas the Pixel XL can sustain its performance for longer. The phone does get very hot in the headset during operation, but it takes 30 to 40 minutes of heavy gaming before slowdowns begin to appear. In an ideal world, Daydream devices wouldn’t slow down at all, even during lengthy periods of use. However, it’s hard to develop a high-end product that can sustain top-end performance for hours without running into thermal limits, and I’m quite content with the amount of time you can use Daydream in one sitting. I expect this to improve over time as well, as companies develop new hardware solutions to tackle throttling in VR environments. The most lacklustre aspect to Daydream is the collection of content at launch. There are only 10 apps available today, although Google promises a wide variety of content (another 41 apps) will be available before the end of the year. I’ve tried all the apps available at launch, and while most are polished and well made, I feel as though the best stuff is yet to be released. The best app I’ve tried on Daydream was Star Chart VR, a $4.99 app that lets you explore the planets and moons in our solar system. I’m a big sucker for astronomy and space exploration, and the experience of floating around in space while zooming billions of kilometres to different planets was a lot of fun. The app gives a great sense of just how vast our solar system is, and it’s packed with loads of information not just on planets, but stars and constellations. This is Wonderglade, a Daydream launch title I enjoyed playing Wonderglade (free with in-app purchases) briefly, which is a fun park game designed for children. The set of min-games within Wonderglade make great use of the controller, but the depth of content is limited. Mekorama ($3.99) is another game I played briefly that uses clever 3D puzzle mechanics, but it's probably not something I’d play for hours in Daydream when it works well as a standard mobile game. Rounding out the collection of launch games is Hunters Gate ($5.99), which is another that makes great use of the controller. However, the actual game itself felt shallow and repetitive after an hour or so of gameplay, and while its decent graphics gives me hope for other mobile-powered VR games, I probably wouldn’t recommend it. This is VR Karts, which is not available at launch The Wall Street Journal app includes a compelling stock visualization tool, but I’m not sure who would use Daydream to view stocks or read the news. The Google Arts & Culture app has plenty of artworks and content from museums, though it’s another app that doesn’t add much by being in VR. The best two VR apps designed by Google are YouTube and Street View, as they’re packed with content and work well with some Daydream-specific enhancements. What I’m more excited about are upcoming apps like the Fantastic Beasts experience, LEGO Mekorama, VR Karts, Need for Speed: No Limits VR, Netflix and more, which are all set for launch later this year. From what I’ve seen in preview videos, those apps could seriously bring the Daydream platform to life. Finally, I was impressed with Google’s Daydream launcher application, which is simple to navigate and provides quick access to content through the remote. The integrated Play Store is easy to use, although it might require some discoverability tweaks as more content is added. The tutorial section is fantastic as well, and guides you through all the basics of Daydream with plenty of interactivity. After a few days with Daydream, it’s clear that Google has put a lot of work into creating the most compelling Android VR solution. The controller is amazing and the Daydream View headset is comfortable and affordable. While the selection of content isn’t fantastic right now, there’s plenty of stuff to look forward to, and it won’t be long before Gear VR and other competitors fade into the distance. 13 comments 208 interactions Back to TechSpot Main Sections Technology News Reviews Features Product Finder Downloads Drivers Community TechSpot Forums Today's Posts Ask a Question News & Comments Useful Resources Best of the Best Must Reads Trending Now Hot Downloads About TechSpot About Advertising News Archive Social & Feeds Follow TechSpot Facebook Twitter Google Plus YouTube RSS Subscribe to the TechSpot Newsletter © 2016 TechSpot, Inc.

Someone from Google has indirectly confirmed that it's slated for a future release, possibly once the official Android 7.1 build rolls out.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google's been accused of giving its previous flagships, the Nexus 5X and 6P, less attention that the pair deserves, now that the company's focus is beelining full speed ahead in the direction of its self-branded premium smartphones, the Google Pixel and XL. Google recently pulled the Nexus 5X and 6P from its online store to provide some ample vacancy for its new phones. To add insult to injury, several features included in its Android Nougat operating system were absent in the Nougat update for the Nexus 5X and 6P, which was a letdown for users who fancy night mode and even fingerprint gestures found on the Pixel phones. Will Night Mode Return To The Nexus 5X And Nexus 6P? According to Google, it wasn't able to carry over the night Mode feature for the Nexus 5X and 6P because it requires a driver support not present on the devices. Despite this, users still clamored for night mode. During the beta test for Nougat, many of them submitted this omission as a bug, saying that night mode is nowhere to be found in the settings menu. Now, it seems that Google is pushing back. Someone from Google, most likely a moderator or employee that handles firmware issues, has labeled the night mode bug as "closed," with a "FutureRelease" status. This might be indicative the the night mode feature will return to the Nexus 5X and 6P, perhaps via a software update. Whether or not it's true that the night mode requires a different driver to work, the upset has likely caused Google to avoid disappointing owners of the Nexus 5X and 6P. Why Some Nougat Feautres Are't Present On The Nexus 5X And 6P It's highly possible that the night mode feature wasn't carried over to avoid confusion with a virtually similar feature on Pixel phones called "Night Light." It doesn't seem like a major semantic disruption if you think about it, although they may have been also signaling that the best, full-fledged Nougat experience can only be found on the Pixel phones, and that other smartphones will have, by some measure, a reduced and inferior build. Is it a marketing tactic? We can't say for sure, but it's good to know that the feature will potentially return. We'll find out if it does once Android 7.1 officially arrives on the Nexus 5X and 6P. Meanwhile, don't hold your breath for this once since Google might not bring it over at all. For the uninitiated, the night mode feature dims the screen with a red tint during certain times of the day, particularly at evening, to reduce blue light, which has been proven to disrupt healthy sleeping patterns upon prolonged exposure.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 12, 2016 at 10:11AM If you have $10,000 to invest, most financial advisors will probably tell you to put the cash in an index fund which tracks the overall market. That's because it's considered too risky to put all your savings in a single stock, but buying three to five stocks might not create a well-diversified portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. But if you have $10,000 that you can afford to lose, you might consider investing in a few riskier, high-growth plays which could crush the S&P 500 over the long run. Let's look at three tech stocks that turned $10,000 into $200,000 or more in just over a decade -- Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Alphabet Alphabet, the company formerly known as Google, went public in 2004 for $85 per share. Your $10,000 would have been enough to buy 117 shares. The company then did a share spin-off in 2014 that had a similar impact as a 2-for-1 split. You would then have 117 shares of Google's Class A (voting) stock and 117 shares of the new Class C (non-voting) shares. At today's prices, those 234 shares of Class A and C shares would be worth about $182,000. When both classes hit historic highs in late October, your investment would have been worth about $193,000. Staying invested in Google required confidence in its ability to evolve from a high-growth search engine with a triple-digit P/E ratio into a diversified tech giant. It gradually accomplished this by expanding its ecosystem with Maps, YouTube, Drive, Chrome, Android, and other platforms. By offering those cloud-based apps, services, and operating systems for free, Google created the perfect funnel to gather customer data for its targeted ads. That move turned Google into the 800-pound gorilla of internet ads. Western Digital Hard-drive maker Western Digital, which went public in 1978, generally isn't known as a high-growth stock. But if you had spent $10,000 to buy 4,098 shares of WD in December 2000 during the nadir of the dot-com crash, you would be sitting on over $235,000 today. Moreover, your investment would be paying you nearly $8,200 in dividends every year. Image source: Pixabay. Western Digital bounced back from the dot-com crash because it was the still the market leader in hard disk drives (HDDs), and the growth of the PC market and expansion of data centers ensured that orders would keep coming in. But in recent years, the HDD market was hit hard by a slowdown in PC sales, weaker enterprise spending, and the rise of flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs). SSDs are pricier, but they're faster, smaller, more power-efficient, and less prone to damage than HDDs. This makes them a much more popular choice for high-end tablets, 2-in-1 devices, and ultrabooks. To stay relevant, WD acquired flash memory and SSD maker SanDisk earlier this year in a $16 billion deal. WD's 55% rebound over the past six months suggests that investors believe that warming PC sales and the SanDisk acquisition could breathe fresh life into this aging tech giant. Salesforce Salesforce, the market leader in cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) solutions, went public in 2004 for $11 per share. Your $10,000 would have been enough to buy 909 shares. After undergoing a 4-for-1 split in 2013, those 3,636 shares would be worth over $275,000 today. Salesforce built its entire business on CRM solutions that were easily scalable as subscription-based cloud services. Its first-mover's advantage in that market helped it claim 19.7% of the global CRM market in 2015, according to Gartner. That put it well ahead of rivals such as SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, and Adobe. Salesforce also posted the highest year-over-year market share gain of those five market leaders. Salesforce has a strong record of double-digit sales growth, but its bottom line growth is weaker. The company is consistently profitable on a non-GAAP basis, but its GAAP earnings only occasionally stay in the black on a quarterly basis. Looking ahead, Salesforce also faces tough questions about its high valuations (234 times earnings and 7 times sales), as well as new CRM challenges presented by Microsoft's purchase of LinkedIn. The key takeaway Investing in Alphabet, Western Digital, and Salesforce at the right time took a lot of guts, patience, and luck. While it should be very tough to find the next stock that could turn $10,000 into over $200,000, investors should keep an eye out for promising plays that could generate massive returns in just one or two decades.

Bloomberg photo by Nikki Ekstein   Nikki Ekstein Bloomberg     Let me begin by saying this: I'm not a professional photographer. I have a slightly better-than-101 understanding of how cameras work and why things such as sensor size and f-stops matter. Looking at tech specs is far from my idea of an engaging read. As a travel editor, I do love taking pictures, though. And I take tons of them-thousands and thousands on any given trip, almost entirely on smartphones. For years, I've been so dependent on mobile photography that I've committed to carrying around two phones-one, an Android, that's easier to type on, and the other, an iPhone, that has stronger apps and a killer camera. For the last few weeks, I carried three: Google's Pixel, the iPhone 7 Plus, and the Moto Z, the latest entrants to the mobile photography race. (The Moto has flown largely under the radar, but its key selling point is its compatibility with magnetic "mods" that include a portable speaker and an attachable Hasselblad 4116 True Zoom camera.) We truly are living in the first true golden era of smartphone photography. Which is best? That answer is a bit complicated. But after five head-to-head layman's tests, where I focused on experience and results (and not hardware specs), I'd be happy with any of them. I'm probably a lot like you when it comes to my smartphone camera: All I want is for it to take good pictures, quickly, clearly, and without much effort. If I wanted a real camera, I'd get one of these new mirrorless, DSLR, and rugged models. But with my phone, as long as I can compose a decent shot whenever there's a great subject in view, and whatever the given situation is, I'd like to think my phone can meet me the rest of the way. Here's how each performed against key selling points. All you have to do is determine your top priorities before your next upgrade. If You Need ... Auto-Focus The idea of never missing a shot is what really drives mobile photography; it's why every phone has shortcuts for opening the camera app. But that quick-draw image is no good unless it's in focus. My auto-focus tests were conducted both in daylight and at dusk, with both fast-moving and still subjects. Winner: The iPhone 7 Plus won for crispest images across the board. Even when I was snapping from the window of a moving car, it managed to deliver beautifully defined shots of the Manhattan skyline-one frame after the next. (Very Close) Runners-up: The Pixel more or less flopped from the moving car window, but take out the fast-moving subject, and man, does that phone shine. In both daylight and low light, the auto-focus performed faster than those of its competitors, never taking more than a second to go from blur to fab. The Moto Z fell in between. Two out of three frames on the Manhattan bridge came out clearly; everywhere else, I really appreciated the fact that the Hasselblad attachment lets you trigger its autofocus with a halfway press of the shutter button, just as on a real camera. It's way easier than repeatedly touching the screen and makes one-handed shooting a breeze.   Jack-o'-lantern sculptures shot with the iPhone 7 Plus, from left, Google Pixel and Moto Z. - Bloomberg photo by Nikki Ekstein If You Need ... Low Light Handling Luckily for the purposes of my experiment, I was able to head to the Great Jack O'Lantern Blaze, a spooky pumpkin festival in the Hudson Valley, ahead of the Halloween weekend, with all three phones in tow. Winner: The Pixel-no contest. It did a commanding job of focusing quickly in low light and offering warm (but accurate) color balance. It had a stronger dynamic range, by far, which is what kept the red foliage in check in the background. You'll also be thankful for these features in dimly lit restaurants. Runners-up: While the MotoZ offered color that felt truer to life, the iPhone7 offered a sharper low-light image.   Architectural details shot with the zoom on a iPhone 7 Plus, from left, Google Pixel, and Moto7. - Bloomberg photo by Nikki Ekstein If You Need ... a Powerful Zoom Usually, if I need a great zoom, I'm not relying on my smartphone. But that's starting to change. Both the MotoZ (with its Hasselblad attachment) and the iPhone 7 Plus have a 10x zoom capability, whereas the Pixel is limited to 4x. Winner: MotoZ, which I was able to use it to get a crisp shot of the third-floor lettering on the side of an Upper East Side Synagogue from across the street. That's because the attachable camera has a proper optical zoom lens that you won't find on any other phone camera-not just a digital zoom that works by tightening the crop of your shot. The difference here was palpable. Runner-up: The iPhone still has an exceptional zoom capacity-even if its 10x range is purely digital. But pushing it to the edge means you're likely to get a blurry shot. That's still better than the Pixel, whose zoom fell flat by comparison.   The writer shot portraits of Riley, her Bernese Mountain Dog, with the iPhone 7 Plus, from left, Google Pixel, and Moto Z. - Bloomberg photo by Nikki Ekstein If You Need ... Great Portraits Pets and babies: They're two of the most common subjects for smartphone photographers. So even if you're not getting beautiful street style portraits, this is a feature that you'll use on the regular. Winner: The iPhone 7 Plus has a portrait mode is designed to deliver flattering depth of field. (Read: Your background is softened while your subject is in clear view.) The result is really as beautiful as they make it sound. Getting there requires a little legwork, but thankfully, the phone will coach you through it: It tells you if you need more light or more distance from your subject. Sometimes you're straight out of luck. But when it works, it really works wonders. Runners-up: Even though the MotoZ has two dedicated portrait modes (one for night portraits and the other to correct backlighting), I struggled to capture my dog's eyes or to get fully focused shots of her face. The Pixel, meanwhile, has no fancy portrait mode. But remember that excellent auto-correct? It helps deliver lovely portrait shots in a pinch.   Rugelach photographed in macro mode by the iPhone 7 Plus, from left, Google Pixel, and Moto Z. - Bloomberg photo by Nikki Ekstein If You Need ... Macro Mode Please forgive me: I took a bit of one cookie before I found my favorite composition. (It was delicious and fresh out of the oven.) Winner(s): The MotoZ, maybe, by a hair. The three images are almost identical. That's why I conducted a follow-up test, shooting the backside of a coin. I got the tightest shot with the MotoZ, with the iPhone a close second place. The Pixel struggled. Good thing nobody needs photos of a penny, anyway.

The hack successfully targeted Google's shiny new Pixel handset, won the group a $120,000 cash prize and opened-up a lot of patching work for Google. Both the regular and XL versions of the smartphone appear to be susceptible to the attack that utilizes what is know as a zero-day vulnerability. What that essentially means is a hole in the device's security, that was present on the initial software the units shipped with. And to our knowledge, no subsequent patches have remedied the issue, yet. As for the severity of the hack, we have to say it is pretty high up there. What the hackers demonstrated on stage is known as remote code execution. In this particular case, the attack appeared to be triggered by receiving a special message. Through it, the Pixel then proceeded to open the Google Play Store and Google Chrome. The latter displayed a message that read "Pwned by 360 Alpha Team". This was quite aptly put, since the video demonstrated clearly that on the attacker's side, there was access to the phone's full list of permissions, thanks to a background, rogue app install. That practically leaves all of your data, including multimedia, contacts and even communication channels open to whatever form of exploitation the attacker sees fit. Scary, indeed. The good news here is that, as already mentioned, Qihoo 360 is a group of white-hat hackers, who make their money selling information for these kinds of vulnerabilities to the responsible parties, in this case Google. That, theoretically means that the online titan should have enough time to figure out how to patch the holes in peace, without details of the vulnerability falling into the wrong hands. It is also curious to note that Qihoo 360 cached-in a total of $520,000 at the event, after demonstrating another vulnerability in Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 and one in Adobe Flash.

When Google Home works, it is nothing short of delightful. It just doesn't always work. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Google has said that the promise of Google Home -- its smart voice-activated speaker -- is that I won't have to break my stride to find a light switch, change the channel, search for music or type something into a search bar again. But the $129 Google Home, which the company sent for me to review last week, stops short of that vision right now. Don't get me wrong: when Google Home works, it is nothing short of delightful. It just doesn't always work. Overall, I had no problems with setup and very few problems getting Google to understand me. Even having lived with the Amazon Echo for months -- and therefore being pretty used to controlling things with my voice -- there were still some great things that Google Home offered that stood out. The best of these was integration with the Chromecast, Google's streaming device. Being able to search for YouTube videos and have them play on my television without having to lift a finger was great -- especially while doing chores that required both my hands. (Ironing can be the worst, right?) It's a little convenience, but one that is very welcome. Being able to pause and resume my videos with Google Home felt a little bit like magic, especially since the user interface on my phone for Chromecast doesn't always obey my commands. Another neat feature was being able to listen to podcasts on-command, even if I hadn't subscribed to them. It was a nice way to try something new without having to pull out my phone, do some searching and hook it up to the speaker. Yet the wins for Google Home, in some ways, just set high expectations for other commands that it didn't meet. Some were small. One unexpected downside: saying "OK Google" into my living room also activated the voice assistant on my Android phone, leading to an occasional, unintentional chorus. Also, when I had the music on a little too loud, as with Amazon's Alexa, Google Home couldn't quite hear me -- but that could easily be taken as a compliment to Google's speakers rather than an insult to its microphones. Other issues were much bigger. Empowered by my first brush with success with podcasts, for example, I asked for a specific episode of a podcast I had missed: no dice. When dealing with the Chromecast, I got bold and asked it to work with third-party apps that also work with Google's streaming stick -- a feature that hasn't been added yet. Feeling out the edges of Google Home's current capabilities was frustrating. While I have no doubt that Google will add more services constantly -- it will have to if it wants to keep up its arms race with Echo's capabilities -- it will be a long training process for the both of us. And there were simply some services that I use that Google Home doesn't work with, such as iTunes. In fact, I couldn't hook up my iPhone's music to Google Home at all. Amazon's Echo can work as a Bluetooth speaker, meaning that even if Apple and Amazon never get along, my iPhone and my Echo still can. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) With the Google Home, I'm somewhat out of luck. That put something into sharper focus: if you want the most out of Google Home, you have to fall in line with the Google universe. That doesn't solely mean Google products, but it does mean only products with which Google has a good relationship. And that subtle steer to your purchasing decisions isn't one that should be ignored, regardless of your voice assistant of choice. Consumers won't have to choose their tech giant of choice quite yet, but in the future, you may buy your appliances and light bulbs based on which voice assistant you use. That day, though, is not today. And the truth is that it won't be tomorrow either -- for Google Home or Echo. These are both capable products right now, and people who want to play with these products, and who find experimentation fun, should buy one if they want it. In terms of recommendations, I'd say that Google Home is best for people who've already got a Chromecast and use Google services; those who don't may want to look at the Echo. But ultimately, the Google Home -- and any voice-controlled device -- is an investment in future technology. In fact, Google Home does a great job of pointing that out itself. Ask it for something it can't do, and it will tell you that it only can't do it "yet," leaving open the tantalizing possibility that someday it will do everything that I ask of it. Just not today.

Sections Search Help/Info Subscribe: Digital | Home Delivery Subscribe Help/Info     Breaking News Bar   Business posted: 11/12/2016 7:19 AM The tech battle brewing over interactive whiteboards Facebook Twitter 200 Google+ LinkedIn 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close   Google entered the niche but increasingly competitive market for interactive whiteboards with the debut of Jamboard. (MUST CREDIT: Courtesy of Google)   Steven Overly The Washington Post     The latest product to be unveiled by tech giant Google was not a new smartphone or wearable device or search feature designed to be used by millions of everyday consumers. Rather, it was a $6,000 whiteboard designed to be used in your office conference room. The release of Jamboard puts the Silicon Valley behemoth into the niche but increasingly competitive market of interactive whiteboards, the high-tech equivalent of those dry-erase boards that employees use to scrawl out diagrams, lead presentations or brainstorm new ideas. Microsoft and Google have both gotten into the interactive whiteboard market this year, creating new competition for the largest and most entrenched player, Smart Technologies, a Canadian firm recently acquired by Foxconn. "The last piece of equipment in the office and classroom that hasn't made it into the modern age is the whiteboard," said Smart Technologies chief technology officer Warren Barkley. "We, along with Microsoft and Google, see this as an opportunity to move that static, physically isolated content into the wider world." Though commonplace today, the standard whiteboard is an innovation itself. Popularized in the late 1980s and 1990s, the whiteboard has, in many instances, replaced the dusty blackboard that always left hands, clothes and floors coated in a thin layer of chalk residue. The digital whiteboard is a more modern invention and it continues to evolve. Smart Technologies takes credit for creating the first interactive whiteboard in 1991. Barkley said those devices were primarily large display devices that used projectors and had maybe one or two touch points. Today, interactive whiteboards come with high-tech LED touch screens whose ease of use more closely resembles a tablet computer. That evolution has come with fits and starts, he said, and new arrivals could advance it further. Google's Jamboard is a 55-inch, touch screen monitor that connects to the cloud and taps into Google's G Suite of productivity apps, including Google Drive, Docs and Calendar. Equipped with machine learning technology, the board is marketed as a tool for companies to make information gathering and brainstorming more seamless. As senior product manager T.J. Varghese said succinctly in a recent blog post, "At Google, we've set out to redefine meetings." Varghese wrote in an email that the company will first offer Jamboard to the roughly 2 million customers who subscribe to its workplace software, and it will review how those businesses put the board to use before selling it to other corporate customers. It's unclear whether Jamboard will have a meaningful impact on Google's income. It strikes a different tone from the company's other products, which are generally lower cost and marketed to the masses, because the electronic whiteboard is distinctly aimed at a business crowd with a hefty I.T. budget. Google also faces stiff competition in the workplace technology market, said Vanessa Thompson, a research analyst at IDC, a market research firm specializing in technology. In March, Microsoft began shipping its own interactive whiteboard, called Surface Hub. Much as Jamboard integrates with Google's other products, Surface Hub integrates with Microsoft's established slate of workplace software, including Skype and Microsoft Office. The 55-inch Surface Hub sells for $8,999, and the 84-inch version goes for $21,999. "At the very highest level, I would say almost every company today is going through some form of digital transformation," said Julia Atalla, senior director of Microsoft's Windows and Devices group. "Medium- to large-size businesses, they're looking at ways they can innovate faster." Interactive whiteboard purveyors say their products meet that need. Collaboration has become harder in office environments where some employees work remotely or travel often, and information is increasingly stored in digital formats and shared through email. Having a digital interface that all workers in a meeting can connect with to share information, video conference and otherwise engage makes those gatherings more productive, they say. But I.T. trends could also make the large capital investment needed to purchase the boards harder to justify, Thompson of IDC said. "There are some macro trends impacting the way we work, like decentralization in large organizations, small team-oriented work, personal productivity tools augmenting tools provided by organizations," Thompson said. "These behavioral themes mean that workers are just as likely to use personal tools to share and collaborate as they are a space in the office."

Read More , and I think it comes down to terminology. Google has never really been good on this front, and when you’re trying to wrap your head around terms like “cards”, “feed”, and “OK Google”, it’s easier to roll your eyes and give up. So, if Google Now confuses you, here’s everything you need to know to clear up that confusion — plus a few tips that’ll help you get started. This article was written with Android 5.1 Lollipop in mind. Most of it should still apply to any device running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean or later, though there may be slight differences. Understanding Google Now Cards Google Now can do many things — like change how you search for things 6 Google Now Features That Will Change How You Search 6 Google Now Features That Will Change How You Search You may already be using Google Now on your Android device, but are you getting all that you can out of it?

Here's to make the best of it! Read More — but the Cards feature exists to keep you on top of your busy life without any effort on your part. Or at least, that’s the goal. A card is basically a bite-sized piece of information that Google thinks you’ll want to know. Maybe it’s an alert, a notification, a news snippet, results from last night’s football game, an appointment reminder, a new restaurant in your town, or whatever else. Each thing is a “card” that gets added to your “feed”, and you can discard individual cards when you’re done with them with a simple swipe. Google provides a lot of its own cards, but over the past few years, over 100 third-party apps have been incorporated into the system. If you have one of these apps installed, you can enable Cards integration. (For example, with OpenTable you can pay for your bill directly 5 Helpful Apps for When You Can’t Decide Where to Eat 5 Helpful Apps for When You Can’t Decide Where to Eat Can't decide where to eat? Then you need at least one of these apps. Read More from your Feed.) For the most part, cards are generated dynamically based on all the data Google has on you. Appointment reminders are sourced from your calendar events, while news stories depend on your web browsing activity, and nearby alerts come from your location history. As such, to really benefit from Cards, you’ll need to grant Google permission to know more What Are Android Permissions and Why Should You Care? What Are Android Permissions and Why Should You Care?

Read More . “Google Now” is now known as “Google Assistant,” and any references to “Now” (such as “Now cards”) have been changed — so technically, the Cards feature is just called your “feed” now, but functionally, nothing has changed. How to Enable Google Now Cards Want to start using Cards? Great! Here’s what you have to do. Launch the Google app. Enable the Google Now feature. Tap the menu button at the top left. Select Settings. Select Your feed. Tap the option called Turn on the feed. Grant Google the necessary permissions. When prompted, tap Set Up. If prompted, select the Google account you want to use. When prompted, tap Yes, I’m In. Customize your Card preferences. Go back into Settings > Your feed. Scroll down to the Get notified about section. Enable/disable the cards according to your needs. If you ever want to stop using Cards, go back into Settings and disable the feed. It’s as simple as that. 3 Tips to Get the Most Out of Cards With Cards enabled, there are a handful of tips that will help you maximize your experience and results. Honestly, Cards can be pretty underwhelming at first, but once you get into the flow of it, you’ll wonder how you made it through your day without it. 1. Manually provide your interests. Open the menu in the Google app, and you’ll see an option called Customize. You really should fill this out as much as you can because it will make your cards more accurate — it won’t just add more cards to your feed but will also stop showing cards that may not fit in with your interests. For example, filling in the Transportation details will alert you when Google expects traffic. Filling in Sports details will prevent Google from showing you Dallas Cowboys news if you’re living in Texas but your team of choice is the Philadelphia Eagles. Stocks will alert you when your designated stocks rise or fall in value. Some sections, like TV & Movies, can’t have interests manually added, but it’s still a nice way to check what Google thinks you’re interested in, and you can remove the ones that have been wrongly added. 2. Prioritize the order in which cards show up. What if you want the Weather card to always appear at the top? Well, there’s no way to make that happen manually (again, all of this is handled dynamically by Google’s secret algorithms). However, the more you search for something and the more you interact with certain cards, Google will take that to mean greater interest on your part in those topics — and these cards will appear higher in your feed than others. So if you want Weather to come first, make sure you frequently ask Google about the weather! 3. Start using Google Now voice commands. Frankly, Google Now is more of a nuisance than an aid if you refuse to use voice commands. Plus, there’s so much more you can do through voice commands 8 Voice Tricks for Google Navigation That You Never Knew About 8 Voice Tricks for Google Navigation That You Never Knew About With "OK Google" enabled, you'll never have to touch Google Maps again.

For example, you can create reminders by going to the menu and selecting Reminders, and this is fine (check out our guide to using Google Now reminders 8 Amazing, Life-Improving Uses for Google Now Reminders 8 Amazing, Life-Improving Uses for Google Now Reminders Google Now has built-in reminders, but are you using them to their full extent?

Here's to make the best of it! Read More . And yes, these reminders will show up as cards. When the Google app is open, you can use voice searches and each search’s results will show up as a card. This works whether you’re searching for people, places, events, stock prices, trivia facts, current date/time, weather, navigation, etc. And when you’re done with a card, just swipe right to get rid of it. So easy, so clean, and so useful.

Analysts had predicted revenue of $20.8 billion for the second quarter of 2016. “All the trajectories look good,” said Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett. “They’re shifting more to mobile — they’re following the customers.” Profit for the quarter rose 26 percent year over year to hit $4.88 billion, topping analysts’ $4.5 billion forecast. Earnings per share also exceeded expectations, at $8.42, compared with analysts’ forecast of $8.03. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat attributed revenue growth to digital advertising delivered via smartphones. “The primary driver was the increase of mobile search by consumers benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the mobile search experience,” Porat said in a conference call. “We also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet search, as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising.” Revenue was also up compared with the first quarter of this year, by 6 percent. The usefulness on mobile devices of Google apps such as Maps, Gmail and Search underlies Alphabet’s rising income, said R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. “The fact that revenue growth accelerated quarter over quarter was a nice surprise,” Sebastian said. “Those utility functions on mobile offered by Google apps are very important, maybe not as sexy as the next major messaging app or social platform, but I think that’s what’s driving it. A lot of the Google apps tend to be very visible and are some of the most used apps on most smartphones.” Alphabet’s quarterly report also revealed the firm has added more than 9,000 workers over the past year, bringing the workforce up to 66,575. The company hired 2,460 workers in the quarter. Google itself took in $21.3 billion in revenue, up 21 percent year over year. The search giant also reported a 33 percent increase in non-advertising revenue, to $2.2 billion. Google apps and cloud services targeted at businesses have the highest potential to bring in cash to rival that from the firm’s digital advertising income, Gillett said. However, the company’s “Other Bets,” which encompass everything that’s not Google, such as smart-home company Nest and the Google X “moonshot” experiments lab, recorded an $859 million loss, with $185 million in revenue. In the second quarter of 2015, the Other Bets lost $660 million, with revenue of $74 million. Alphabet cut capital expenses 16 percent to $2.1 billion for the quarter. Porat, hired as chief financial officer in March 2015, has imposed “a more disciplined approach to spending,” Sebastian said. Alphabet did not provide numbers for the performance of YouTube, but both Porat and Google CEO Sundar Pichai described it as strong. Asked whether Google was capturing revenue with YouTube that would otherwise have gone to TV providers, Pichai said it was hard to tell, but that the streaming service fit well with the company’s focus on delivering content and services through smartphones. “Video is the killer format on mobile,” Pichai said. Alphabet’s quarterly performance sent its stock price up more than 4 percent Thursday in after-hours trading, to $797 from a close at $765.84.

Since its launch last year, it has been joined by several other AI-based academic search engines, most notably a relaunched effort from computing giant Microsoft. Semantic Scholar, from the non-profit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) in Seattle, Washington, unveiled its new format at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in San Diego. Some scientists who were given an early view of the site are impressed. “This is a game changer,” says Andrew Huberman, a neurobiologist at Stanford University, California. “It leads you through what is otherwise a pretty dense jungle of information.” The search engine first launched in November 2015, promising to sort and rank academic papers using a more sophisticated understanding of their content and context. The popular Google Scholarhas access to about 200 million documents and can scan articles that are behind paywalls, but it searches merely by keywords. By contrast, Semantic Scholar can, for example, assess which citations to a paper are most meaningful, and rank papers by how quickly citations are rising—a measure of how ‘hot’ they are. When first launched, Semantic Scholar was restricted to 3 million papers in the field of computer science. Thanks in part to a collaboration with AI2’s sister organization, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the site has now added millions more papers and new filters catering specifically for neurology and medicine; these filters enable searches based, for example, on which part of the brain part of the brain or cell type a paper investigates, which model organisms were studied and what methodologies were used. Next year, AI2 aims to index all of PubMed and expand to all the medical sciences, says chief executive Oren Etzioni. “The one I still use the most is Google Scholar,” says Jose Manuel Gómez-Pérez, who works on semantic searching for the software company Expert System in Madrid. “But there is a lot of potential here.” Microsoft’s revival Semantic Scholar is not the only AI-based search engine around, however. Computing giant Microsoft quietly released its own AI scholarly search tool, Microsoft Academic, to the public this May, replacing its predecessor, Microsoft Academic Search, which the company stopped adding to in 2012. Microsoft’s academic search algorithms and data are available for researchers through an application programming interface (API) and the Open Academic Society, a partnership between Microsoft Research, AI2 and others. “The more people working on this the better,” says Kuansan Wang, who is in charge of Microsoft's effort. He says that Semantic Scholar is going deeper into natural-language processing—that is, understanding the meaning of full sentences in papers and queries—but that Microsoft’s tool, which is powered by the semantic search capabilities of the firm's web-search engine Bing, covers more ground, with 160 million publications. Like Semantic Scholar, Microsoft Academic provides useful (if less extensive) filters, including by author, journal or field of study. And it compiles a leaderboard of most-influential scientists in each subdiscipline. These are the people with the most ‘important’ publications in the field, judged by a recursive algorithm (freely available) that judges papers as important if they are cited by other important papers. The top neuroscientist for the past six months, according to Microsoft Academic, is Clifford Jack of the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota. Other scholars say that they are impressed by Microsoft’s effort. The search engine is getting close to combining the advantages of Google Scholar’s massive scope with the more-structured results of subscription bibliometric databases such as Scopus and the Web of Science, says Anne-Wil Harzing, who studies science metrics at Middlesex University, UK, and has analysed the new product. “The Microsoft Academic phoenix is undeniably growing wings,” she says. Microsoft Research says it is working on a personalizable version—where users can sign in so that Microsoft can bring applicable new papers to their attention or notify them of citations to their own work—by early next year. Other companies and academic institutions are also developing AI-driven software to delve more deeply into content found online. The Max Planck Institute for Informatics, based in Saarbrücken, Germany, for example, is developing an engine called DeepLife specifically for the health and life sciences. “These are research prototypes rather than sustainable long-term efforts,” says Etzioni. In the long term, AI2 aims to create a system that will answer science questions, propose new experimental designs or throw up useful hypotheses. “In 20 years’ time, AI will be able to read—and more importantly, understand—scientific text,” Etzioni says.

Although the new device might not named Nexus 7 because as everyone knows Google has shut down their Nexus line of smartphone devices, the Nexus 7 might get re-branded as a Pixel device. Even if Google wants to re-brand their new tablet as a Pixel device, they might decide not to do it. The reason behind this is because Google customers are already familiar with the Nexus brand and changing its name is surely going to require them to spend extra money to advertise the new tablet. Rumors surrounding the upcoming Google tablet are saying that Google is going to launch it until 2016 ends, but this might not be the case. There are other speculations that point out the fact that because the tablet is going to receive new hardware updates, Google is required to delay the launch date for the tablet to 2017. The Nexus lines of devices are known to be focused towards mid range budgets, thus making them affordable, but now that Google might re-brand them as a Pixel device, their price might be increased. The price can get increased also because of the tech upgrades the tablet is going to receive. Many tech analysts are reporting that the upcoming Nexus 7 is going to be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 in addition with a Andreno 530 GPU. The tablet is going to sport a 13MP main camera and it’s also going to have 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage space. The device is going to ship with an AMOLED screen display, 5,100 mAh battery and USB Type-C ports for faster data transfer. The OS is rumored to be the new Andromeda OS, which is a combination of Android OS with Chrome OS.

Google to shut down Map Maker, its crowdsourced map editing tool Posted Nov 8, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Alexa, who is winning the presidential election? Since 2008, Google has run an online tool called Map Maker that allows anyone worldwide to contribute data to Google Maps. Now, that tool is shutting down. The company announced today in its online forum for the project that the Google Map Maker service, as a standalone product, is retiring in March 2017. However, crowdsourced contributions to Google Maps are not ending, the company noted – instead, those will be transitioned to Google’s Local Guides program. Local Guides, to some extent, is a modernized version of the years-old Map Maker service. The older service offered an online tool and editor that let anyone submit updates to Google Maps, which moderators could then approve. The larger goal was to fill out Google Maps with road and business information in less developed regions where detailed local maps were not as readily available. However, as you may recall, Map Maker’s crowdsourced functionality also got Google into trouble in years past. For example, in 2015, Map Maker was used to vandalize Google Maps with an image of Google’s Android character urinating on the Apple logo. The company had to shut down Map Maker temporarily, following this and other spam attacks and obscene edits. Even as Map Maker was struggling to police its community, Google was developing its Local Guides program. The initiative, which began something like Google’s own version of Yelp Elites, today offers a way for volunteers to contribute to Google Maps and Google business listings, in exchange for points, rewards, as well as invites to special events and early access new features. Guides can earn points for a variety of tasks, like writing reviews, adding or editing places, posting photos, and more. Map Maker, however, offers an expanded feature set, including the ability to edit roads, for example. Its unique feature set will be merged with Local Guides in preparation for the March 2017 shutdown, as well as after Map Maker is closed. As the features become available, they’ll be posted to both product websites: Map Maker Help Forum and on LocalGuidesConnect.com. In addition, starting today, edits submitted to Google Maps will no longer be available Map Maker for moderation. This is so Google can streamline its efforts and speed up the time it takes to publish these edits, says the company. The shutdown makes sense given the overlap between the two initiatives, Map Maker and Local Guides. The shift should also cut down on the spamming and vandalism problems, thanks to the newer systems for editing and approvals. However, whether or not Google will be able to shift its full set of Map Maker editing tools to the newer platform by the time Map Maker shuts its doors still remains to be seen. Google used to announce its product shutdowns in larger batches, dubbed ‘spring cleanings.’ But this time around (and in the fall), the company has been more quietly closing up services without the fanfare. Yesterday, for instance, it shut down its move site, Google Showtimes. “Over the past year, we’ve rolled out new, easy ways for people to help keep Google Maps up to date by allowing them to make edits directly from the Google Maps app and through Google Search. Based on these efforts, in addition to our new Local Guides program, we’ve decided to retire Map Maker in order to improve and expedite the Maps editing experience on both mobile and desktop,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch, about the company’s decision to end Map Maker. “We greatly appreciate the millions of edits the Map Maker community has contributed over the years and encourage them to continue adding their local knowledge to Google Maps through our recently launched contribution channels and by joining the growing community of Local Guides,” they added.

With entries closing on Saturday, 26th of November, Leitrim students have only a short time remaining to enter their doodles for this year’s ‘If I could create anything it would be…’ theme. Three students from Leitrim made the regional finals in previous years and it is hoped more will make the regional final this year.  The prizes for this year’s doodles include a €5,000 scholarship towards the student’s third-level education, with their winning doodle also appearing on the Google.ie homepage for 24 hours. In addition, the overall winner and their teacher will receive a Chromebook laptop each, with their school also receiving a €10,000 technology grant. Five other category winners and their teachers will also receive Chromebooks. Fionnuala Meehan, VP and Site Lead of Google Ireland said, “The amount of entries we have received so far is in the hundreds which will make the decision tough for our judges. We want to encourage as many children across the country to enter, and for those that have yet to do so, there is still plenty of time.” The 75 finalists will have their doodles displayed on the Doodle 4 Google website and the general public will be able to vote for their favourite doodle. The winners of each category will go attend the grand finale event in the Google headquarters in Dublin where they overall winner will be chosen. The class groups include: •             Class Group 1 – Junior Infants, Senior Infants •             Class Group 2 - 1st Class, 2nd Class, 3rd Class, •             Class Group 3 – 4th Class, 5th Class, 6th Class •             Class Group 4 – 1st Year, 2nd Year, 3rd Year •             Class Group 5 – Transition Year, 5th Year, 6th Year, Youthreach Schools can enter the competition by logging onto the competition website https://doodles.google.ie/d4g/   Leave your comment Share your opinions on Text Characters left: 1500 Digital newsstand Our latest editions exactly as they are printed Buy edition Browse edition 40 % of garda budget went towards the policing of public order issues 'Public order problem in County Leitrim' claims Supt Dáil Eireann Two Leitrim TDs vote for politician pay increase The St. Brigid's team who defeated Aughawillan to reach the Connacht Senior Club Final.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube The Google Pixel XL is one of two phones that Google has recently released. It is Google’s latest smartphone effort and it comes packing the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, the latest chipset from Qualcomm which offers improvements over its predecessor, the Snapdragon 820 which has found its way into many a flagship phone in 2016. One of those flagship phones is the LG V20, so the question is how does the Pixel XL fare against a phone that has slightly older tech in it? That’s what the folks at PhoneBuff are trying to figure out when they pit both the Pixel XL and LG V20 against each other. For those who can’t be bothered to watch the entire video, spoiler alert as the Pixel XL manages to pull ahead in terms of speed, at least at the start. The Pixel XL manages to successfully complete the first lap in 1 minute and 36 seconds, while the LG V20 took 1 minute 43 seconds, although to be fair it isn’t exactly lagging too far behind. However come the second lap, it seems that in terms of memory management, the LG V20 is handling it much better. The phone completes the second lap in 2 minutes and 27 seconds, while the Pixel XL took 2 minutes and 57 seconds, widening the gap considerably. This is actually not the first time that the Pixel XL has lost to its “older” competition, like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. It also lost to Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus. However this is by no means an indication that the Pixel phones are bad. Chances are in real-life usage you might not even be able to tell the difference, so as long as you’re happy with it, who’s to tell you otherwise? Filed in Cellphones.

Photograph: Google/Facebook Contact author @GreensladeR Saturday 12 November 2016 03.40 EST Last modified on Saturday 12 November 2016 03.43 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger This letter, Support new news providers via a levy on digital giants like Google and Facebook, was published in the print issue of the Guardian on Saturday: “Digital intermediaries such as Google and Facebook are not only amassing eye-watering profits and paying minimal tax in the UK, they are also bleeding the newspaper industry dry by sucking up advertising revenue. As national and local newspapers try to cut their way out of trouble by slashing editorial budgets and shedding staff, journalistic quality is becoming a casualty. Public interest journalism in particular has been hit the hardest as newspapers are lured into a clickbait culture which favours the sensational and the trivial. In the light of this, we propose a 1% levy on the operations of the largest digital intermediaries with the resulting funds redistributed to non-profit ventures with a mandate to produce original local or investigative news reporting. This kind of cross-subsidy is what sustained Channel 4 in its formative years. We believe that it is now time for policymakers to address the emergent gaps in the supply of diverse media and to secure the trusted and independent news system that our democracy so desperately needs. We are backing an amendment to the digital economy bill currently going through parliament and will continue to press for a news media that places the public interest above those of shareholder and vested interests.” It is signed by: Michelle Stanistreet General secretary, National Union of Journalists Justin Schlosberg Chair, Media Reform Coalition Helen Goodman MP Amelia Womack Deputy leader, Green Party of England and Wales Prof Des Freedman Goldsmiths, University of London Prof Justin Lewis Cardiff University Prof Roy Greenslade City, University of London Prof Brian Cathcart Kingston University Prof Natalie Fenton Goldsmiths Prof Angela Phillips Goldsmiths Prof James Curran Goldsmiths Prof Greg Philo Glasgow University Prof Steven Barnett University of Westminster Prof John Downey Loughborough University Damian Tambini London School of Economics Peter Jukes Paul Mason Prof Julian Petley Brunel University Ann Field Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom Thomas Barlow Real Media Kerry-Anne Mendoza Editor, The Canary Prof Ivor Gaber Sussex University Paul Lashmar Sussex University Dan Jackson Bournemouth University Molly Scott-Cato Green MEP for South West England Sally Broughton Micova University of East Anglia Ronnie Draper General secretary, BFAWU Bob Monks General secretary, URTU Kevin Courtney General secretary, NUT More blogposts Topics Public service reporting Facebook Google Newspapers Digital media More… Media downturn Newspapers & magazines Social media Channel 4 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Google has recently released a $6,000 interactive whiteboard called Jamboard for use in office meetings.  (Google / via The Associated Press)   By Steven OverlyThe Washington Post Sat., Nov. 12, 2016 The latest product to be unveiled by tech giant Google was not a new smartphone or wearable device or search feature designed to be used by millions of everyday consumers. Rather, it was a $6,000 whiteboard designed to be used in your office conference room. The release of Jamboard puts the Silicon Valley behemoth into the niche but increasingly competitive market of interactive whiteboards, the high-tech equivalent of those dry-erase boards that employees use to scrawl out diagrams, lead presentations or brainstorm new ideas. Microsoft and Google have both gotten into the interactive whiteboard market this year, creating new competition for the largest and most entrenched player, Smart Technologies, a Canadian firm recently acquired by Foxconn. “The last piece of equipment in the office and classroom that hasn’t made it into the modern age is the whiteboard,” said Smart Technologies chief technology officer Warren Barkley. “We, along with Microsoft and Google, see this as an opportunity to move that static, physically isolated content into the wider world.” Though commonplace today, the standard whiteboard is an innovation itself. Popularized in the late 1980s and 1990s, the whiteboard has, in many instances, replaced the dusty blackboard that always left hands, clothes and floors coated in a thin layer of chalk residue. Article Continued Below The digital whiteboard is a more modern invention and it continues to evolve. Smart Technologies takes credit for creating the first interactive whiteboard in 1991. Barkley said those devices were primarily large display devices that used projectors and had maybe one or two touch points. Today, interactive whiteboards come with high-tech LED touch screens whose ease of use more closely resembles a tablet computer. That evolution has come with fits and starts, he said, and new arrivals could advance it further. Google’s Jamboard is a 55-inch touchscreen monitor that connects to the cloud and taps into Google’s G Suite of productivity apps, including Google Drive, Docs and Calendar. Equipped with machine learning technology, the board is marketed as a tool for companies to make information gathering and brainstorming more seamless. As senior product manager T.J. Varghese said succinctly in a recent blog post, “At Google, we’ve set out to redefine meetings.” Varghese wrote in an email that the company will first offer Jamboard to the roughly two million customers who subscribe to its workplace software, and it will review how those businesses put the board to use before selling it to other corporate customers. It’s unclear whether Jamboard will have a meaningful impact on Google’s income. It strikes a different tone from the company’s other products, which are generally lower cost and marketed to the masses, because the electronic whiteboard is distinctly aimed at a business crowd with a hefty IT budget. Google also faces stiff competition in the workplace technology market, said Vanessa Thompson, a research analyst at IDC, a market research firm specializing in technology. In March, Microsoft began shipping its own interactive whiteboard, called Surface Hub. Much as Jamboard integrates with Google’s other products, Surface Hub integrates with Microsoft’s established slate of workplace software, including Skype and Microsoft Office. The 55-inch Surface Hub sells for $8,999, and the 84-inch version goes for $21,999. “At the very highest level, I would say almost every company today is going through some form of digital transformation,” said Julia Atalla, senior director of Microsoft’s Windows and Devices group. “Medium- to large-size businesses, they’re looking at ways they can innovate faster.” Interactive whiteboard purveyors say their products meet that need. Collaboration has become harder in office environments where some employees work remotely or travel often, and information is increasingly stored in digital formats and shared through email. Having a digital interface that all workers in a meeting can connect with to share information, video conference and otherwise engage makes those gatherings more productive, they say. But IT trends could also make the large capital investment needed to purchase the boards harder to justify, Thompson of IDC said. “There are some macro trends impacting the way we work, like decentralization in large organizations, small team-oriented work, personal productivity tools augmenting tools provided by organizations,” Thompson said. “These behavioural themes mean that workers are just as likely to use personal tools to share and collaborate as they are a space in the office.” Read more about: Google The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Now, Google has added four more options for Pixel and Pixel XL users. After showing up on Verizon’s website the other night, Google has debuted the “Trends” and “Earth” Live Cases for the Pixel and Pixel XL, priced at $50 a piece. Both cases are available as-is, not offering customization options like other Live Cases do. The “Earth” case shows satellite photos of portions of the planets, specifically a desert, coastline, and ice. If the imagery looks familiar, you probably recognize it from last year’s Nexus smartphones where two of these images were pre-loaded as wallpapers. “Trends” brings a simple gradient which is — at least in my opinion — pretty bland. The gray option goes from white to black, top to bottom. The orange option goes from a light orange tone to an almost hot pink color. Currently, these two cases are listed as “coming soon.” Another new Live Case option is from the artworks series with designs from Jeremy Scott. These cases feature a cast of emoji characters and are available for the Pixel and Nexus devices. Jeremy Scott also has a collection of GIFs with the included GIF keyboard which you can use in conversations. That case is available for $40, like the other currently available Live Cases. Last, Google has also released the Otterbox Defender case on the Google Store for both the Pixel and the Pixel XL. Pricing lands at $49.95 and $59.95, respectively. Like the Defender series case for other smartphones, this case offers 3-layer protection from drops as well as adding a screen protector on the front. If you’re a bit rough on your phone, this might be worth the investment.

(Google) I always thought Google was missing out on a great opportunity in not having its own phone to take advantage of its Android operating system. Apple learned early on that controlling entire hardware and software systems was the way to go, but Google seemed content to just work on the software end. Sure, there were a few forgettable Google-branded Nexus phones, but they were far from the best Android handsets. Now Google has decided to dive in head-first and design its own phones, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. HTC is building the phones, but the design is all Google’s. Let’s get one thing out of the way first – Google’s Pixel looks like an iPhone. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Apple has sold millions of iPhones, and the design and look are proven hits. But even though it looks like an iPhone and costs the same as the iPhone (starting at $650), there are hardware differences that are worth mentioning. HARDWARE AND SPECS I’ve been using the non-XL Pixel for the last few weeks, so my hands-on thoughts will focus on the smaller version. The Pixel is built around a 5-inch AMOLED screen made from Corning Gorilla Glass 4 with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (441 pixels per inch). It runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor with four gigabytes of RAM and ships with 32 gigabytes or 128 gigabytes of storage. The sleep-wake button is high on the right edge, but the volume rocker button is also on the right. This put all the buttons comfortably under your thumb (if you’re right-handed). The big difference in the Pixel’s design is the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the phone’s back, which happens to be exactly where my index finger rests when I’m holding the phone. Putting the fingerprint reader on the back isn’t really better or worse than the iPhone’s front placement – it’s a matter of taste. Because the Pixel chose the back, I have to pick up the phone to unlock it with my finger. I do find I keep my iPhone lying on my desk, so I am able to just touch my finger to the reader without picking up the phone to check a message or text. The body is made of aluminum, but the top third of the phone’s backside is also glass. The main camera has a 12-megapixel sensor and an f/2.0 lens. The front camera has an 8-megapixel sensor with an f/2.4 lens. The camera is top-notch. The Pixel is on par with Apple’s iPhone 7 or Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge. I can’t say enough nice things about the camera on the Pixel. I also love invoking the camera app by a quick double flip of the phone or double tapping the sleep-wake button. Google also includes unlimited cloud storage for all photos and videos taken with the Pixel. The charger is USB-C, which seems to be where the world is headed (except for iPhones). The Pixel’s USB-C port uses the faster USB 3.0, which means much faster transfers. According to Google, 15 minutes of USB-C charging from the included 18-watt power supply will provide seven hours of power. The Pixel’s physical dimensions are 5.6 inches by 2.7 inches by 0.2 inches, and it weighs 5.04 ounces. It’s about a quarter of an inch longer than my iPhone 6s. The 2,770 ampere-hour battery easily lasted a day for my use. You’ll find the usual radios – 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 along with near field communication. There are a few features you won’t find on the Pixel, including water resistance and stereo speakers (there’s just one). There is no slot for adding storage, and the Pixel does not have wireless charging. ANDROID IN ALL ITS GLORY You may have used Android phones before, but you really haven’t used Android as Google intended. Different wireless carriers and phone manufacturers put their own software on top of Android, often cluttering up the landscape. The Pixel runs pure, unadulterated Android 7.1, and it’s the only phone to feature Google’s new Assistant. Simply say “OK, Google,” and you’ll invoke the Google Assistant, which will answer questions, manage tasks, find photos, entertain you and help you stay on schedule. I think Google’s Assistant is much better than Apple’s Siri. You can have an actual conversation with Assistant. I asked the Assistant how to get to a local park, and the directions from my location were displayed on a Google map. Then I asked, “When was it built?” and the Assistant brought up an article about the park and when it was built. Very cool. There are some other Android tweaks you’ll notice. I had to look up the way you call up the app list on the Pixel. With other Android phones, you’ll have an icon to bring up all the apps. On the Pixel, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up the apps. The apps are also pretty uniform in their appearance. All the included app icons are round. Third-party apps still can be shaped differently, but I like the round look. Overall the phone was very snappy and responsive. CONCLUSIONS I’m really happy Google has decided to get into the phone game. The company has the most popular operating system, and it’s about time it designed its own hardware to take advantage of it. I’m a longtime iPhone user, so I’m a sucker for the design. I’m still on the fence about the fingerprint sensor placement. There is a lot to like about the Pixel and Pixel XL. I realize this isn’t an in-depth review, but there are plenty of places online to find those. The Pixel is a hit with me, and it joins the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy 7 phones in the top tier of handsets. I can’t wait to see what Google does with the next version of the Pixel The Pixel costs $649 and the XL costs $769 for the 32gb model. Add $100 to each to increase the storage to 128gb. They are available from Google, Verizon stores or Best Buy. You might see commercials or websites that say the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive, but that’s just for sales. If you buy the Pixel through Google, it’s unlocked for use on any carrier.

Microsoft has long offered free mobile versions of Word, PowerPoint, and other Office apps, but the company is set to exclude more devices from that offering as Google blurs the line between notebooks and mobile devices. Google is gradually implementing the ability to run Android apps on laptops and desktops powered by its Chrome operating system, and Microsoft announced this week that it will include Chromebooks with screens larger than 10.1" in an existing policy that prevents larger Android devices from running free Office apps. "After signing in with a free Microsoft account, the core viewing, creating, editing and printing experience is free in Office apps for iOS, Android and Windows 10 Mobile, on devices 10.1" or smaller," Microsoft said in a statement to 9to5Google. While users who have opted in to the beta version of the Google Play store for Chrome OS might be disappointed that they can't run the free Office mobile apps, the policy makes sense from Microsoft's point of view, since the 10.1" screen size restriction is not new. //Related Articles The Best Productivity Apps of 2016 The Verge notes that Microsoft applied the same rules to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro when it was released last year, while the smaller iPad Pro still retains free access to Microsoft Office. On Android or iOS devices larger than 10.1", an Office 365 subscription is required to unlock the ability to create, edit or print documents. Microsoft also clarified that all eligible Chrome OS devices will have access to the free versions of Office apps once the Google Play store for Chrome graduates from beta. "While Google Play on Chrome OS is in beta, we are partnering with Google to deliver the best experience for Chromebook users and plan to make the apps available on all compatible devices by general availability," according to the company's statement.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Google+ On Mobile Browsers Now Supports AMP Links By Tyler Lee on 11/11/2016 16:42 PST One of the features of Facebook for mobile is that it supports Instant Articles, which are basically links to webpages that load instantly. Google has their own answer to Instant Articles in the form of Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) which the company has been pushing more aggressively in recent times. Now it seems that Google is bringing AMP to Google+, kind of like what Facebook has done with Instant Articles. However in Google’s case, AMP will be available in the mobile browser version of Google+, not within the actual Google+ app itself. This means that if you are browsing Google+ on your phone using Chrome or another browser, you can expect to find AMP pages being compatible with the social networking platform. All you’ll have to do is keep an eye out for the little lightning bolt icon next to the link to know that it is an AMP-friendly website. According to Google, “Now when you browse G+ on the Web on your phone, look for the little lightning bolt icon to load articles up to 4x faster, using up to 10x less data. Enjoy, and stay tuned as we add support for more platforms and publishers in the near future.” Of course whether or not websites take advantage of AMP is an entirely different story, but so far we are starting to see a fair bit of adoption (Ubergizmo is also AMP-friendly, by the way!) so hopefully more publishers and developers get on board with it in the future.

Google Daydream View VR Headset First Look Consumer Reports 3 days ago © Provided by Consumer Reports When it comes to types of VR headsets, most fall into two camps: Either very high-end pricey models connected to a computer or video-game console, like the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive, or lower-end cheap models, like the Google Cardboard, $15, that rely on a smartphone. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 106.65 +0.94 +0.89% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 58.92 +0.80 +1.38% Bank of America Corporation BAC ▼ 19.88 -0.21 -1.02% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▲ 31.73 +0.36 +1.15% However, there is a third type that's cheaper than the Oculus types but more capable than the low-end types. Until now, Samsung’s Gear VR, $80, was the most prominent model. But the Gear VR has new competition: Google’s Daydream View, also about $80, goes on sale in stores today. The View functions very much like the Samsung Gear. For instance, you can use the headset only with select phones. In this case, the View will work only with Google’s new Android-based phones, the Pixel and Pixel XL. But there is one important difference: The View includes a small but very useful remote control. It’s about 4 inches long, an inch-and-a-quarter wide, and a half-inch deep, but it’s very lightweight and has just four buttons.   We just got the Google Daydream View VR headset, and using a Google Pixel XL smartphone, here's what I found:  Comfort and setup. Overall, I found setting up the VR headset and phone to be easy and straightforward. With the phone on, you just place the phone in the headset tray, with the screen toward you, and close the tray’s latch. Then you can put on the headset. You'll go through a few introductory screens in order to orient both the phone and the remote control to the headset. But the instructions were clear and didn't take very long to accomplish. But because the View relies on a phone, I did accidentally hit the phone’s side-panel buttons while adjusting the front of the headset, which locked the phone’s screen. (I had to take off the headset, take out the phone, and unlock my phone's screen.) But for the most part, it’s easy to set up. I also hooked up a pair of earbuds to the Pixel XL, for a more immersive audio experience. One thing I particularly liked was that the VR headset has a fabric—instead of plastic—exterior, which has a foamlike texture but feels nice and is comfortable to wear. The headset is also lightweight and easy to adjust. (Today, the headset is available only in gray, but it will eventually be sold in crimson and light gray.) However, unlike the Samsung Gear VR, there is no diopter type of dial or control to adjust the focus of your smartphone. That would make for a better experience, particularly for those with bad eyes. Remote control. This is a very useful addition, especially in comparison with the Samsung Gear VR. I found the remote control to be intuitive and very easy to use, no matter what apps I used, including games, videos, and photo-based apps. You can also reset the remote control by hitting the remote's home button without needing to take off the headset. Using apps. Visually, I found the experience of using various apps to be very similar to the experience I had when using the Samsung Gear VR. The greatest difference was that I was able to navigate the interface and the apps via the remote control, which was very easy to use. For instance, I liked that I could easily stop and play videos using the remote. One of my favorite parts of using this headset was experiencing my own panorama photos on Google Photos in a VR environment. (Luckily, I had dozens of panoramas already uploaded to my Google Photos.) After installing the Google Photos app on the phone, I had to sign in. Then, while in the Daydream app (which I had loaded onto the Pixel XL via the Google Play store), I could click on a Google Photos icon and bring up my panoramas. Even as still photos, the View really gave me a dramatic, immersive sense of being there, whether it was in front of my house, in Disneyland, or at the beaches of Long Island. Bottom line. Although the Daydream View may not have the sharpness of high-end VR headsets, overall most consumers will find the experience of this headset to be easy to use, captivating, and enjoyable.

It was targetted towards the so called best of Android software running Google Pixel handset. Qihoo 360 won the cash prize of $120,000 for the hack. Respected Chinese hacker outfit Pangu Team renowned for releasing million-dollar persistent modern iOS jailbreaks for free, along with hacker JH, blasted Cupertino's web browser with a root privilege escalation zero day that took 20 seconds to run, earning the team $80,000. Like other monthly software updates from Google, the rolling-out November Android Nougat update brings the latest security patches, bug fixes as well as software tweaks that are aimed at keeping the Nexus and Pixel devices safe. At a security conference in Seoul, a group of white-hat hackers known as Qihoo 360 demonstrated an exploit that allowed for remote code execution on the Pixel. Now if you ask how severe is this hack? "This is before opening Google Chrome with a webpage that reads as 'Pwned by 360 Alpha Team". This was quite aptly put, since the video demonstrated clearly that on the attacker's side, there was access to the phone's full list of permissions, thanks to a background, rogue app install. If for some reason you're looking for a different app that offers up the same functionality (and then some), you'll want to try Fingerprint Gestures, a new app from SuperThomasLab. They did come away with a cash prize of $120,000 though, after their demonstration of the hack. Since these are a bunch of white-hat hackers, they make money by selling such information about the vulnerabilities to the responsible and the concerned parties. Google said that users should stay tuned for the update. 14 November 2016 Here's What Donald Trump Says Hillary Clinton Said in Her Concession Call 13 November 2016 The 'Man from UNCLE' Star Robert Vaughn Has Died 13 November 2016 Premature to talk about Russia-US relations 13 November 2016 Chinese e-shoppers spend billions on Singles Day Heavy security as Sting reopens Bataclan after Paris attacks 13 November 2016 British Squirrels Have Medieval Leprosy 14 November 2016 Chicago Cubs celebrate with selfie at massive rally 14 November 2016 Socialist-backed Radev leading in Bulgarian presidential election 13 November 2016 Blast at Sufi shrine in Pakistan kills 10, wounds dozens 14 November 2016 Manny Pacquiao prepares for Vargas as Mayweather rematch looms 13 November 2016 Lewis Hamilton: I've had Nico Rosberg covered so far 13 November 2016 New national poll has Clinton barely edging Trump Most Read Most Commented England coach Bennett: We need to clean up our act Bennett said it was up to his players to get rid of poor habits learned in Super League between now and next year's World Cup.

Post an ad After Trump win, Silicon Valley reassesses security By: craig timberg and elizabeth dwoskin The Washington Post November 14, 2016 0 Caption + President-elect Donald Trump pumps his fist during an election night rally, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016, in New York. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) The election of Republican Donald Trump has stunned Silicon Valley, sparking renewed fears about how the federal government's powerful surveillance machinery could undermine personal privacy - especially in the hands of a man with a history of threatening retaliation against those who challenge him. Yet as some prepare to take new high-tech defensive measures against government intrusion, there also is a note of regret: The campaign of Trump's rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, suffered a series of disruptions when poorly protected emails fell into the hands of Russian hackers, WikiLeaks and, finally, the FBI. Better digital security, including measures long advocated by some experts, might have prevented Clinton's defeat, they say. These twin forces - fear and regret - are fueling demands for the tech industry to push a new wave of security and privacy upgrades that would build on those adopted by the tech industry in the aftermath of the revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. Such measures could impede criminal hackers and foreign intelligence services but also make it more difficult for law enforcement officials to discover and collect evidence in authorized investigations. "Everyone is asking about the role of the surveillance state in a Trump presidency," said Peter Eckersley, technology projects director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based civil liberties group. "People are very worried and urgently trying to figure out what they can do." In Silicon Valley, many were dazed after Tuesday's election. Some companies let their employees take the day off or wrote all-staff letters reminding their colleagues of their commitment to inclusive workplaces that protect women, immigrants and minorities. Techies, meanwhile, warned one another on Twitter to begin using privacy and encrypted tools. "If you want to oppose Trump, use Tor browser, get home VPN, start using the Signal app, 2FA on phone," one tweet said. "My Twitter timeline is off the hook," said Larry Gadea, founder and chief executive of the start-up Envoy, which enables businesses to register visitors using iPads. "People are saying to use bitcoin and encrypted messages, etc." Officials from tech giants such as Google, Apple and Facebook said they were watching closely for clues to Trump's technology policies. During the campaign, Trump vowed to "penetrate the internet" to prevent ISIS from using it to recruit fighters and chastised Apple for refusing to create a backdoor that would let the FBI unlock an iPhone used by the attackers in the San Bernardino shootings. Lobbyists for internet companies, including Amazon, Uber and Airbnb, arranged a meeting among themselves for next week and scrambled to publish a position paper on subjects ranging from immigration to cybersecurity. Officials at the companies said it was difficult to know how Trump would act because his campaign had barely communicated with the tech sector. Tech companies have raced to protect consumer data from government intrusion since the Snowden revelations. Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Yahoo have all made significant investments in encryption to address customer concerns about privacy invasions. A secure messaging app called Signal was the top trending item in Apple's App Store on Thursday. "A lot of people have been seeing the writing on the wall," said Moxie Marlinspike, founder of Open Whisper Systems, which developed Signal. "It's immensely clear that things have not generally been in great shape in terms of private communications. . That's something that everybody is concerned about." Yet some efforts have lagged - with unsettling consequences. The hacking of nude celebrity photos in August 2014 revealed weaknesses in Apple's iCloud service for backing up data. The hack of Sony Pictures a few months later revealed vulnerabilities in server security. And the breach of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's Gmail account in March 2016 provided the raw material for months of embarrassing disclosures exploited by Trump. Experts say the Podesta hack might have been prevented by a security feature called "two-factor authentication," which Google has long made available to its users but has not required. "Two-factor authentication" requires users to have both a password and a "second factor" - often a numeric code delivered by a text or authentication app - to access their accounts. The most advanced hackers still might have found a way to access Podesta's accounts, but it would have been far more difficult, experts say. "The people at the top are just as bad at computer security as regular Americans," said Christoper Soghoian, chief technologist for the ACLU. "They are sitting ducks for the most basic of attacks." In a live-stream video appearance Thursday, Snowden also urged internet users to adopt two-factor authentication. Though some hacks appear to be the work of foreign intelligence services - U.S. officials blamed the Sony hack on North Korea, the Podesta hack on Russia - the election of Trump has revived fear of the U.S. government itself. In the closing days of the campaign, the FBI unexpectedly and publicly reopened its investigation of Clinton's use of a private email server after finding thousands of emails on a computer used by an aide, Huma Abedin. That discovery, which came during an unrelated probe into her estranged husband, might never have been made, experts say, if Abedin had used a security measure called "end-to-end encryption" that makes it more difficult for anybody other than the intended recipient to access messages or even their routing information. There is even more concern about the reach of the NSA, whose sprawling surveillance apparatus sparked a worldwide backlash after Snowden shared troves of information with The Washington Post and other news organizations. Even some people who defended the NSA under President Barack Obama have expressed concern about how it might be used by Trump. "I have full faith that the appropriate balance of power and constraint exist when people play by the rules. It's not clear yet that a President Trump would," said former NSA lawyer Susan Hennessey, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. "There's certainly potential for huge abuse of the national security apparatus, both at the NSA and across the intelligence community."

The bug was discovered in Chrome 35 in July 2014 in the history.pushState() HTML5 function, a way of adding web pages into the session history without actually loading the page in question. The developer who reported the issue published code showing how to add so many items into Chrome’s history list that the browser would effectively freeze. It’s taken a while for cybercriminals to get around to exploiting this bug, but they’re now using it in a new attack reported by researcher slipstream/RoL. From the descriptions of those who fell foul of the attack, Chrome would pop up a Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs window, after which the browser would lock up. At this point, a bogus Microsoft support page loaded to inform users that their system was infected while urging them to call the scammers’ toll-free phone number for help. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More From screenshots, this looks convincing enough to fool some people some of the time – right down to its helpful technical details with only one typo near the end. Microsoft Identification-Malware infected website visited. Malicious data transferred to system from unauthorized access. System Registry files may be changed and can be used for unethical activites. [sic] System has been infected by Virus Trojan.worm!055BCCAC9FEC – Personal information (Bank Details, Credit Cards and Account Password) may be stolen. Beating the attack isn’t hard. Users can either close Chrome using the Task Manager or, in cases where the browser is using up so much processor power that Task Manager doesn’t appear, by rebooting the computer. Google was apparently told about the issue when it was discovered, but it remains unfixed in the latest version, Chrome 53. The chances of encountering this particular scam are small – it’s only been spotted on a single website – but its existence underlines how small bugs that don’t seem terribly important may nevertheless be abused by cyercriminals down the line. Web browsers have long been a source of intrigue for scammers – whether by hijacking, redirecting or, as in this case, locking up a session. By tricking your browser into misbehaving, the scammers can pressure you into thinking that what’s wrong is sufficiently dangerous that you should pay up for help. Tech support scams go back many years but seem to have enjoyed a recent resurgence. As Microsoft noted in a recent study, as many as 20% of users who encounter fake support scams lose money. Ironically, the brand most abused by fake support criminals is Microsoft itself, precisely because people trust it. DEALING WITH FAKE SUPPORT CALLS Here’s a short podcast you can recommend to friends and family. We make it clear it clear that these guys are scammers (and why), and offer some practical advice on how to deal with them.

The app was created by Dartmouth college professors Mikhail Gronas and Joseph Bafumi. Gronas is a professor in digital humanities and Slavic studies and Bafumi is a professor in American politics. Gronas and Bafumi noticed the attraction that kids and college students were having toward “Pokemon Go” and believed they could, “lessen the acrimony” that came along with the election processes with their own take on the game. “Since the birth of democracy in ancient Greece, modern politics has been, in essence, a competitive game,” Mikhail Gronas said. “Games are often considered a less serious social activity; however, elections are some of our nation’s most important political decisions and are very much game-like: we follow the scores or polls, and we root for our teams.” The game uses the same geo-tracking feature as the “Pokemon Go” game but that’s the only similarity. Instead of capturing Pokemon you capture candidate “booths.” When users walk or drive around neighborhoods discovering the nearly 1 million “booths” they shake their mobile devices, sending out good vibes. When the “booth” receives 50 “good vibes” endorsing a single candidate, that candidate captures that spot on the map. If a candidate wins a “booth” you hear a sound bite from that candidate when you approach them on the map. The game creates a map of the political affiliation of neighborhoods, cities, counties and states. I used the Android version and felt this game was not a good source of entertainment. There is nothing to do. There are less than 5,000 total downloads. The iTunes version had three reviews.      “It’s hilarious how this app pushes the two party system even when the whole object of ‘Pokemon Go’ was the diversity of the creatures. This is such garbage. Add Jill Stein, Gary Johnson and others or get rated one star,” iTunes member harryprayiv said. The only thing interesting about this game is the conspiracies behind it. As we all know this game is a version of “Pokemon Go.” What you probably know is that “Pokemon Go” uses Google Maps to guide you along your way to find Pokemon. You take that further by mapping out the inside of your house and workplace. Niantic Labs, formerly a part of Google, that created “Pokemon Go” confirm that your information might be shared in the future. In fact, you acknowledge and agree to this, when you sign the terms and conditions to create your game account. “Pokemon Go” along with all of Google services are actually illegal in China. Allegedly, they believe the United States and Japan are teaming up to use Google and its services to spy on them and the rest of the world. Conspiracy theorist believe factions such as NSA are employing app developers such as Niantic to get private information you otherwise would not give out due to privacy issues and this “HillaryDonald Go” app is an attempt to add a political layer to the Google Maps. What you may not know is that these two games are a version of a Niantic game called “Ingress.” “Ingress” has been accused of using its app to profit participating businesses. “Ingress,” like “Pokemon Go” and “HillaryDonald Go” profiles you by tracking your everyday activities and where you are at all times. Businesses can host events and parties called “portals,” like “booths” where app users meet up similar to “Pokemon Go” luring cites. “Ingress” is aimed at people who can afford a more lavish lifestyle. Users have leased airplanes and boats to reach portals in remote areas of Siberia and Alaska. “HillaryDonald Go” did not do much to get anyone off their couches and interested in the election. It failed as a game. Maybe it succeeded in determining that the people who did use the app wanted third party acknowledgement.   Brian Williams 2016-11-13 Kayla Stroud Share tweet Tags Brian Williams Previous Blazers Shutout Shorter 44-0 Next Twitter snips Vine: Video apps compete for viewers Related Articles VSU’s newest restaurant, Which Wich, aims to make eating there an experience 12 mins ago Should we do away with Electoral College? 2 hours ago Twitter snips Vine: Video apps compete for viewers 1 day ago Check Also Blazers Shutout Shorter 44-0 Written by Juston Lewis, Staff Writter En route to the playoffs, the Blazers rout Shorter ...

Not as Black Friday deal but Verizon is offering BOGO deals on high-end Android phones. (Photo : Spencer Platt / Getty Images) With Black Friday around the corner, it is time for deals. Not as Black Friday deal though but Verizon is offering BOGO deals on high-end Android phones. The Verizon 50 percent off deal is applicable on Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 edge, Google Pixel, Pixel XL and LG V20. Advertisement The Verizon BOGO Deal: How To Avail The Benefit The deal is applicable on the second phone you buy, so it will not benefit you if you are planning to buy just one phone. The 50 percent discount would be available only on the second phone if you buy the first one on a device payment plan. The Verizon BOGO deal is applicable on only the premium phone mentioned earlier. The discount can be availed on the phone of same or lower price value. The total discount offered on the second phone is massive considering the high prices of the phones. It is not clear till what time will Verizon run the offer. But with a number of discounts it is offering, don't expect a long period offer. It is also not clear whether an equivalent scheme would be launched for iPhones, as reported in Droid-Life. Advertisement Verizon BOGO Deal Pricing Verizon is offering different pricing based on the phone. LG V20 can be bought at $28 per month for 24 months, Samsung Galaxy S7 at $28 per month, Google Pixel costs $27.08 per month, Galaxy S7 edge costs $33 per month, and Pixel XL costs $32.08 per month. Whichever phone one buys, the final amount at the end of 24 months is above $600. So for the second phone, one can get a discount of at least $ 300. The Verizon BOGO deal offers discounts better than Black Friday deals. The offer is a limited-time offer, so if you intend to avail it, hurry up. For Apple products, the best deals on this Black Friday may be on refurbished products. Some retailers are offering discounts on earlier iPhones but when compared with Verizon deals, they are not worth considering.

A team called White-Hat hackers from Qihoo 360 was able to demonstrate the ability to achieve remote code execution to win the cash prize of $120,000 for hacking the Pixel. In order to get the remote code execution (RCE) on the smartphone, the team first showed a proof-of-concept exploit which used a zero-day vulnerability. The exploit allowed the intruders to install malicious code on Google’s new own-brand smartphones without any difficulty. Qihoo 360 used the vulnerability to launch the Google Play Store before opening Chrome and displaying a web page with the message “Pwned By 360 Alpha Team”. The team then went on to hack the Adobe Flash with a combination of a decade-old, vulnerability method and won cash prize of $120,000 again. This is not the first time that a hacker team has reported security vulnerabilities of the Google Pixel. Prior to Qihoo, Keen Team of Tencent discovered and used a zero-day exploit to get into the smartphone data at the Mobile Pwn2Own event in Japan. Google has been informed about both the vulnerabilities, which is most likely to be fixed via monthly security update patches. Further, besides Pixel and Adobe Flash, Microsoft Edge in Windows 10 was also hacked in PwnFest hacking competition. The concerned companies are said to be notified about the exploits so that they could repair the vulnerabilities.

Citizen Oracle Latest News CitizenOracle Home Games Mobile Gaming PC Gaming TV Shows Reality Shows Entertainment Tech Samsung Celebrity Fashion iPhone Lifestyle Tech Android 7.0, 7.1 Nexus 6P Release Date; Over-the-Air Installation Rolls Out By John Leuven Lasan Posted on November 13, 2016 Share Tweet Share Share Email Android Nougat 7.0 is available right now and so is the 7.1 update. The good news is that the Nexus users, especially Nexus 6P, Nexus x, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, and the Nexus Player users can already upgrade their current OS to the updated one. Google already released the Android Nougat 7.0, but it has not stopped there. According to the recent reports, they also launched the beta version of Android Nougat 7.1 with a release date last October and the stable version will be in December. Google has started the release date of the November Android security update. However, this security update is only for compatible devices. For the first time, Pixel devices received the security update together with Nexus devices. The news said that this security update can only be downloaded if the users have Android Nougat 7.0 or Android Nougat 7.1 running on their Nexus 6P devices. This news makes most of the Android users somehow disappointed because their devices are not compatible for the update. Various tech reviews are also all over social media. There are several tips given before the users do the installation. OTA (over-the-air) is highly recommended because it does not require the users to erase all the memory. However, it is advisable to back up all data before doing the installation through any method. They added that a very good Wi-Fi strength and battery life must be ensured. Android Nougat 7.0 and 7.1 updates are officially available to Nexus devices, but the majority of Android users might just have to wait a little bit longer for the updated OS to arrive on their devices. There are countless reasons for this. Sadly, there have always been long delays on Android updates, and this is a fact. Moreover, there have been reports about several phones like the Nexus 6P are getting the updated OS while the others are not so much in a hurry.

By Ritesh Bendre | Updated: November 13, 2016 2:52 PM IST Email @GadgetFreak4U comments Tags: google Google Pixel Google Pixel XL News Google’s new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones have been getting rave reviews from critics and users alike. Competing in the high-end segment, these smartphones give iPhone a run for their money. And while Google claims the smartphones to be as secure as iPhones, a team of Chinese hackers were successfully able to hack the Pixel smartphone in less than 60 seconds. At the PwnFest 2016 hacking competition in Seoul, a team called White-Hat hackers from Qihoo 360 demonstrated the ability of achieving remote code execution to gain control of the Google Pixel smartphone. To obtain remote code execution (RCE), the team demonstrated a proof-of-concept exploit that uses a zero-day vulnerability, TheRegister reports. The exploit allows for easy installation of malicious code on Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. The hackers managed to launch the Play Store before opening a web page on Chrome that read “Pwned By 360 Alpha Team,” and won a cash prize of $120,000. This is not the first time the Google Pixel smartphone has been hacked. At the Mobile Pwn2Own event in Japan, Keen Team of Tencent had discovered a zero-day exploit on Pixel, giving them an access to the smartphone’s data. Google has already been informed about the vulnerabilities and a fix for the same is expected as a part of security update patch next month. ALSO READ: Another high-risk Android vulnerability discovered, Google publishes a fix The above video demonstrates how the attackers managed to hack the smartphone. They had a rogue app running in the background, giving them full list of required permissions. The exploit leaves all your data, including contacts, songs, videos, music and communication channels open for the attacker to see. ALSO READ: Google’s full-disk encryption flaw could put millions of Android users at risk The team was able to successfully breach Adobe Flash using a combination of a decade-old, vulnerability and once again won cash prize of $120,000. Pangu Team, on the other hand, was able to fetch $80,000 for breaking through Safari on MacOS Sierra using privilege escalation vulnerability. It roughly took 29 seconds for the team to break past the restrictions. ALSO READ: How to root Google Pixel and Pixel XL in 5 steps Apple’s iOS is closed source, which makes it a little difficult for hackers to break through restrictions. However, in case of Android, its open source design and over the top customizations make it far more vulnerable to hacking. Earlier this year, we have already come across QuadRooter vulnerability that had put about 1 billion Qualcomm-powered Android smartphones at risk. The security flaw gives attackers an unrestricted access to all the sensitive personal data stored on your smartphones. ALSO READ: QuadRooter vulnerability puts nearly 1 billion Qualcomm-powered Android smartphones at risk: Report There was yet another Android vulnerability related to Google’s full-disk encryption that allows one to easily hack encrypted smartphones that are powered by Qualcomm chipsets. The best way to ensure that your smartphone remains safe from malware and other such attacks, it is recommended to download and install the updates whenever available. Also, when an app asks you for permission, be very careful before granting them. For instance, a third-party camera app doesn’t need to access your contacts or text messages. We would also recommend to avoid side-loading apps using APK files.

But whilst the Google Assistant will soon be available to anyone with a device running Android Nougat 7.1, one of the other new features in the Google Pixel was locked to that device alone - until now. The Pixel's rear fingerprint scanner comes with the ability to swipe and scroll using your fingerprint to activate the notification panel. Google had originally said that the feature would be limited to the Pixel, but one app developer has now come up with a solution to transport it to other devices.

With Gear VR, I have to move my head to point a cursor at something, then reach for a button on the headset. With Daydream, I can just aim and click the controller in my hand. Sensors in the device tell the headset what I'm trying to do, whether it's swinging a tennis racket or casting a fishing rod. The headset's display responds accordingly. The headset and controller are sold together for $79. No rush in getting one, though, as the virtual experiences built for Daydream are still limited. And for now, it works only with Google's Pixel phone. THE MANY FLAVORS OF VIRTUAL REALITY While sophisticated systems like Facebook's Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive let you walk around in the virtual world, Daydream View is a sit-down experience in which you use the controller to move yourself around. (You could walk around with the Daydream on if you wanted to, but you won't go anywhere in virtual space – and you might run into the wall.) But the Rift and the Vive each costs more than $1,500, once you include powerful personal computers they require. Suddenly, $79 sounds like a bargain. Daydream stays cheap by using the display and processing power of your phone, which you insert into the headset at eye level. Gear VR, at $100, takes a similar approach, but it works only with Samsung phones. While Daydream works only with Pixel for now, several other Android makers plan to make compatible phones. Sorry, iPhone users. Those without compatible phones still have Google Cardboard, a $15 contraption you hold up to your face. Using Daydream View, by contrast, is more like wearing goggles. While Gear VR has a better fit, with focusing and a second strap over your head to keep the headset from sliding too low, Daydream is much more comfortable to wear and use than Cardboard. ALL ABOUT THAT CONTROLLER Those who've played Nintendo's Wii system will find the Daydream controller familiar. It's about the size and shape of a chocolate bar, and it has motion sensors to track movement. Although I'm not a big gamer, I enjoyed shooting water out of a hose to put out fires. You simply hold a button to spray and move the controller around to douse flames. You can even tilt the controller to control the angle of the hose. Another app lets you explore the universe by using the controller as a laser pointer to bring up more information. The controller makes it easier to navigate menus without making yourself dizzy; just move it around to point at things. And while getting the full 360-degree experience of VR often requires spinning around (a swivel chair helps), some apps in Daydream let you grab the scene with your controller and drag it around you, just as you would with a PC mouse. It's also handy to have volume controls and a home button in your hand rather than on your head. NAUSEA FREE? VR can be nauseating, and Daydream is no different. I found that it's less about the headset, and more about the VR video. The best videos use stationary cameras and let you move your head (or controller) around to explore. The nauseating ones tend to treat VR cameras like regular movie cameras, with a lot of panning in response to a subject's movements. The viewer, not the subject, should be the one doing the moving. And while I enjoyed watching a woman's skydive in VR on YouTube, scenes of her preparing to jump felt jarring because the camera was on her shaky arm. I had to remove my headset. WHAT'S THERE TO DO? You can view 360-degree YouTube videos and any 360-degree photos you store on Google Photos. You can visit other destinations such as the Galapagos Islands in a 360-degree version of Google's Street View. A few games, museum artworks and The Wall Street Journal's app were also available to try out prior to Daydream's Nov. 10 launch. Much more is promised by the end of the year, including apps for Netflix and Hulu – though all that does is offer video on a giant screen in a virtual living room. There's much more available for Cardboard. Unfortunately, app developers will need to make some tweaks first to make them compatible with Daydream. They'll need to do even more to take advantage of the motion control. Daydream has promise, but until more apps arrive, its potential is still a dream.

According to Ms Susan Wojcicki, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of YouTube, the SSA YouTube Award was Google’s way of celebrating African creators. She said “the YouTube Awards celebrates the talent and creativity of YouTube community while serving as platform that shares Africa’s creativity with the rest of the world. “By holding our first-ever YouTube Africa Awards, we hope to celebrate incredible achievements like Olympic medalist Julius Yego show, while also demonstrating our long-term commitment to the continent,” Wojcicki said. She said YouTube Awards were handed out to 25 creators across 23 categories and nominees were chosen based on subscriber numbers. She added that users had to have a minimum of 50,000 subscribers to qualify and must be based and currently residing in one of eight launched countries in SSA. The YouTube boss said that the top non-broadcaster channels were picked from each launched country, describing a launched country as one in which monetisation had been enabled as it was not enabled in all countries globally. Wojcicki listed the eight launched countries in SSA as Tanzania, Ghana, Uganda, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Nigeria, and Senegal, adding that over 70 channels from launched SSA countries had reached over 100,000 subscribers. Mr Teju Ajani of YouTube Partnerships, SSA, said YouTube was about people having opportunities to express themselves. He said “creators across Africa are using YouTube to find their voice, connect with audiences around the world and build channels while earning revenue from it. “The number of hours of video content being uploaded in Africa has doubled in the past two years and the audience has grown with it. “Watch time on mobile phones is growing 120 per cent year over year,” he said. He added that creators like Hakima Raymond who taught himself to conduct an orchestra using YouTube videos had gained international fame on the show “An African City.” Ajani said that the show, which recently hit international headlines for its portrayal of women in Accra, Ghana, was an example of the talent that reside in Africa and was now reaching the world through YouTube. He listed the YouTube content creators to include Nigeria’s Mark Angel Comedy which features six-year-old Emmanuella Samuel, Nigeria’s Channels Television, South African vlogger Suzelle DIY and South African music channel, Yellow Brick Cinema. The full list of winners are Broadcaster; Channels Television, Comedy; Kansiime Anne, Comic; Ramscomics/Supastrikas, Education – Retutpro – Photography and Photoshop Tutorials, Entertainment – NdaniTV, Fitness; Six Pack Factory, Games; Slushy AJ.

As usual, both the 7.0 and 7.1 update are only running on a small number of devices. We’re seeing signs of more and more devices gearing up to get the update already, such as a slew of 2016 Motorola and HTC devices. Android 7.0 brings more customization to the mobile operating system — the notification drawer is more functional, notifications are more useful than ever, and you can now do more work with split-screen mode. Android 7.1 adds onto the list with a few more features, such as App Shortcuts, Seamless Updates, and support for Daydream VR. While these updates had beta programs where many bugs were squashed, there are still a handful of issues afflicting some devices. We’ve scoured the internet to find many lingering issues, some of which only affect certain devices. We’ll continue to add more as we find them, but here are some problems on Android Nougat and potential solutions to fix them. Annoyance: Ambient Display not working This problem is more for Google Pixel owners — the Ambient Display does not show up when notifications come through. The Pixel and Pixel XL do not have a “wake” function that shows the Ambient Display notifications when you pick up your phone — it only turns on when you get a notification. But some people aren’t seeing anything at all. Potential solutions:  A factory reset seems to do the trick for some people. Head to Settings > Backup & reset > Factory data reset > Reset phone. Try the Support team, some people received replacement units as a solution. Head to Settings and swipe left to the Support tab. You should be able to get a replacement unit. If you’re simply looking for a way to have Ambient Display turn on when you pick up your phone, download Ambi-Turner. It triggers the display whenever you take it out of your pocket or lift it up from a desk. Nexus devices with Android 7.1.1 Nougat have a “Lift to Wake” gesture in the Moves section in Settings. We imagine this feature will come to Pixel owners soon.

In a server-side change that some users are reporting, Google Play’s search results are getting a minor revamp. When searching for a particular app, users can directly install the app from search results. This new change is minor, but it makes things easy for installing apps quickly. Specific search terms such as Chrome or Imgur will pull up a card at the top of the search results which includes a few basic app details such as ratings, download totals, and, of course, the app’s title and icon.  Under that, you’ll also have the option to install the app or, if you already have it installed, uninstall or open the app. Below that card, a list of similar apps and recommended apps will appear, followed by the standard search results underneath. So far this change is only appearing for some users, it’s not live on any of our devices, and it’s unclear when the change will roll out to all users.

Take a closer look at these ten companies. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 13, 2016 at 10:00AM Driverless vehicles are often touted as the "next big thing" for both the tech and auto industries. But with so many companies making grand forecasts, it can be tough for investors to identify the true top brands in this fledgling market. Let's take a closer look at the top ten driverless brands, roughly ranked by their market reach. Google's prototype car. Image source: Google. 10. Ford In August, Ford (NYSE:F) CEO Mark Fields claimed that the automaker would mass produce fleets of driverless cars for a commercial ride hailing service by 2021. To do so, it's expanding its Palo Alto center and doubling its employee headcount. Ford also recently acquired Israeli start-up SAIPS, which specializes in computer vision technology that helps vehicles "see" obstacles, and invested in several other companies that develop driverless technologies. 9. Tesla Motors EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) gained a first mover's advantage in the semi-autonomous race with its Autopilot system. That system was recently implicated in a few fatal accidents, but it's continuously being improved with hardware and software updates. CEO Elon Musk recently announced that the company was building fully autonomous EVs powered by Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Drive PX2 platform, eight cameras, 12 updated sensors, and an upgraded radar. Musk believes that a fully autonomous Tesla vehicle could drive from L.A. to New York by the end of 2017. Tesla's Model S. Image source: Tesla. 8. Audi However, Volkswagen's Audi already completed a cross-country trip with an autonomous SQ5 last year. That vehicle was powered by Delphi's (NYSE:DLPH) driverless platform. Audi has also showcased other driverless vehicles like the A7, and claims that the next generation of its A8 sedan will be fully autonomous by 2017. Last December, Audi, Daimler, and BMW co-purchased the HERE mapping service from Nokia. Buying that platform, which is being upgraded from autonomous vehicles, enables the German automakers to address the privacy concerns which Google-controlled vehicles have raised. 7. Daimler Daimler chairman Dieter Zetsche believes that driverless vehicles could hit the market by 2025. That's a more conservative forecast, but the company has already been turning heads with its driverless Mercedes-Benz vehicles. It unveiled a driverless 18-wheeler in 2014, as well as a luxurious F 015 driverless concept sedan last year. The F 015 concept car. Image source: Mercedes-Benz. 6. Nvidia Nvidia's Tegra mobile SoCs (system on chips) power many infotainment and navigation systems in high-end vehicles. Nvidia is expanding deeper into that market with Drive PX, an onboard computer that powers autonomous vehicles. Tesla's new Autopilot system will use the second generation of that platform, PX 2. Nvidia also recently unveiled its next-gen Tegra "Xavier" SoC as an AI "supercomputer on a chip" for self-driving cars, and partnered with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and TomTom to develop new mapping systems for autonomous vehicles. 5. Alphabet Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has been testing out its driverless cars on public roads for several years. Those vehicles use LIDAR systems, which scan the surrounding environment in real-time while using a "high detail" version of Google Maps for navigation. Google wants automakers to ultimately produce driverless cars powered by its software platform, but that could be a tough sell due to the aforementioned privacy issues. 4. Baidu Baidu, the top search engine in China, has been testing out vehicles on public roads since last December. In April, it formed a driverless tech research center in Silicon Valley, with plans to eventually test driverless cars in the U.S. Baidu is outsourcing the production of its cars to Chinese automakers, and has stated that its first commercially available driverless vehicle -- a shuttle bus running on a pre-set loop -- will launch in China in 2018. 3. Mobileye Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) provides ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) to about 90% of leading automakers worldwide. These systems use cheaper technologies like cameras and radars to hit the brakes or sound alerts when obstacles are detected. Mobileye is leveraging that position to expand into autonomous vehicles with its EyeQ computer vision chips. The EyeQ brand suffered a setback this year when Tesla dropped its chipset from its Autopilot systems, but the chipmaker still maintains a strong first mover's advantage in the driverless market. 2. Delphi Automotive Delphi, one of the world's largest auto parts makers, also sells ADAS systems and autonomous solutions. Revenue from those businesses, which generated almost a fifth of the company's sales last quarter, has grown at double-digit rates over the past several quarters. As Delphi's automaker customers gradually upgrade to driverless vehicles, Delphi could gain tremendous bundling power by selling traditional auto parts with ADAS and autonomous solutions. Delphi also recently partnered with Mobileye to launch a fully autonomous vehicle system by 2019. Image source: Delphi. 1. Qualcomm Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world, will soon become the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world after its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors closes. That acquisition will combine NXP's automotive chips and BlueBox platform (which competes against Nvidia's Drive PX) with Qualcomm's Snapdragon Automotive chips and the IoT/automotive chips it acquired from CSR last year. That will make Qualcomm the 800-pound gorilla in connected cars, and allow it to gain substantial content share in autonomous vehicles in the future.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 13, 2016 at 11:29AM Silicon Valley is known as the "cradle of innovation," where tech giants Apple and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google were born. But for every great success story, there are countless flops. Let's take a look back at some of the most memorable disasters. Image source: Getty Images. Solyndra Solyndra designed, manufactured, and sold solar power systems consisting of panels and mounting hardware for low-slope commercial rooftops. Solyndra claimed that its unique cylindrical panels, which captured sunlight from multiple directions, could be packed more closely together than traditional solar panels to generate more electricity per rooftop on an annual basis. It started deploying demonstration systems in 2006 and eventually installed over 1,000 systems worldwide which were generating nearly 100 megawatts of power. Solyndra's potentially game-changing technology attracted over $1 billion in venture capital funding and a $535 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy in 2009. But shortly afterwards, plunging silicon prices made conventional solar cells much more cost effective than Solyndra's CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide) thin film solar cells. By 2011, Solyndra declared bankruptcy and became a billion dollar flop. Better Place Better Place, a Silicon Valley company which ran most of its business in Israel, developed battery-charging and battery-switching services for electric vehicles. This was a forward-thinking concept, but it required entire countries to adopt its technology. The company initially established toeholds in Israel and Denmark, and it installed its first systems in a batch of Renault's Fluence Z.E. EVs. However, those programs were plagued by delays, and the company spent far too much money trying to run pilots in additional countries. In 2012, Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) launched its Supercharger network, which offered free charging (recently turned into a paid service) for Tesla owners. Energy giant NRG Energy also launched EVgo, a per-minute or per-hour EV charging service. These stations were built atop NRG's electric grids via partnerships with gas stations, restaurants, and convenience stores. It eventually became clear that Better Place couldn't hold a candle against these bigger rivals. In 2013, it declared bankruptcy after burning through all $850 million of its funding. Image source: Getty Images. Webvan Webvan, an online grocery delivery service, was founded in 1996. The company, which pledged to deliver products to customers' homes within 30 minutes, was initially popular and reached 10 major U.S. cities. Webvan attracted $800 million in funding with that growth and claimed that it could eventually reach 26 cities. The fatal flaw in Webvan's plan was that it tried to build its entire infrastructure of warehouses and delivery networks from scratch. It placed a $1 billion order from engineering company Bechtel to build state-of-the-art warehouses worth $30 million each. However, those infrastructure expenses completely outpaced the company's revenue growth, and it went bankrupt in 2001. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) eventually bought and resurrected the brand in 2009. However, Webvan's demise offered a valuable lesson to the tech companies expanding into grocery delivery services today -- to partner with brick-and-mortar stores instead of building warehouses from scratch. That's why AmazonFresh and Google Express now employ contracted drivers to deliver products from partnered grocers. Pets.com Pets.com, which was founded in 1998, sold pet supplies to customers over the internet. The idea, which seemed sound amid the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, attracted about $300 million in funding. But like Webvan, Pets.com never balanced its logistics expenses with adequate sales growth. Many pet supplies, like dog food and cat litter, were simply too heavy and expensive to ship. It made little sense to pay extra shipping costs and wait for deliveries when they could simply be purchased at a lower price from any supermarket. The company also failed to sell enough higher-margin products such as pet toys. Pets.com then resorted to steep discounts and aggressive marketing to attract customers, which resulted in an unsustainable cash-burn rate. During its first fiscal year, Pets.com spent a whopping $11.8 million on advertising, although it reportedly generated only $619,000 in revenue. By 2000, it ran out of money and is now remembered as the poster boy of dot-com failures -- thanks to its famous sock-puppet Super Bowl ad. Not all that glitters is gold These four costly failures indicate that start-ups often fumble a good idea with poor timing and management. Solyndra overestimated the appeal of its technology while underestimating the commoditization of the silicon solar cell market. Better Place flopped because it couldn't leverage the strength of a core business -- like Tesla's cars or NRG's electric grid -- to scale up its EV charging network. Webvan and Pets.com both failed because of logistics problems and undisciplined spending. But those failures also offered other tech companies valuable lessons. SolarCity (NASDAQ:SCTY), which now leases Solyndra's former manufacturing plant, is developing new high-efficiency silicon-based cells instead of using Solyndra's CIGS tech. Amazon, wary of the logistics issues which killed Webvan and Pets.com, has taken drastic steps -- such as installing robots in warehouses, signing air carrier agreements, and launching drones -- to keep expenses under control. Therefore, flops are inevitable, but they serve as a foundation for their successors to develop sustainable businesses upon.

Good luck in making Google reveal its algorithm The Guardian 2 days ago John Naughton © PA Publishing Google’s PageRank code is unlikely to make its workings much clearer to the public in general. On 25 October, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, wandered into unfamiliar territory – at least for a major politician. Addressing a media conference in Munich, she called on major internet companies to divulge the secrets of their algorithms on the grounds that their lack of transparency endangered public discourse. Her prime target appeared to be search engines such as Google and Bing, whose algorithms determine what you see when you type a search query into them. Given that, an internet user should have a right to know the logic behind the results presented to him or her. “I’m of the opinion,” declared the chancellor, “that algorithms must be made more transparent, so that one can inform oneself as an interested citizen about questions like, ‘What influences my behaviour on the internet and that of others?’ Algorithms, when they are not transparent, can lead to a distortion of our perception; they can shrink our expanse of information.” Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 106.65 +0.94 +0.89% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 58.92 +0.80 +1.38% Bank of America Corporation BAC ▼ 19.88 -0.21 -1.02% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▲ 31.73 +0.36 +1.15% As a slogan, 'transparency' sounds good. It gives one a warm feeling, even if it’s baloney All of which is unarguably true. We know that search results – and social media news feeds – are assembled by algorithms that determine the websites or news items likely to be most “relevant” for each user. The criteria used for determining relevance are many and varied, but some are calibrated by what your digital trail reveals about your interests and social network and, in that sense, the search results or news items that appear in your feed are personalised for you. But these powerful algorithms, which can indeed shape how you see the world, are proprietary and secret, which is wrong. So, Merkel argues, they should be less opaque. QED? Sadly, no. I hold no brief for Google or Facebook, but simply making their algorithms transparent would do more harm than good. The reason is that search results or news feeds could then be “gamed” by external operators whose objectives might be even more questionable – and would certainly be more opaque – than those of Google and Facebook. That doesn’t mean that the companies are squeaky clean, by the way. In fact, at the moment, the European commission is trying to decide if Google is abusing its monopoly of search to favour its own commercial interests. But at least we know what its motives are. On the other hand, if hackers of the Russian security service, say, were able secretly to manipulate your search results then you might conclude that transparency was overrated. As a slogan, “transparency” sounds good. Like the saying “sunlight is the best disinfectant”, it gives one a warm feeling, even if it’s baloney. But in the digital arena, at least, transparency is not necessarily the best way to achieve the accountability that Merkel rightly craves. Just imagine for a moment that she were able to compel Google to publish its PageRank algorithm, the one that decides which pages are most relevant to your search query. Once upon a time, when Google was conceived by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, PageRank was probably a fairly compact program. Now, it’s an amalgam of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of individual modules expressed as many thousands, perhaps millions, of lines of computer code. Publishing it might indeed enable hackers armed with the right tools to find exploitable weaknesses in the code, but it wouldn’t do much to help the average citizen to figure out if search results were being skewed in some sinister or unscrupulous way. So just publishing secret stuff doesn’t do the trick. In a way, this is the hard lesson that WikiLeaks learned. At the beginning, its animating philosophy was that if you published information that powerful and secretive organisations would prefer to keep private, then good things would happen. So WikiLeaks did indeed publish such material. But except in a few cases, nothing much happened, which is why, in the end, Julian Assange decided that the way forward was first of all to create editorial material such as the “collateral murder” video and, later, to team up with established journalistic outfits such as the Guardian, New York Times, Le Monde, El Pais and Der Spiegel to release a huge trove of US diplomatic cables. But the German chancellor has put her finger on an important problem. Decision-making algorithms are already shaping our culture, our commerce and maybe even our politics. For the most part, they are opaque and those who deploy them are therefore unaccountable. In the long run, this is intolerable – for liberty, privacy, equity and maybe even for democracy. The good news is that the problem is not insoluble. But there’s no single solution, no magic bullet. Calling for transparency won’t do it. Sometimes, publication will be the answer; at other times, it will be a muscular inspection regime, or need legislative changes to enforce legal liability. But before we can get started on solutions, we need first to acknowledge that we have a problem. So two cheers for Angela Merkel!

Take a closer look at these ten companies. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 13, 2016 at 10:00AM Driverless vehicles are often touted as the "next big thing" for both the tech and auto industries. But with so many companies making grand forecasts, it can be tough for investors to identify the true top brands in this fledgling market. Let's take a closer look at the top ten driverless brands, roughly ranked by their market reach. Google's prototype car. Image source: Google. 10. Ford In August, Ford (NYSE:F) CEO Mark Fields claimed that the automaker would mass produce fleets of driverless cars for a commercial ride hailing service by 2021. To do so, it's expanding its Palo Alto center and doubling its employee headcount. Ford also recently acquired Israeli start-up SAIPS, which specializes in computer vision technology that helps vehicles "see" obstacles, and invested in several other companies that develop driverless technologies. 9. Tesla Motors EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) gained a first mover's advantage in the semi-autonomous race with its Autopilot system. That system was recently implicated in a few fatal accidents, but it's continuously being improved with hardware and software updates. CEO Elon Musk recently announced that the company was building fully autonomous EVs powered by Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Drive PX2 platform, eight cameras, 12 updated sensors, and an upgraded radar. Musk believes that a fully autonomous Tesla vehicle could drive from L.A. to New York by the end of 2017. Tesla's Model S. Image source: Tesla. 8. Audi However, Volkswagen's Audi already completed a cross-country trip with an autonomous SQ5 last year. That vehicle was powered by Delphi's (NYSE:DLPH) driverless platform. Audi has also showcased other driverless vehicles like the A7, and claims that the next generation of its A8 sedan will be fully autonomous by 2017. Last December, Audi, Daimler, and BMW co-purchased the HERE mapping service from Nokia. Buying that platform, which is being upgraded from autonomous vehicles, enables the German automakers to address the privacy concerns which Google-controlled vehicles have raised. 7. Daimler Daimler chairman Dieter Zetsche believes that driverless vehicles could hit the market by 2025. That's a more conservative forecast, but the company has already been turning heads with its driverless Mercedes-Benz vehicles. It unveiled a driverless 18-wheeler in 2014, as well as a luxurious F 015 driverless concept sedan last year. The F 015 concept car. Image source: Mercedes-Benz. 6. Nvidia Nvidia's Tegra mobile SoCs (system on chips) power many infotainment and navigation systems in high-end vehicles. Nvidia is expanding deeper into that market with Drive PX, an onboard computer that powers autonomous vehicles. Tesla's new Autopilot system will use the second generation of that platform, PX 2. Nvidia also recently unveiled its next-gen Tegra "Xavier" SoC as an AI "supercomputer on a chip" for self-driving cars, and partnered with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and TomTom to develop new mapping systems for autonomous vehicles. 5. Alphabet Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has been testing out its driverless cars on public roads for several years. Those vehicles use LIDAR systems, which scan the surrounding environment in real-time while using a "high detail" version of Google Maps for navigation. Google wants automakers to ultimately produce driverless cars powered by its software platform, but that could be a tough sell due to the aforementioned privacy issues. 4. Baidu Baidu, the top search engine in China, has been testing out vehicles on public roads since last December. In April, it formed a driverless tech research center in Silicon Valley, with plans to eventually test driverless cars in the U.S. Baidu is outsourcing the production of its cars to Chinese automakers, and has stated that its first commercially available driverless vehicle -- a shuttle bus running on a pre-set loop -- will launch in China in 2018. 3. Mobileye Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) provides ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) to about 90% of leading automakers worldwide. These systems use cheaper technologies like cameras and radars to hit the brakes or sound alerts when obstacles are detected. Mobileye is leveraging that position to expand into autonomous vehicles with its EyeQ computer vision chips. The EyeQ brand suffered a setback this year when Tesla dropped its chipset from its Autopilot systems, but the chipmaker still maintains a strong first mover's advantage in the driverless market. 2. Delphi Automotive Delphi, one of the world's largest auto parts makers, also sells ADAS systems and autonomous solutions. Revenue from those businesses, which generated almost a fifth of the company's sales last quarter, has grown at double-digit rates over the past several quarters. As Delphi's automaker customers gradually upgrade to driverless vehicles, Delphi could gain tremendous bundling power by selling traditional auto parts with ADAS and autonomous solutions. Delphi also recently partnered with Mobileye to launch a fully autonomous vehicle system by 2019. Image source: Delphi. 1. Qualcomm Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world, will soon become the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world after its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors closes. That acquisition will combine NXP's automotive chips and BlueBox platform (which competes against Nvidia's Drive PX) with Qualcomm's Snapdragon Automotive chips and the IoT/automotive chips it acquired from CSR last year. That will make Qualcomm the 800-pound gorilla in connected cars, and allow it to gain substantial content share in autonomous vehicles in the future.

 Why two influential tech tycoons have fallen in love with a startup called Turbonomic Julie Bort Nov. 13, 2016, 10:00 AM 5,873 facebook linkedin twitter email print Bill Veghte, executive chairman of Turbonomic Bill Veghte, Tech veteran Bill Veghte, who's held executive positions at Microsoft and HP and been the CEO of SurveyMonkey, just emerged from his nearly year-long hiatus to announce his full-time job as executive chairman of a startup called Turbonomic. This was surprising news for a bunch of reasons. For one, it's fairly unusual for a startup to hire an executive director from outside the company as a full-time job unless it's part of a bigger management shakeup. For another, Turbonomic has already had a couple of big management shakeups and its ship appears to be sailing well now. Turbonomic turns the $5 billion network management market on its head. It uses a "supply and demand" model to automatically match an app with the exact amount of computing and storage capacity it needs, changing that capacity as the app's needs grow or shrink, with no human intervention needed. That's backwards from how this process typically works, where IT folks sort of guess at how much capacity an app needs, then use performance monitoring software to warn them when they need to tweak things. The company has had a number of management shaekups. Back in 2013, boardmember and VC investor Ben Nye took over as CEO on an interim basis. Then he stayed on permanently and tells us he has no intention of leaving now.  Since Nye took over, Turbonomic has been on a tear, Nye said. It's grown from 62 employees to 420, he said, and had 2015 revenue of $44.6 million, according to the Inc. 500 list of fastest growing private companies. Turbonomic currently has about 1,600 customers and has had 25 consecutive quarters of growth, Nye said.  Until about four months ago, Nye was both its CEO and a managing partner at Bain Capital Ventures. He's still at Bain as a VC but no longer managing the enterprise software investment practice that he founded. In terms of salary and pay, this was an expensive move, he jokes.  "I had to go back to partners at Bain and say, hey listen, I think this is big idea and I think I need to go do this. They were quite gracious. It was expensive economically. If anyone is paying to go to work, believe me, I am," he jokes. Digging in But he wanted to dig in  to the startup for two reasons. First, he felt an obligation to the people he hired as interim CEO, many who came to work with  Nye directly. Nye is a five-times Forbes Midas List VC who's backed successful companies like LinkedIn, DocuSign, SolarWinds, and Rapid7.  The second is the same reason that he convinced Veghte to join. They are both blown away by the technology created by founders Shmuel Kliger and Yuri Rabover. Bain Capital VC and Turbonomic CEO Ben Nye Bain Capital "When someone takes a space you know well and all of the sudden they twist it and show it to you a new way, a little dopamine goes off in your head and you think, oh my god, this is going to be huge," Nye said. "But these guys don’t know much about the financial side, or marketing side, and then you say, ok, I can help them with this."   He believes Turbonomic is solving a real and urgent need that can help companies save significant money. "The average data center is more than 50% over-provisioned," says, meaning that companies buy and run far more computers and storage than they really need just to make sure their apps work well.  For instance, one of the company's biggest clients now uses 775 terabytes fewer of memory and 2500 terabytes fewer of storage in just in two data centers, just by automatically right-sizing its apps, Nye says.  Turbonomic also works on clouds like Amazon Web Services and Google.  In fact, this kind of automation is the big selling point for Google's App Engine cloud. And Google's automation tech came from a startup called Stackdrivers, a company Nye backed and sold to Google. Looking his children in the eye As for Veghte joining the company, that's another signal that Turbonomic is one to watch. Veghte has been in the tech industry for three decades, cutting his teeth during the early years at Microsoft building products like Windows and Office. Then he ran HP's enterprise business and, as its COO, helped mastermind its split into two companies. He was also briefly CEO at SurveyMonkey, replacing one his friend Dave Goldberg after Goldberg's tragic death. But he quit the CEO job and went back to the SurveyMonkey board early this year, citing a difference of opinion on strategy. Google He's spent the last few months traveling the world and checking out everything from startups to VC roles, he told Business Insider, and could have gone anywhere. But, unlike his short-lived CEO role at SurveyMonkey, which was competing in an unfamiliar market, Turbonomic's tech is 100% in Veghte's wheelhouse. And Nye lobbied hard to get him to join.  While at Microsoft, he helped to create System Center, the monitoring software that Turbonomic now competes with.  Veghte says that this type of old-fashioned software created "a freakin' hairball" out of today's data centers. Turbonomic not only fixes, but can help save the planet by allowing companies to use less data center equipment — meaning less energy. After taking time off, he realized he can't fix all the world's problems, but he loves technology and knows how to do build it. "I can make the world a better place by building great technologies that use a lot less carbon emissions, so I can look my children in they eye," he says.
