They debate whether some B's fans are being unfair or if their worries have a basis in reality. The two also discuss the sudden belief that some people at the station have, in that the Celtics are ready to take down the Cavaliers. You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. News piece mud at night. This felt it better than the cavaliers right down the Washington Wizards are better team. And they catalyst right now I think this golf its hand. The crowd and they get at least in the play out there may well then again when I thought it would. Ali shell. I was still living in the hands of the fans that they covered because of the 2000 it's producing. Getting to imagine that's why it took the earth like anything like that desert Star Wars. Here's Mike at night on Sports Radio W. And tonight we officially answer the question my Anke Sports Radio WEEI rich desert seed because I think there's about a hundred desert theme does desert city in the first three Star Wars movies I've not seen the most recent ones that Oprah would reforming. A spoiler thank you very much it's desert. That the legacy does it and we'll do it doesn't get active kids I can't it's tough to get out to a movie at this age okay I apologize to give it seven adds I'm not single. Radio producer with hours and hours of time on my hands OK that's there is the worst thing ever heard. But I it's not excuse that's not true you've heard words back here at last three hours. There when I just said debate between elements entering. Yelling back and forth but you're talking they'll hone Keyes show no no no no matter every place is absolutely not some up towards. I keep it Cyril. We're till 7 o'clock we'll talk to you guys and rob will join us at 8 o'clock 7 o'clock tonight. I'll find out which deserts he was alluding to when he's getting choked out by DO windy weather man there and for my dusty. 61777979837. The phone a beacon Texan as well. At 379837. On Twitter at Mott and UT WEEI and keep when he won't get to the Celtics and these blazing Celtics take today for Ali glad. I'll start with the news that you guys broke during your show and that's insane McEntire bruins' backup goaltender. Headed back to Providence and boy are headed up from Providence on an emergency basis yeah. Led by the charger rich Keefe the took a rest pitchforks were outright full four out of you you. Rob you're hoping now that Google was knocked in a plate Leah because I was I have to openly says that 2 or 3 o'clock we're only supposed to start there's still time and then when you see this in MacIntyre and vague aegis you jump there he's there oh my god. They didn't want to the first time. It would not into you called fluke that went into the third time there's that many times in the course of his anger factor in the Olympics and yeah I well I. That's my arguments that yes I well. So I thought there's a Chancy to this guy really do this again and one of the biggest and every game now as it is a huge game for the biggest game of the year was on Saturday where he could go he said on Friday could ago. But it looks like he will play tonight there's still a lot of pressure yes he has the played well here gold for but it looks like I was I was wrong. When I said maybe it was bagged out you're not the only. Once John Hagerty who is on the beat basically took to Twitter it's hard speculating that up it's like to grasp knack it to be able to go ya. And about five minutes later here comes the Conway over the top saying no it's for Anton who -- so the hell happened there it okay if you want Shockley can look at hacks that their hacks that had expansions on social media around arrogant after mile critical of the hacks are missing that stored but I think he speaks a lot of experience and Inverness is in front and center that. He sort of hoping that took is salt that's weird this is. The Bruins fan base that wants a team to make the playoffs I guess wants them to. Be good down the stretcher and qualify. Their recognition that the only do that on the back of two grass in that mean it's not if zealot who Dalton for the next hour and hours on those last five all come to a close violence and says arguably the hot goalies it's hot goal no don't get me at hello this time no I don't I'd I'd in this weird thing it's called best goal. And you look at the goals against I'm looking they've set out eight it looked great this year but he also played a million minutes early in the year he's hurt. And he's not well we need all of Easter implants ace insert into Cassidy and is now back his coach is back to that was the weird thing there it is coach when out of his way to have his back like that make a lot of sense of all the sun today. He wasn't gonna stark is Cassie was like four. He's our number one no question about it Rask units it yesterday I feel fine also ripped them after the Tampa game more bodies are anybody which is okay. Well OK I wanted to and it did that have anything to do with the now playing on Saturday like didn't do anything to him every little subsidize it thanks coach. You're took him our our defense and our rates and higher change in the style slower or more offensive minded team. Believe me back there to make only saves and haggard and blaming. But it wasn't thrown about do you think they have as much likelihood of a making whenever run the gonna make I don't think you're gonna make any Iran by the way out. With and on who build and it's their number one and Rask is none out RO I would say number when I was I would ride out the hot hand that's odd I would I I'm not hurting the team over I don't know him uncle young high school. The global hawk eye is classified in Google Google. That's right now would opens but what that hot vs cold we'll see tonight you you know we'll see with not so healthy Tuukka Rask is finer he's got one out for the team but it as the as the avalanche of anger is comforts to guy and I'm standing by in 1000% you want to go back next year I won it yesterday I want Arcsight the other options in free agency while ago I got a great not mayor it's only guys available out there is that Steve Mason lot of guys that you'd say to gaze better than right now you know I don't I don't have a well a lot of passion for to grab your teams and about to open. But I do think it's kind of weird that effort a fan base wants him to make a run. You want the backup to keep getting games and that's what Beckham's winning is the easiest thing to mocked it or did it in hockey right it's. It's the gold and it's it is the easiest you don't need to focus amount for any tell you what team is three in a row Ellis has got any idiot can go all yeah it's a goalie yeah backup backup goaltenders about a quarterback as starting quarterbacks are to scuffle what does everyone do us all our policy Michael bishop yeah. One additional shot all night because he's raised metaphor for days passed up playing right now that makes sense that. That's what you back a gold backup quarterback and starting gold. Do you backup and he's been terra early in the year if this is going on when it was MacIntyre Soo bad it got a crack at it or it would open the nobody is gone for the backup and raskin had 56 bad games in a row but nobody want the backup I'm saying it now there's no way. It held that that grass is better than it open but right now for tonight's game I was saying you know yesterday that it should have been. Who go and it's not it's gonna it's gonna be Tuukka and and hopefully he wins and hopefully that that it starts a hot streak for him would limit the plant. We start there because that's the news tonight obviously make you wait to check on the Bruins tonight it will be looks like as of now to grass get that changes around 630 years of the next update we get will certainly pass that along but it appears. MacIntyre is up not for Coca. Not for fluke is rich keep calling you look at but for Anton who opened. I would I've I've always puzzles saw myself as it out this Colorado this just play this is all atlas and Rask thought about it let's get out front of that. That allegedly tacky I. Back at all that are not available that does things and the like now he says he's not starting in what is the palace that now he's at the camp play he can't back up to. The packets at Washington that's OK I catch. Let's get Zain I can't sit in this great anymore I want so if there's any update between now and drop of the puck around 7 o'clock we'll pass along but it seemed like to caress connected the to the aggravate the difference in the back for some reason the start tonight. And is a China plate with injury is they take on the islanders as the other team that occupies the building over there at the guard this has been. What what what a turn of events here among. Facing in Celtics fans. But the big basketball guys England or wait and Michael Holley listen to extensively. On the station that was in every show on the C sheets from my own. You're on W we you have to look at air check no I probably should Elizabeth thanks that probably should take its cyber about it as we don't signaled the players it's very fair as it makes advocates as I have wasted hours went with the yourself. I popped up that would not be motivated now to duke it takes a higher uttered the words of mud deep backs watts planet a strong open. Good line honored great monologue excellent start of this trio. By average review gala event. Because you hear one hell wants listen and then one more mile ultra ultra I've coach appreciate you our guys are like our market out there he players now to help out Tom Brady in the last couple years agrees with like well like would be all of the data that was explains it he plays the 45 mark and one of the say yes. All will get that that is a part of that showed that at some point by its its that would lower weight today it's morally sound Horry. My guideline or waigel and battling in the final four I can't WE I host bracket at that testing later on in this hour top loss rich keep my guy. OKO old ass or way yapping away today about the Celtics in making the case that that he can think of object. Do you agree that it Cleveland's number two seed big and still win because it's the least I know hard and I don't expect him he's still one yes well I don't win. I think it gets applause I think they said it's not right now I would say hello Lou. I don't think winning these route guidance is Erica and you've got to. It's gonna win needs that adds Lou what instantly as I can. Loop the now. I don't think he was he's been up for debate Cleveland is been holed render its dome since the all star break. Hall renders them they had been the worst defensive team in the league and she says steele's at it does men now is Glen manor. And Lou Lou Lou Lou and it's classic that is out of the more we radio playbook don't quite. Say this is gonna win the Eastern Conference final event it's icky sweet straddles that fence like a street caddies portrait on Hannity never balls all out he's right down the middle. And what he's saying is that Cleveland you eat what he saw last night. The Cleveland Cavaliers who got their asses blown out yeah okay. My it's good. It was a good visual commented sixth nineteen say that that. They got blown out LeBron got shot it was one of the biggest how Madonna is okay. Eighties it it's it's getting to a point where with LeBron James he can do this all wants the regular season we can Marcum but he is 31 comeback last year it's tough to make fun of him. All the icon but they got blown out they've not played well the one of the vet the worst defensive teams in a the NBA since the all star break and the second worst thing the lakers of the worst defensive team us the all star break and they are tanking to a desperately in that top three. They did lawns a ball netted the first round. Our verses the cavaliers who aren't you trying to play trying to lock in the number one seed but appeared just sort of bored by itself. He would not say apple will we just are there and I can tell it's gonna play now he's in what I heard was in Tel me if I'm making something up. I heard glands and the Celtics can are gonna beat the cavaliers in eastern conference on. I heard it more say the cavaliers are not a lock to win the east bunker and I and whether the Celtics the wizards are the raptors. I feel like he thinks somebody else can win he would take the field as we've said yeah. And and so that's sort of the we've brought up an afternoon show and Michael is for a long time. One of the field it's so the field and I was sort of switch it to the field to just beat the Celtics he thinks they're the best of the field. I I know Cleveland looked bad. And they've been in that game last night. Against what could potentially BA finals previewed he's got embarrassed yet that LeBron wanted to eat tapped out of the game needed. And so that that is an ugly scene for the cavs but its regular season LeBron regular season caps. That's right they're not the same in the post at least that's how I at that towel I look at the exact same way you say that's pretty much the same team from a year ago they added some pieces who who knows how much they'll help like Kyle Korver. The the corpse of Deron Williams and some other things like put their starters of the same. And whatever series therein in the Eastern Conference they're gonna have the best player in in my mind the second best player and I think carrier Irving is is that good. Kevin Love seven a good year you missed atomic games below those guys a playoff. Format I just I don't see the Celtics beating the taps for time. I agree let's hear from New York your tag team partner Michael Holley who admittedly is done this a little bit he is -- Dennis for longer than most people are heard how vulnerable the cavs are for a long time with knocks the cavaliers not sure does exactly the cut generation bash your first but not only did holly speculate on the Celtics when Easter conference today. He's deputies on the warrant the NBA finals and started making the case for an Eastern Conference team or Western Conference seabees into the same boat of the cavaliers being vulnerable. The Celtics better than the cavaliers right now the Washington Wizards are better team than they cavaliers right now I think the Celtics can. Beat the count as they can easily add in the playoffs. It may well they can win. It. He is you don't expect it to the scene and later on eat it you were sitting there with them and I give you credit for not just. Total lost it when he started on the Celtics now as NBA finals on competitor and here I can win the finals not only the Eastern Conference I don't think they're gonna all be golden state of the San Antonio or beat whoever gets out of the western copper by the Western Conference is. Yours better in the Eastern Conference he did at least three title contenders beast has once it's 31. West vs economic knowledge in the Eastern Conference. They can win the NBA bought. What world are we living in folks and now here's a back and win a playoff series. Parts of the great I loved the way this topic team plays I really enjoy the coach I enjoy the players. The fans create one of the better home. Court environments in the NBA there's very little Vatican say about the Celtics except for this in the playoffs. They have yet to win a series with this group and now we are doing this thing. Where we ignore history history says you don't just all of a sudden a much of the Celtics in 2008. Would a veteran team go from not winning in the post season to winning a championship you don't do it that he met KG Paul Pierce right Allen Doc Rivers. Bloated a veteran presence in both he ought to all the bench guys who had been there in the post season. This team here to sell the team. Couldn't get out of it last year although a different team the players they acquired Al Horford I wouldn't call him a great. Playoff player we saw and experienced a year I don't everybody's spot rate setters like what is guys battle tested. Oh sees no news terrible if the Celtics last year and down around point mocked him there in the post please dollars last year I think that the finger you have to point out is. I'm two years ago Atlanta had the best record in the Eastern Conference in May won the east by seven game. Over the cavs and then they got swept out by Cleveland. In the conference final loan out not competitive you go back into these two of those four games back to Miami man in the last year Miami. The Indiana Pacers were actually the number one seed and they took him to six games they took the heat that was but LeBron still get a browser the last six finals. I don't see maybe I I know I'll give you this it's more competitive. This year like the Celtics wizards and raptors. Are better than the second third fourth best teams in the east the last two years took to get tougher road to the finals for Cleveland this year. But there they're still the team there it's it should still be. Cleveland vs the field in Cleveland has better off the last time they LeBron led Eastern Conference team did not get today NBA finals was in 2010. Right that we on the this last year a Cleveland right. Olive first Arab or went to Miami and yet that's helping veterans helping Tina on Sunday and in the bronze times photos they quit yeah I've I used to play ball now on standby. And he that was and that's it other that is used mentioned 6 Eastern Conference finals in a row that's the first advice that's the first evidence that would used for we are goal weight too far win. The cavs look Ballmer I think they've got some flaws I think that it's well right now I don't look that. Load though left. Mama what's a father knock on the regular season like eight who who let's play game best played Eastern Conference the project second best when he's a conference call George. Got you. No I think Kyra again at both top sports teams I think carrier I loved how we are all close as we get a draft and you took Paul George second I'd still taking carrier ring third if you wanna take Kyra seconds they have two of the three best players. In the Eastern Conference. They that the rebounding thing that people wanna sort of ignore is still there the three games they've played this year here at the rebounding margins thirty to 4939. Cleveland. 4629. Cleveland at at Ted awful overtime loss for the Celtics outrebounded by almost twenty and then. Thankfully 4741. Celtics actually out rebounded cavaliers. In their last game any playoff series. They'll be dominate on the inside purchased and yeah I will dominate them on the tears right exactly and I think I think. They they sort of be the greatest offensive team the come playoff time they'll be better retiree and the and Kevin Love certainly aren't. Great defensive players they have other guys that can do it LeBron when he wants to can do it. They've done an iced out the last couple years in the finals against Currie Siegel imagine what they could throw. Pat Isiah Thomas so yeah I'm not gonna. They don't look great but you know at the last couple years they win in the fifties that they're not a team that wins but that that always Celtics won 66 regular season games that drop in the case with a with Cleveland since Bronson about. I don't think their. The focus is not the regular season they unlike the Celtics the vacant they can still win it Eastern Conference final. If theater to see the Celtics definitely can't and I can when we're the one or the cute is this fight for the number one seed is a nice story but. It's it's more about winning a playoff series were to I don't care where. Oddly finish I don't care what their their final record is it they got to find a way to advance in the first round and we're wired hobbled out where we're at it more to do instead. They're going to be the cavaliers these conference filed that or the NBA finals at its is. Weird thing now where in 2017. You probably noticed that wants social media anywhere else happened today in dogma of the Celtics. We wanna hand outs superlatives. Like their candy Halloween. Everything is the greatest everything is the worse I love that I hate that that's great at it it's too with a Celtic team. I feel like we're doing and puts I think cavaliers they show a little bit of vulnerability don't play well are over a couple of weeks into. Just over a month and now work. It ignore history and say a teen is not won a playoff series now is gonna put it together and go past the LeBron do you. These just I'm not trying to there now well known non. I can't do that and I I'm just curious that. Where where is is coming from these people love the Celtics or is this more of a an anti LeBron. Anti Cleveland well I hope so but yeah but it's about the big Cleveland Cavaliers being bold but didn't see. I sort of get where they're coming from in the sense that the Celtics I don't if you're a fierce politics that I get tired so it's been a year and this is at a mall for the fan bases. All in a lot of overlap and about the four teams. Seems like Celtics handled a more optimistic. Less pessimistic right. With a Red Sox here over them for whatever even the patriots that a lot of people wrote an emperor for Jamie columns of certain moves that are ruins of course we've been doing it for for months now. The Celtics because this turnaround is happening a lot quicker than you anticipated. Now all of a sudden you wake up and they're in first place. The top of the standings right now in the east and you're probably already giving more credit than they deserve. And a month ago or two months ago and now when they're in the first place in UC Cleveland. On national television lay down and die against the spurs last night you're saying the minute. Good luck. Why can't they be him utter a group that I'm guessing that's part of where Michael water and I'm curious. I it's not just Michael and once I heard the nostrils all day at a scene Celtic fans on social media making the case for their team the question is you make in the case because. The Celtics are so good this year or. Is that the vulnerability of Cleveland it's more people anti LeBron want to see LeBron. Get me through all the way he's in the NFL not in the patriots. Wanna see Tom Brady get the throne. I'm in the AFC east 617779. 7937. The phone we start Celtics I would you guys get your calls coming up at 6177797937. You can text and as well. 379. B 37. We'd dance of the final four in the best WEEI host bracket. I'll we'll get to the final four in about fifteen minutes from now voting is now open it WEEI dot com slash whats the point on a sign up and win a we'll tell you about that will start out with the Celtics tonight their push for the number one seed. And the NBA finals now we heard today but Inky Sports Radio W media. More with Mike magnets he had which keeps. On Sports Radio WEEI. Here's. Lot of nice portrait you WEEI average keys in the house could you update on the WEEI best throws Brack toward idol finals for the crown night. Sometime Thursday or Friday your phone calls starting Celtics tonight in the an increase buzz about this team not only winning a playoff round or 2 but it Eastern Conference final knocking off the cavaliers that. Attention and NBA final as the as Michael Holley split mentioned this afternoon really solid really dreaming about run against the Western Conference Miguel's in April. On the Celtics roster first up on mud at night and Miguel. They unorganized the mental you. Couldn't I support don't relate to marry. But first ordered the proud of general green and I'm wondering what the Celtics are white paper took it a night you know as much because he can be prettier richer and the score we normally let it and that's our report the automaker but I thought we release that are predictive but we're beyond any or. And out and other problems although the rate of vehicles like we are right. You know connection so late. Sports you have one of what went about hobbies let Wear out and stretched wide. We'll talk about what kind of contradictory. Considering the fact that what he would they were all four people and afterward unity brigade but we might wipe out problem. I remember. Are aren't about a book about it. What well I Miguel get yourself it's point a sec let's start with the the FaceBook news. I try to avoid Facebook's much possible yes aka I definitely avoid a any Facebook's. Sponsored news I don't like adds I would not he had need to be ads that said. Club Caroline who's broke yet it is recent couple athletes is JJ watt was one of them and Brady JJ watt broken it was a sponsored you know click bait type of things Mike guesses with the capita element pretend to know. A ball cap critics love life parents separate Cisco now. But that smells like gay hate please please click here to get on cap Riddick is now popular in the news and if people are searching for knuckle on his FaceBook agreed that would wouldn't worry about that some supposed day for FaceBook and my wife is a safer and having faced the impressive. As for Gerald Green and he came in here is a bad score that's pretty much. What he's been for this team when he's played he's limited when he what do you we can score off the invention in spurts we need some help you down by ten points in the third quarter getting it. I try to get some scoring going that's what is rolls. I think to win when the team's healthy he candidates squeezed out of the rotation spot where as when they were missing Avery Bradley for numbered games or whoever else. Was out that'd be more times to bring in Jerrold greed but if the whole team is healthy. He's our he's I don't know when you're eight or nine best guys know I don't think he'd be part of a playoff rotation here now BA you know break classic case emergency guy or where doubt at some point in trying to get back offensively but it did this is good for the Celtics but other players like rose year end. I Jalen brown as a rookie. I'm guys like I mean you didn't he do anything this year right and he's a month he's a much better option then then on Gerald bull in the post season he would definitely be part of a Brad Stevens or patient right now. I don't think I wouldn't say Joseph greens are locked too to have that happen at this point. The moral story stay away from FaceBook news yes on Connor a car on the Celtics icon. They got that we don't love the show thanks I just want to call eight get to take on what you guys think. If the south that you had in the playoffs at all to see they get better early exit. Now kind of what they're played at our unit at about trade and they are about a part of it is I think it would do enough. Connor it's an awesome question and it's it it's probably a bigger question. In terms of what is next for the Celtics you know what's the next phase hot they get from where they are now. Which is a nice. It's Allison nice that's all that's the meeting today it is it's it's a good team not a great team. This still lacking that really great great great player that he seemed to needle if you're gonna go the three or four really really good players like other teams have done adds it's few and far between now how do you go from where they are now rich. That next step what they get it was an as confirmation was the first round or second round two gets almost secondary it's after the season in general. What is that next step right that's going to be higher offseason Abbas talking about this. Did you get a top ten player or you have to weigh in my desktop simpler and commute to E*Trade for one or sign one or the other thing is. Jalen brown Marcus Smart in some of the young guys you have on the team have to develop into being superstars of the whoever you get with the nets pick coming up in the draft. I know that's oral longer play that's what's gonna talk because here they are some folks Michael Glenn included think big compete for title right now. So did you wanna maximize. On match. Com because if not it might not all lineup Braylon Isiah Horford. A couple of the guys may not be. Still on their prime when your draft pick in Jalen brown of those guys are because there are entering their pride shall never lined up perfectly where you truly are. A title contender that's the sad for the bouncer now in effect it's ironic. Brought up what is next because really we're not gonna know in fact of the eight weeks and tonight Tuesday night may sixteenth is the NBA draft lottery. And so that is going to. AD TL a lot going for to what's gonna happen for them if they somehow end up with a number one overall pick. That is either mark health Fultz it's one's old ball. Or is rich talked about trading for most players you only trade one of those guys these marquee guys who might be available. If you get that number one epic is very unlikely if you fall out of number one or at an Odyssey number to beat I think. Ball ball ball Fultz I guess it's they wanted to that one incident but Josh Jackson and that next group players after that doesn't get you least in my mind right now. Doesn't get you that premium player you just talked about automated lesson number one less of a shore thing I mean you look across the best players in the league right now and Ronald number one and number two picks obviously but. Much more of chance are less of a chance of its but the best way to convince eighteen to trade that established already. Is going to be if you can promise them mark health Fultz or lines of all. It was the right out of Jackson that that next group of players after that general. And I did not done the deep dive yet money NBC or fox or Dennis Smith anchor Jonathan Isaac. So those guys are not in that top tier of faults and all right. It lets those out those who have cleared of the believe wrestle line in terms of yeah an incredibly although. Who's the savage false that it may determine who's hurt lawns a ball out of that last game so maybe monk and fox are moving up there in India between now in the draft there's going to be a big change. Anyway but effort throughout the entire season both against the top two guys and then. David Jackson and and sort of pick whoever you like after that. Yeah it's it it that's. The caller brings it up it's tough that to talk about a lot right now the picture on the verge of potentially the number one seed right here on the verge of hopefully winning a playoff series with this group. But that is the next question how to they go from where they are now to where I'm San Antonio. Cleveland. Pot of gold states are once in lifetime you know what they are doing right now all that talent but in that group a teams that. When they roll up the balls and open at the NBA. Your team is so good. That your that conversation when NBA championship the Celtics were not there to start the year. And in most case I'll think nationally rich they're being considered locally some people get all excited dealt them Dahlia getting there but nationally. They're not the conversation good coach good team. Not a great roster right now is how you very good yes I estimates may not exhibit it's not and that group of these surrogate. It's a great. There's different it's Al Horford roster it's a very good ride Al Horford is a very good player as they plot is a very good roster yesterday they don't you don't when Bolton with a B plus team and the profit and and and you've talked about extensively. The hardest thing now to do is go from the B plus roster to the roster via as the only indicates you. The next level. Is that star player and an athletic tenable as cops and how they have ambushed a million more couples that guy you draft him or E*Trade for other that you know. Not get free agency is not been kind to your Boston Celtics free to not knocking on the door to shall open players so Pete plus rosters are good. But that next step is Connor pointed out we the next up big storyline for the sell the team after whatever they do here in the post I don't wanna walk past that I don't wanna. Start the show tonight by sane people are crazy to call the Celtics a championship contender this year. Now pointing out their good team they're fun team entertaining team eight likable team. That nothing bad about the celtics' other than this idea that. You now now can sleep and got blown out knee scuffled in the second half that and and pretend. But the Celtics beat the cavaliers in seven games all the now too and this is for for Michael Glenn specifically but if the Celtics lose. In the second thing is that even in the conference finals but they lows in the second round. They should kill the Celtics yet because you either in the south are there L yet they could even win yet either of them went around to throw that went around they should this absolutely beat Miami or Indiana where they put the first round. But that's thousand step bows looking to take. And then maybe it'll be more than everything after that to me. For this season would be gravy but if you're saying finals are fine at all. All right then you have to get after they don't and that second round for me is a little bit or matchup dependent if they catch Toronto with a healthy Kyle Lowry back that's tough they're big that the bit. Ruptured better team they wound up mock another piece of the trade deadline to their better with helping Kyle our date so beat them knights have held a series win. If they catch Washington that second round. They should now be that Washington. So the matchup dependent thing for me but if they if they lose to Miami or bill war and a first round yeah out here forget it 617779. 7937. The phone numbers starting Celtics here tonight the expectations. Of this team more about the Celtics are more about the cavaliers the way they have played recently or get your phone calls and we come back the final four voting is now open it. It's a bracket for the people to WEEI best post bracket we have a final four we'll tell you about a height can vote and what you can win it that's next here on WEEI.

Now, they've put much of it in one easy-to-find place along with the company's own open-source philosophy. By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Linux and Open Source | March 29, 2017 -- 02:10 GMT (19:10 PDT) | Topic: Enterprise Software Google lives and dies on open-source software. Without Linux, there would be no Google. The company both uses and makes open-source code every day of the year. In 2017 alone, Google has open-sourced Chrome for iOS; Upspin file-sharing; E2EMail, experimental end-to-end email encryption; and the Guetzli JPEG encoder. There's only one problem. How do you find all these projects? Google finally has given us the answer: Google Open Source Projects. Google's made it easy to find almost all their open-source code. In a blog post, Will Norris, a software engineer at Google's Open Source Programs Office, wrote: "Free and open-source software has been part of our technical and organizational foundation since Google's early beginnings. From servers running the Linux kernel to an internal culture of being able to patch any other team's code, open source is part of everything we do. In return, we've released millions of lines of open-source code, run programs like Google Summer of Code and Google Code-in, and sponsor open-source projects and communities through organizations like Software Freedom Conservancy, the Apache Software Foundation, and many others." Tech giants court retailers chasing omnichannel dream Technology vendors are using a gloomy backdrop to pitch omnichannel, analytics and the Internet of things as magic bullets vs. Amazon. Read More And now, 18 years after Google was founded, Google has launched opensource.google.com. This site "ties together all of our initiatives with information on how we use, release, and support open source". Why is Google doing this? To quote the site, "Google believes that open source is good for everyone. By being open and freely available, it enables and encourages collaboration and the development of technology, solving real world problems." Sounds good to me. This is not a source-code site, such as GitHub. Instead, it's a master directory to Google's open-source projects. For example, "We don't know which projects will find an audience, so we help teams release code whenever possible," continued Norris. "As a result, we have released thousands of projects under open-source licenses ranging from larger products like TensorFlow, Go, and Kubernetes to smaller projects such as Light My Piano, Neuroglancer and Periph.io. Some are fully supported while others are experimental or just for fun. With so many projects spread across 100 GitHub organizations and our self-hosted Git service, it can be difficult to see the scope and scale of our open-source footprint." But, it's more. Norris explained that it's a "look under the hood at how we 'do' open source". When Norris says that, he means it. "Today we are publishing our internal documentation for how we do open source at Google." This is essential reading for any company wanting to use open-source software development to its fullest potential. Or, anyone who wants to know how big companies handle open source. Specifically, "These docs explain the process we follow for releasing new open-source projects, submitting patches to others' projects, and how we manage the open-source code that we bring into the company and use ourselves. But in addition to the how, it outlines why we do things the way we do, such as why we only use code under certain licenses or why we require contributor license agreements for all patches we receive." Like I said, this is essential reading for companies and developers working with open source. Which, by the way, is pretty much everyone these days. As Jim Zemlin, the Linux Foundation's executive director, has said, "Open source will be the new Pareto Principle." By that, he meant 80 percent of technology value -- whether from smartphones, TVs, or IT -- will be coming from open-source software development, with only 20 percent coming from proprietary programming. He was on to something. By 2015, 78 percent of companies were running open-source software. You will be too soon. Actually, if you use Google for search, or just about anything else, you're already using it.

Periscope, which at one point in the not so distant past, was the go to place for live streaming is in need of a new inflow of cash. But perhaps more interesting than the ads themselves is the way Twitter plans on giving advertisers some say on where their ads end up. Although always a contentious topic, ads have recently become a thorny subject in light of recent events involving YouTube and Google. Some companies, including Verizon and AT&T have pulled out their ads, and their money, off Google’s video streaming platform. The reason? Because some of those pre-roll ads ended up in videos with anti-Semitic and questionable content. While Google is still busy putting out fires from this PR mess, Twitter is offering those brands a new home. Although perhaps not as widespread as YouTube, Periscope is still a popular live streaming platform. On top of that, Twitter is offering advertisers something Google so far hasn’t: more control. Twitter’s solution to the can of worms that YouTube opened up is to let advertisers choose where their ads appear in the first place. It will present a selection of content publishers that it knows are more or less respectable and brands can choose among those instead of having their video pre-roll ads appear almost randomly on anyone’s live stream. Because of its popularity, YouTube doesn’t really have complete control over what gets uploaded there. Even from well-known and “sponsored” publishers, like the now notorious PewDiePie.

Photo by Ellery Biddle HAVANA, Cuba -- “Cuba slashes Internet costs” … “Cuba signs deal with Google for faster internet access” … “Will Cuba embrace the Internet revolution?” These recent headlines from AFP, Al Jazeera and BBC, respectively, paint a picture of a society that after nearly six decades of dictatorship and nearly two of “digital isolation”, is finally bursting onto the global Internet scene. But the articles that follow, all published by reputable news organizations, offer a much more sobering and realistic image of a country where Internet access is fleeting, connection quality is poor, and the costs of getting online are astronomical. Another recent example came from an Associated Press article that bore the headline: “Cuba sees explosion in internet access as ties with US grow.” The Spanish version of the same article, published on the same day, offered a different and much more accurate version of the story with this headline: “Cuba has unique ways of getting online”. Screenshots of English and Spanish versions of Andrea Rodriguez's AP story. “The Spanish headline plainly introduces the topic of focus; the English version does something very different.” Written by Associated Press’ Andrea Rodriguez, who is originally from Argentina and has worked in the AP Havana bureau for more than ten years, the piece offered a well-researched description of the pilot, including a series of detailed anecdotes about the different ways Cubans get online or use networked technologies for work, education and communicating with friends and family. It also points to a new state telecommunications program that will allow Cubans to pay for at-home Internet connections for either $15 or $115 per month, for 30 hours of service. The texts of the story versions in English and Spanish mirror one another -- this is a direct translation. But while the Spanish headline plainly introduces the topic of focus, the English version does something very different, likely reflecting the work of a web editor whose primary concern is to attract readers. Perhaps headlines need a little more pizazz if they want to capture English-language audiences -- a purported explosion in Internet use would surely attract clicks from Cuba-curious Americans. And in keeping with other recent headlines on tech in Cuba, the headline on the English version of the AP story supports the idea that Cuba's renewed ties with the US may be helping to drive the island's would-be “Internet revolution.” Since the December 2014 rapprochement between the US and Cuba, US media outlets have buzzed with intrigue about the perceived role and uses of technology in what remains a mysterious country for many Americans. Silicon Valley companies like Google, AirBnB and Netflix have experienced impressive PR bumps from stories that essentially say “our services are now accessible in Cuba.” Some US media coverage of these developments is sensational, but innocuous. And some of it is outright misleading. “Google signs deal to bring faster Internet to Cuba” In late 2016, when Google began offering caching for Google sites in Cuba -- a standard service worldwide for users to access Google sites like Gmail and YouTube -- multiple major media outlets ran a Reuters story with headlines boasting that the Google agreement would improve Internet access wholesale, including the above from Al Jazeera. (To Reuters’ credit, their original headline focused on the agreement and made no mention of “better Internet.”) When Google partnered with Havana artist and Cuban Communist Party loyalist Kcho to create a new access opportunity at the artist's studio on the outskirts of Havana, global media flattered the company with headlines like “Google helps offer vastly faster Internet in Cuba” and “Google opens state-of-the-art technology studio in Cuba”. Yet from what I could see, and from what various employees at Kcho's studio told me when I visited the place last year, it appears that Google essentially gave them 20 Acer Chromebooks, 20 Google cardboard sets and a generous set of promotional materials, including several prominent “Google + Kcho” flags that adorn the otherwise advertisement-free roadway outside the art space. The studio itself has existed for several years, and the WiFi connection was opened to the public by Kcho, with the government's blessing, in 2015. The connection, contrary to (later corrected) reports of a whopping 70 megabytes per second download speed, is not especially fast. “How the Netflix move will help Cubans” In my own experience writing on these topics, I've struggled with editors at various reputable news and policy organizations who seem determined to put forth a narrative about the US “saving” Cuba with technology, even when the story I've written doesn't support this idea at all. When Elaine Diaz and I wrote about the irony of Netflix launching services in a country where Internet connectivity is fleeting and no one has a credit card, we were glad to see the story republished by US outlets, in accordance with Global Voices Creative Commons license, which allows for headline changes. But when we saw the piece republished with headlines like “How the Netflix move will help Cubans,” we realized that the actual story was no match for the power of the “Cuban Internet revolution” trope. This and other US media coverage of the recent shift in US-Cuba relations reflect a longstanding popular narrative in which the United States sees itself as the patron or colonial parent of the underdeveloped Cuban state. And as with so many other countries less developed than ours, we imagine our government -- and now our technology companies -- acting as the savior to the people of the country, empowering the disempowered through the (sometimes) democratizing effects of our multi-billion dollar tech innovations. With the collective hysteria about false information in news media in the background, these headlines reflect a small but important problem that arises when we try to write our news for clicks. When we combine our hunger for web traffic with entrenched biases about the United States as a patron of what too many Americans still imagine to be a forlorn Communist island, we land on a path to increasingly misleading, poorly researched narratives about a place that is indeed knowable and deeply connected to the US, in culture, intellectual history, and much more. At a moment when human beings -- Cubans included -- are more connected to one another than ever before, editors can and should strive to do better by their readers.

With a dozen new companies announcing integrations with its platform, the search giant has dramatically increased what its smart speaker can do. Popular Searches Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▲ 55.96 +0.57 +1.03% Dave & Buster's Entertainment Inc PLAY ▲ 62.19 +1.42 +2.34% Annaly Capital Management Inc NLY ▲ 11.31 +0.08 +0.71% 800 Super Holdings Ltd 5TG = 1.20 0.00 0.00% Starting today, for most of these new additions, you'll be able to give a voice command to the Google Assistant built into the Google Home smart speaker and control devices from these 12 companies: August Lifx Wink Rachio TP-Link First Alert Vivint Best Buy Insignia Frigidaire Anova Geeni Logitech Harmony It's the first major update to Google's smart speaker since it launched last November. Back then, the Home worked with four platforms: Nest, Philips Hue, SmartThings and IFTTT. As a result, the Home was well behind its chief competitor -- the Amazon Echo -- when it came to controlling the smart home. Since then, Google's new partner announcements have included a few at CES in January, as well as Belkin WeMo lighting products and Honeywell connected thermostats a few weeks after that. This announcement doesn't quite even the playing field with Amazon, since Amazon's assistant Alexa now has more than 10,000 "skills" -- essentially third-party apps for voice control. Still, it's a big push in the right direction that includes many popular smart home products. It also expands Google Home's abilities into new territory. Previously, the Google Assistant only worked with lights, plugs, switches, thermostats and recently robot vacuums. Today's announcement includes locks, sprinklers, an air conditioner, a sous vide cooker and even a professionally installed smart home system. It comes hot on the heels of the news that the Home is coming to the UK and Europe in April. Google promised a push of this sort back in December of last year, when the company announced it'd be expanding Weave -- the language Google's devices use to speak to each other. Now, that promise is coming to fruition. What we know about these new integrations August This is the first lock to work with Google Home. You'll be able to ask the Google assistant to lock your door or check on the status of the lock. Unlike with Alexa, you won't be able to ask Google to unlock your door. August has promised that feature for Google later this year. With Alexa, unlocking the door requires you to say a PIN code. We'll see what extra security measures August puts into place for the Google Home when the time comes. For now, you can control both the first- and second-generation August locks with the Google Assistant as long as you also have the August Connect Wi-Fi Bridge. August now works with Alexa, Apple's HomeKit and Google Home. Lifx Just like with Philips Hue bulbs, you'll now be able to turn your Lifx bulbs on or off, adjust their brightness and change their color with a voice command to the Home. Unlike Philips Hue, Lifx bulbs don't require a hub to connect to the internet. Install your bulbs, link your account in the Google Home app and give your command. Lifx bulbs also work with Alexa, and will soon work with HomeKit. Wink All Wink-compatible lighting products and thermostats will now work with the Google Home. Wink's lighting products include bulbs, switches, dimmers and outlets. Wink joins SmartThings as the second major smart home platform to work with Google. Wink currently works with Alexa as well, but not HomeKit. Rachio Another new trick for the Google Home, you'll now be able to turn on your garden sprinklers with your voice. The Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller connects to your home's Wi-Fi and monitors the weather to help you water more efficiently. Rachio can control up to 16 zones of in-ground sprinklers, and now you'll be able to command Google to turn those sprinklers on or off or set a weather delay. Rachio works with Alexa as well. TP-Link Expanding Google's repertoire of bulbs and switches, you'll be able to control any of TP-Link's lighting products with your voice as well. With TP-Link's bulbs, you can change the color, dim the bulbs and turn the lights on and off with your voice. TP-Link even specified the colors you can pick with a voice command: yellow, red, blue, purple, orange, green and pink. Like the rest of these partners so far, TP-Link works with Alexa. Vivint Unlike the rest of the items on the list, you won't be able to take advantage of Vivint's new integration with the Google Home today -- it's due to launch in April. Vivint's also the only item on the list that is a professionally installed, whole-home smart system as opposed to individual do-it-yourself options. Thanks to Vivint's customized setups, Google Home will be able to control types of gadgets not yet available on the DIY front -- including cameras, security systems and garage doors. Pick your package of choice for professional installation, and you'll be able to do the basics with Google's smart speaker as well -- such as controlling lights, locks and thermostats. Vivint offers similar capabilities through packages that include an Amazon Echo. Best Buy Insignia Plug your fan or lamp into the Best Buy Insignia Wi-Fi Smart Plug, and you'll be able to turn it on or off with your voice. As with the rest of Google Home's compatible smart plugs, Insignia also has an Alexa skill.  Frigidaire Perhaps making use of Google's existing ability to control the temp via a thermostat, the Frigidaire Cool Connect will let the Google Home keep your place cool. Using your voice, you'll be able to control the temperature settings on Frigidaire's smart air conditioner. You'll also be able to set the fan speed and ask Google about the Cool Connect's current settings. Frigidaire does have a skill enabling similar controls with Amazon's assistant Alexa. Anova With the Anova Precision Cooker Bluetooth + Wi-Fi, you can make your sous vide cooking even more high tech with the Google Home. Just like with Anova's Alexa skill, you can use your voice to set the temperature, check the status of your cooker and even search for recipes. Anova expects its Google Home integration to be ready by early next week. Geeni Bringing even more smart lighting products to the table, you'll be able to control Geeni's smart switches and bulbs with Google Home, just like you can with Geeni's Alexa skill.  First Alert With the First Alert Wi-Fi Thermostat, Google now offers another option for controlling your temperature with your voice. Similar to First Alert's Alexa skill, you'll be able to set and check on the temperature with the Google Assistant.  Logitech Harmony You could already control your TV to an extent with Google Home and Google's Chromecast. Logitech Harmony brings lots of extra talents to Google's digital entertainment repertoire. By creating activities in the Logitech app, you'll be able to tell Google to turn on Netflix, or switch to a specific channel. You'll need to start each command with "OK, Google, ask Harmony to..." though I'd expect Google and Logitech to offer more flexible and intuitive commands soon. Logitech's compatible hubs -- the Harmony Hub, Harmony Companion and Harmony Elite -- also control a variety of third-party smart home devices, so you'll be able to dim the lights, turn on your speakers and launch the HBO app all with a customized command such as, "Hey, Google, ask Harmony to turn on movie time." Logitech has a similar set of skills you can enable with Amazon's Alexa. Finally gaining ground Since all of Google's new partnerships are already tied to Alexa, Google's obviously still playing catch up. Today, though, Google took a sizable chunk out of Alexa's lead. The Google Assistant built into the Home also responds to more flexible language than Amazon's Alexa. Because of that, and thanks to all of these new integrations, Google is already nipping at Amazon's heels in the smart home, despite the Echo's two-year head start.

Reuters/Fabrizio Bensch The last couple of years have seen the arrival in the market of smart clothes or apparel with technology embedded in them. With Project Jacquard, a venture of Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) in collaboration with Levi’s, commuters now have the upper hand to do simple tasks when enjoying a bike ride. Weaving touch controls into clothing fabrics was unheard of a decade ago, but Google’s ATAP set out to do just that.  A conductive thread called Jaquard Thread is combined with a small Bluetooth controller that runs on standard watch battery placed in a dedicated pocket. Building touch and gesture sensitive areas on the jacket sleeve, users are able to interact with a variety of services including making or dismissing a call, changing music and using map apps. All it takes is a tap or swipe of the sleeve. The Commuter Jacket was presented at the recent annual South by Southwest Festival (SXSW), held in Austin, Texas. The Commuter Trucker Jacket will reportedly go on sale this fall. Individuals interested in getting the futuristic piece of apparel will be back by US$350 (AUS$460), Android Authority reported. Such trends usher a new way of handling tech devices. Tractica, a market intelligence firm focused on human interaction with technology, had forecasted that total shipments of smart clothing will soar.  Shipments increased from 968,000 units in 2015 to 24.8 million units in 2021.  In an age when sensors and connected devices have emerged as more than fleeting trends, companies have lost no time creating innovations with specific customers in mind. Now available in the market are tech garments like the smart compression shirt suitable for athletes. It comes with heart rate capture points on the front and a pocket on the back for a GPS sensor, enabling wearers to track motion and heart rate metrics in real time, Wareable reported. At the CES event in Las Vegas last year, smart clothing vendors featured fashionable and functional innovations for the foot and chest. The Google innovation is essentially a wearable flexible touchscreen. The jacket is able to sense the human gesture, and a removable tag then sends a signal to the wearer’s phone. A simple swipe of a sleeve instantly gives the user directions. An incoming call may be dismissed with a swipe. A double tap with two fingers, on the other hand, will start or stop music. Bringing the innovation to the market was not a smooth ride.  Google had approached key decision-makers in the US fashion industry proposing the wearable tech.   Various brands and companies initially rejected the technology that sounded “foreign,” said Ivan Poupyrev, the technical program lead at Google ATAP. The tech company had to break down the skepticism. Years back, outerwear and snowboards manufacturer Burton Snowboards came out with a snowboarding jacket with a built-in MP3 player. It came with a fabric control panel keypad sewn into the sleeve and speakers built-into the helmet.  It signaled the state of things to come in wearable connected devices.

Sign up now Menu ARN Excel for Windows finally gets real-time collaboration Excel for Windows finally gets real-time collaboration Right now, it's in public beta for the company's most adventurous testers Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 29 March, 2017 05:21 - - - - print email Comments IDG Microsoft has brought live, collaborative editing to its Excel app for Windows through a beta update it launched on Tuesday. The new feature lets testers collaborate with one another on the same file from inside the app. Live collaboration has been a major focus of Office 2016, which Microsoft released roughly a year and a half ago. The suite first offered real-time co-authoring for the desktop version of Word, then expanded those capabilities to PowerPoint. It’s a major change for Microsoft’s client applications, which previously kept editing to a fairly solitary experience. It’s worth noting that just starting a file in Excel doesn’t automatically bestow real-time co-authoring capabilities on it. Using Office’s real-time collaboration also requires keeping files in one of Microsoft’s online file storage systems. Microsoft’s support for real-time collaboration is key to keeping up with Google’s G Suite offering. Google Sheets has offered real-time collaboration for years and the Mountain View-based tech giant has been pushing hard to attract enterprise customers who would ordinarily use Microsoft Office. When using the co-authoring features, users’ profile pictures will appear at the top of the ribbon in the Excel window. Clicking on a profile picture will let users jump to where another person is working on the spreadsheet, so it’s possible to keep tabs on what is changing. Microsoft also introduced a new AutoSave feature in beta for Word, Excel and PowerPoint on Windows, which is designed to automatically save files stored in the company's cloud storage services as users are editing them. It's supposed to cut down on that sinking feeling that comes from realizing that an Office app has crashed with unsaved data inside it. Google, Apple and other players in the productivity industry have already supported similar functionality using their cloud services. Right now, the Excel for Windows desktop app’s real-time collaboration capabilities are only available to people who are a part of the Office Insider Program’s Fast ring, though Microsoft expects to roll the feature out to more users soon. It’s possible to work with people who don’t have a beta version of the desktop app using Excel Online, along with Excel for Android, Windows Phone and iOS (though that last one is also in beta).

Google Home 'smart' assistant with interchangeable bases - definitely not a cheap air freshener Chris Merriman @ChrisTheDJ 28 March 2017 Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   0 Comments Google is planning to release a duo of home automation and Wi-Fi products in the UK next week as it bids to catch-up with the lead established by Amazon and others.  Google Home is the company's home personal assistant rival to Amazon Echo. It will go on sale on 6 April offering integration with the Google ecosystem via Google Assistant, currently rolling out to newer Android devices. Google WiFi, which launches on the same day, is the company's whole-home Wi-Fi router, offering mesh connection between units for better coverage. Google has confirmed localised partnerships with providers, including the BBC, Sky News, the Financial Times, The Sun and The Guardian. It also offers smart home integration with its own Nest thermostat product, SmartThings and Philips Hue, with many more offered via IFTTT. It has also been confirmed that UK-based smart home company Energenie and German thermostat maker Tado are among companies that will be offering integration with IFTTT ahead of full integration soon. Google Home also offers a briefing that combines weather, calendar and news, as well as drawing on other Google services to create a home system capable of controlling Chromecast playback and connected speakers. Google Wi-Fi will use meshing to improve the signal of each unit placed around the home, as well as defaulting to Google DNS servers for low latency, and the whole thing is controlled by an app. It can turn off individual units at different times, so you could, theoretically, limit your childrens' access at bedtime. However, the bad news all this comes with a significant mark-upcompared to the US. Google WiFi is £129 for one unit, and £229 for two. Compare that with $299 (£237) for three in the US. Google Home units are £129, slightly cheaper than a full-price Amazon Echo, but significantly more than the Echo Dot, for which there is nothing similar. Coloured interchangeable bases to match your interior decoration scheme decor comes in at £18 for fabric or £36 for metal.  Google has also confirmed that as well as proper UK English recognition and a UK voice, the Assistant will also have a few UK Easter eggs to find as well. Products will be available from all good department and electrical stores, such as John Lewis, as well as Argos, Dixons, Maplin, EE Stores, and the Google Store.  Further reading Intel takes different tack on PC performance with launch of Optane 2280 storage cache Hardware 28 Mar 2017 Google and Microsoft bump-up bug bounty bunce Operating Systems 06 Mar 2017 Google Go, TypeScript, Swift, F# and Rust are the most wanted newer languages, according to Stack Overflow survey Developer 22 Mar 2017 Facebook, Google, Twitter urged to change terms for European users or face fines Cloud and Infrastructure 17 Mar 2017 AMD microprocessor prices slashed following the launch of Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 Hardware 27 Mar 2017 Google's Project Zero outs 'severe' vulnerability in Microsoft's Edge browser Security 01 Mar 2017 Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   Topics Hardware Google Cloud Computing IoT More news Amber Rudd accused of adopting Sir Humphrey Appleby-style obfuscation in Snoopers' Charter codes consultation Government trying to intimidate people into silence by adopting bureaucratic legalese in Investigatory Powers Act codes of conduct consultation Communications 28 March 2017 Ministry of Defence on the hunt for data scientists with expertise in AI Four data scientists ought to be enough to keep the UK safe, believes the MoD Government 28 March 2017 Elon Musk starts Neuralink to develop an interface between computers and the human brain Reports suggest that the entrepreneur has started yet another new venture Big Data and Analytics 28 March 2017 Giffgaff's data-based collaborative culture should make GDPR compliance easier, says head of BI 'We want to listen, we want to collaborate, and we want to create mutual benefits using data', says Helen Mannion Telecoms 28 March 2017 Add a comment Add a comment Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Back to Top Most read Two thirds of UK enterprise now using the public cloud Google Home and Google Wi-Fi coming to the UK on 6 April at £129 each Elon Musk starts Neuralink to develop an interface between computers and the human brain Intel takes different tack on PC performance with launch of Optane 2280 storage cache Home secretary Amber Rudd renews government attacks on internet encryption Contact Marketing solutions Enterprise IT Events About Incisive Media Terms & conditions Privacy policy RSS Twitter LinkedIn Newsletters Apps © Incisive Business Media © Incisive Business Media (IP) Limited, Published by Incisive Business Media Limited, Haymarket House, 28-29 Haymarket, London SW1Y 4RX, are companies registered in England and Wales with company registration numbers 9177174 & 9178013 Digital publisher of the year 2010, 2013 & 2016 Digital publisher of the year 2010, 2013 & 2016

The Mountain View giant is slowly rolling out the update, so some users could expect it to arrive later this week.  On Tuesday, Google Search on iOS product manager Nabil Shahid announced via the Google blog that the iOS version of the Google app is being updated with the integration of the Gboard keyboard. The keyboard for iPhone was launched last May as a standalone app. With the update, this keyboard is now part of the Google Search app as a feature that allows users to search and send information, GIFs, emojis and more straight from the keyboard.  Once the Google app has been updated, users can activate the Gboard keyboard feature by heading to the Google app Settings and setting it up for the device. The new functionality can be accessed on the keyboard by tapping Google’s “G” logo that’s displayed on the left side of the word suggestions field atop the keys.  The new update also brings a new widget called Trending on Google. According to Shahid, this widget will help users be in the know about the latest stories and breaking news from all around the world. The widget displays live trending searches on Google, so if users see something that catches their eyes a single tap would launch the Google app where they could read the story or news that caught their attention.  Users can access the Trending on Google widget by activating 3D Touch on the app icon or by simply swiping right on the home screen. On the home screen, users should tap Edit then proceed to adding the Trending on Google widget.  Google has also added a set of quick search actions to the Google app. These options can be accessed by hard pressing the app icon. Shahid pointed out that 3D Touch has been integrated throughout the app, so hard pressing on certain features of the app would lead to more options. For example, hard pressing on Search results will let users preview content before opening it.  Google for iOS has a new update, and it comes with a new widget.

Now it looks like Google is deepening their grip on iOS users because in an update to its iOS app, Google is integrating Gboard into the Google app. According to Google, “While Gboard first launched as a standalone app, it now comes installed with the Google app. Don’t be stifled by the same old texts and smiley faces; with Gboard, expressing yourself with emoji, multiple languages and GIFs has never been easier or more fun.” Gboard in Google’s app acts pretty much the same way as you might expect from the regular Gboard app. This means that if you’ve used the app before then you should be pretty familiar with how it works and some of its features. For those who haven’t, we guess this could be a good introduction to the app which might encourage you to use it as your default keyboard. Users will be able to perform searches within the keyboard itself, pull up GIFs, emojis, and more. In addition, Google has introduced a “Trending on Google” widget so that you can always stay up to date with what’s hot at the moment. The update should be live so head on over to the iTunes App Store if you’d like to get your hands on it. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about Apps, Gboard, Google and iOS.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (Photo: Seth Wenig / AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE New York — Uber’s first report on employee diversity shows low numbers for women, especially in technical positions. In that regard, the company is similar to other Silicon Valley giants such as Google, Facebook and Apple. But Uber’s report comes as pressure mounts on the company in light of sexual harassment claims by a former employee, the antics of its embattled CEO Travis Kalanick and ongoing criticisms of a boorish “brogrammer” culture. Management defections include that of the company’s president, Jeff Jones, after just six months on the job. Thirty-six percent of the company’s worldwide employees are women, according to the report, which does not count drivers as employees. Google, in comparison, has 31 percent women and Apple, 32 percent. When it comes to technology jobs such as engineering, only 15 percent are women at Uber. At Google, it’s 19 percent and Apple, 23 percent. As with other tech companies , Uber is making some progress in diversifying its work force. The new hires at the company show a higher percentage of women — 41 percent — as well as more underrepresented minorities. In the U.S., the largest ethnic group at Uber is white and the second largest is Asian. The report also shows that nearly 9 percent of the company’s U.S. employees are black and almost 6 percent are Hispanic. At Google, a much larger company, the numbers are 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Uber also says 15 percent of its U.S. employees hold work visas, and they hail from 71 countries. Other technology companies have not been disclosing this information, but it’s possible that they will follow Uber’s steps — especially as the industry continues to clash heads with President Donald Trump’s administration over immigration issues. Uber has about 12,000 employees worldwide, about half in the U.S. The San Francisco company has hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to lead an investigation into the sexual harassment charges leveled by the former engineer, Susan Fowler. The company plans to release the findings next month. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images Both chambers of the U.S. Congress have voted to overturn the Federal Communications Commission's privacy rules for Internet service providers. Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images President Trump is expected to sign into law a decision by Congress to overturn new privacy rules for Internet service providers. Passed by the Federal Communications Commission in October, the rules never went into effect. If they had, it would have given consumers more control over how ISPs use the data they collect. Most notably, the rules would have required explicit consent from consumers if sensitive data — like financial or health information, or browsing history — were to be shared or sold. Politics Congress Overturns Internet Privacy Regulation These rules wouldn't have applied to the likes of Google or Facebook — massive data collectors and digital advertisers — and that's been a major point of contention for ISPs. But consumer groups argue that's no reason to roll back restrictions on Internet providers. Plus, they point out, you could abandon those companies in favor of other websites, if you disagree with their policies; switching Internet providers is not so easy. ISPs have long attempted to break into the ad-targeting and online marketing world, where the competition is intense. For context on what that market looks like, I turned to Jules Polonetsky, privacy expert and CEO of the Future of Privacy Forum, a nonprofit organization promoting responsible data collection. Below are excerpts of the interview, edited for clarify and length. Interview Highlights On what's going on and what changes All Tech Considered Online Trackers Follow Our Digital Shadow By 'Fingerprinting' Browsers, Devices For the average consumer, just about every site they visit online is sharing data with other ad networks, with other third parties, for the purpose of either measuring or targeting ads. ... Even most privacy organizations end up using Google Analytics or some other basic tools. ... For better or worse, the predominant business model online has become ad-supported. ... So for the average user, the experience isn't likely to change one way or another — today they see ads targeted based on their activity; tomorrow they'll see ads based on their activity. Now, what choices people have maybe has gotten a little bit more complicated. ... ISPs have historically played a very small role in (the ad targeting) market for a range of reasons. The most interesting and valuable data is search, social media data — and that is typically only available to the big portals that have that data. The ISPs don't have it if it's encrypted. ... The big challenge for big advertisers is that their audience is dispersed across laptop, and mobile, and tablet, and TV and elsewhere. And linking that user's identity is a challenge. ... And this is a place where ISPs are able to play a role. ... They now have something to offer — cross-device capabilities — that others can do, but others have to do it differently. ... On existing opt-out options The ad networks of the world offer an opt-out of ad targeting today. If there's a triangle 'i' on your banner ad, that means that that company is tailoring ads based on your Web surfing and is offering you an opt-out. All Tech Considered How Free Web Content Traps People In An Abyss Of Ads And Clickbait Mobile devices offer a bunch of options to allow or not allow information about apps to be used. My iPhone lets me clear my ad ID if I don't want apps to be able to track me or work with their ad network partners to track me. ... Apps don't support cookies, but the ad ID supplied by the operating system — Apple now lets you wipe that out, Google lets you reset it. So that's a pretty effective opt-out system for apps at least. Use of location, similarly. On ISPs' argument that Google, Facebook, et al. are collecting more data and yet have less stringent regulation For better or worse, online data has been democratized and there are third-party ad exchanges where anybody can show up and have access to a big swath of your Web surfing. All Tech Considered Firms Are Buying, Sharing Your Online Info. What Can You Do About It? The BlueKai Bluebook, which is provided to potential advertisers, has 80 sources of data where Oracle's BlueKai data exchange has linked together data from Web surfing, from offline purchases, from all sorts of providers who have pulled data about you that they have online. ... So I've kind of looked at some of this debate with a bit of bemusement because I see the activity in these third-party data markets and that horse is out of that barn. I think for consumers who a more privacy-protective experience, there are a number of options, none of them are perfect — other than, perhaps using a VPN, which may not be easy for everyone to use. ... The good news that an increasing amount of the activity online is encrypted, due to lots of advocacy. ... Increasingly, much of what you do is shielded from third parties because of encryption in place. The ISPs typically — in their efforts to use this data even before this (FCC) rule — have been providing consumers with ISP-level opt-outs. ... People should look for emails — typically they do push out an announcement when they roll out an ad-targeting program. On the regulatory oversight of privacy The FTC has generally been the lead privacy enforcer, and I think has been very aggressive at doing so. If you look at the recent Vizio case, they were able to take very strong action against sharing of your viewing history. ... At the end of the day, the willingness of the FCC and the FTC to use their authority effectively is what will determine whether the consumers are protected. The FCC (has in the past) used even its high-level authority very aggressively, and the FTC certainly historically has. We obviously don't know exactly how the new chairs will. ... On how ISPs' data collection compares to that of Google, Facebook and others The ad networks of the world typically share, swap and trade data via various exchanges. Google and Facebook have policies that to some degree use your data for ad targeting, but may limit the further use of it. For instance, Facebook does not want your Facebook data being shared — they'd like advertisers to come to Facebook to (place) ads on Facebook. All Tech Considered Online Health Searches Aren't Always Confidential That may be a nuance because ... to a consumer, data being used to tailor their experience is probably what makes a difference — whether it's being sold or used in a way that tracks and targets them. So the implementations that we see in the market of ISPs have focused on allowing the ISP to help ad network partners to do a better job of recognizing users. ... I think at the end of the day, for consumers, it ends up being parsing hairs. So the question is ... do the sites I visit get information that allows ads to be targeted based on other information about me? And that information isn't just Web browsing — a big part of ad-targeting today involves pinging on offline data, my actual purchases at a supermarket, my actual transactions. ... So what the advertisers are often looking to do is to work with partners who are able to put them and their offers in front the users they want to reach. Sometimes, that's "here's the Web browsing history," which they can get from an exchange, or they can get by going on one of the big portals, or presumably they'll be able to get by going to ISPs. The market doesn't think about it in terms of selling data — the market thinks about it in terms of "how does an advertiser find the audience that it thinks it wants." ... And different providers in the market will create those audiences. On what users can do to restrict or entirely limit their data from being collected It pays to opt out of the behavioral advertising, when you see that triangle 'i' because thousands of companies will at least not target you — they may still be collecting data, but they're not gonna be tailoring the ads that you see. All Tech Considered Cryptoparties Teach Attendees How To Stay Anonymous Online I think turning on Do-Not-Track on your browser, despite the fact that only a small number of companies respect it — a significant number of companies like Twitter, Medium and others do respect it. ... Choosing encrypted tools when you use email or make decisions about what sites and services (to use) — far less information about what you do during the day is going to be available. For the changes that have been made today, those tools are going to be effective, because the uses that the ISPs are likely to be interested are, frankly, these tailoring and targeting uses — and so (these tools) for most people are going to be reasonable. They're not going to promise you absolute privacy, but neither would have the FCC rule. ... If you're really looking to disengage from the commercial world, it's hard to take advantage of much of the Web without being fairly technically savvy. ... If today's vote allows ISPs broader latitude with how they can use data, primarily for advertising and marketing uses, most of these tools will turn off those functions. And consumers should look for the options that the ISPs should offer in addition.

BrianFagioli writes: Google is an essential member of the open source community. The search giant contributes some really great projects, offering code to be used many -- it claims more than 2,000 such contributions! Heck, the company even hosts the annual Summer of Code program, where it pairs students with open source projects teams. In other words, Google is helping to get young folks excited about open source. Today, Google announced that it is launching an all-new website to focus on open source. It is not a general open source site, but a destination to learn more about the search-giant's relationship with it. "Today, we're launching opensource.google.com, a new website for Google Open Source that ties together all of our initiatives with information on how we use, release, and support open source. This new site showcases the breadth and depth of our love for open source. It will contain the expected things: our programs, organizations we support, and a comprehensive list of open source projects we've released. But it also contains something unexpected: a look under the hood at how we 'do' open source," says Will Norris, Open Source Programs Office, Google. google internet networking ← You may like to read: → DJI Proposes New Electronic 'License Plate' For Drones Donald Trump Wins US Presidency Garmin Engineer Shot And Killed By Man Yelling 'Get Out Of My Country!'

The update is slowly rolling out, however, so some users could be receiving it in the coming days.  On Tuesday, Google started rolling out the new version of its Google Maps app for Android devices. Aside from the usual under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes, the update comes with a more streamlined method of sharing location details. Apparently, the contact-sharing feature has been expanded to include a new tool that allows users to share their location with their contacts using links.  The Sharing via link feature also has the same controls as contact sharing. Once activated, users will see a notification at the bottom of the Google Maps home screen that says, “People with this link can see your location.” In creating location links, users are asked to set the time for when their selected contacts could view their location details. Once done assigning the time limit for the link, users are then asked to pick the app where they’ll be sharing their location info. From the looks of it, users can share the location link via Hangouts, Slack and many other apps. They can even email the link or send it as a text message via the Messages app. Interestingly, the links could also be shared on Twitter, which is good if users want to inform their followers of their whereabouts.  According to Android Police, the Google Maps links can be managed like connections to contacts. Hence, users are at liberty to deactivate them at any time they wish to and keep track of their current status in the app. Each URL link is made to be different just like the ones found in the photo-sharing feature of Google Photos.  Android users who want to try out or use the new Sharing via link feature should first check if the new update for the Google Maps app is already available in their region. Google is slowly but surely rolling out this update, so don’t fret when it’s still not showing up on the Google Play Store.  Google Maps has a new update.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Wednesday March 29, 2017 News Business Larger / SmallerNight Mode Australia now officially has 'Google tax', aims to collect $2b Nassim Khadem 29 Mar 2017, 11:06 a.m. The law aims to recoup revenue from some of the nation's biggest companies including Apple, BHP Billiton, Chevron and Crown. Australia now officially has 'Google tax', aims to collect $2b Treasurer Scott Morrison arrives in the press gallery for an interview, at Parliament House in Canberra on Monday 27 March 2017. fedpol Photo: Alex Ellinghausen Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit The Turnbull government's "Google tax" has been passed into law, arming the Australian Taxation Office with some of the world's strongest powers to fight multinationals as it moves to recoup $2 billion in revenue from some of the nation's biggest companies including Apple, BHP Billiton, Chevron and Crown. But as more countries hunt for a greater share of revenue from multinationals, concerns remain that disagreements between global agencies about which nation is entitled to tax profits could spark revenue wars. Nevertheless, in a local context the Diverted Profits Tax (DPT), informally dubbed Australia's "Google tax", has already had a big impact on the behaviour of multinationals. A number of companies including tech giant Google restructured their tax affairs in anticipation of the laws passing and others have been negotiating with Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan. The federal government said the DPT, to commence on July 1 2017, would raise about $100 million in revenue a year from 2018-19. Australia has a range of other laws aimed at multinationals and the ATO already has audits of big companies under way, which could see up to $2 billion in revenue flowing in, depending on whether or not those companies fight their tax bills. Big profits targeted The DPT laws are aimed at multinationals with global revenue of more than $1 billion and Australian revenue of greater than $25 million. They will be hit with a 40 per cent tax on all profits - that is 10 per cent higher than the 30 per cent company tax rate. It aims to ensure that the tax paid by global entities properly reflects the economic substance of their activities in Australia and prevents the diversion of profits offshore through contrived arrangements. The tax does not apply to managed investment trusts or similar foreign entities, sovereign wealth funds and foreign pension funds. It will, however, encourage significant global entities to provide greater information to the ATO to allow for the timely resolution of tax disputes. Treasurer Scott Morrison announced the legislation in the 2016-17 budget in response to public outcry over companies shifting billions of dollars in profits each year to lower-tax nations. Mr Morrison told Parliament the laws will "encourage greater cooperation between unco-operative multinationals and the ATO". Timelier resolution? "As a result this will greatly reduce the length of disputes between the ATO and multinationals, and lead to timelier dispute resolution," he said. Australia followed the lead of Britain, which has a similar laws aimed at multinationals which resulted in Google agreeing to a deal with that country's tax authorities to pay ??130 million ($214 million) in back taxes. "It provides a powerful new tool for the Australian Taxation Office to tackle contrived arrangements and unco-operative taxpayers, and will reinforce Australia's position as having some of the toughest laws in the world to combat multinational tax avoidance," Mr Morrison said. But shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said the government was "waging a phoney war on multinationals". "The fact is that the government estimates their Diverted Profits Tax will raise just one-eighth of the revenue that Labor would raise through closing debt-deduction loopholes," he said. "Since coming to office, the Turnbull government has cut over 3000 staff from the tax office. With fewer staff, it's harder for the tax office to enforce their laws." The staff cuts have happened in the midst of several laws being passed. The Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL), introduced in January this year, which also targets multinational profit shifting by boosting the ATO's anti-avoidance powers. The ATO also has at its disposal tough transfer pricing rules. The government in last year's budget also announced a 1300-member ATO tax avoidance taskforce that would be dedicated to stopping rorting by multinationals, private companies and wealthy individuals. That measure is expected to raise $3.7 billion up to 2020. Audits underway In a speech at The Tax Institute's conference in Adelaide earlier this month, Mr Jordan said the federal government's tax avoidance taskforce was aimed at catching companies "who are not doing the right thing". There were already 71 audits under way in the large business area covering 59 multinational corporations, Mr Jordan said. At least seven major multinational audits were expected to come to a head before June 30, Mr Jordan said, four in e-commerce and three in the energy and resource industries. The ATO expects liabilities to total more than $2 billion from these seven companies. Oxfam Australia spokeswoman Joy Kyriacou welcomed the passing of the DPT laws, but said more needed to be done to stop about $6 billion of offshoring of profits by Australian-based multinationals. She said the government needs to ensure country-by-country reporting of tax affairs for all big businesses happens and is made public. "Australian Tax Office data shows more than one in three big companies are paying no tax," she said. "Big companies operating from Australia should be required to be transparent and publicly report on their profits, taxes and assets for every country in which they operate, so it's harder for them to shift profits and dodge paying their fair share."

More than a dozen Republicans  voted against it. The vote on the Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval Tuesday (March 28) came after heated and sometimes loud debate, over the issue and even extended to talk about underwear size after Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) said that ISPs should not be able to sell online information on what size of underwear he buys to garment companies. The Senate approved the CRA resolution March 23 by a vote of 50 to 48. The resolution removes the rules, approved on a party line vote Oct. 27, from the congressional record and prevents the FCC from adopting substantially similar rules in the future. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said the bill would allow "Big Brother" to get bigger. Comcast's name was invoked repeatedly as something of a poster-company for those big ISPs seeking to run roughshod over consumer privacy rights, as Democrats portrayed the issue. Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) noted that not a lot of Republicans were coming to the floor to defend the resolution. For his part, he said broadband providers were trying to seize the value of the Internet from content providers. He said everyone wanted a reasonable capital return on infrastructure, but said the entire value chain of the Internet should not be turned over to that infrastructure side. RELATED: House Privacy Vote Draws Industry Reaction In response to Republican arguments that content provider data collector--Amazon, Google--were bigger than ISPs, Polis said content providers should be, given the value of that content. But he also said consumers could choose not to use Google or Facebook, but had little competition for Internet access.  Polis said the Republicans were trying to shift the burden for cybersecurity from ISPs to consumers and collect more data to do whatever they want with it. He called it an "irrevocable step in the wrong direction." Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Tex.), who was managing the rules for voting on the CRA, called it a duplicative regulation "dropped on the doorstep" by the previous Administration. In his opening statement, which was the bulk of the Republican floor argument for the bill, he said that the FCC's new and expanded privacy rules were adopted a mere 10 days before the election, on a party-line vote. He called them a departure from the Federal Trade Commission's [privacy by design] approach. He called the FCC's approach unfairly skews the market in favor of providers, in this case edge providers, like search engines, social media sites and content providers like Netflix, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, who are under the FTC's opt-out approach to web browsing and app use, rather than the FCC rules' opt-in requirement for ISP use of similar info. RELATED: Sen. Al Franken, Other Legislators Weigh In on Privacy Rule Rollback He said the FCC rules are arbitrary government intervention in the free market that can inhibit security and market competition and their cybersecurity notification requirements could lead to "notice fatigue" while creating confusion by "subjecting part of the Internet ecosystem to different rules and jurisdictions." Burgess said the CRA would simply restore the status quo before the 2015 open Internet order and bring the marketplace back into balance. During debate on the actual bill, Republicans lined up to blast the rules, including Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), chair of the House communications Subcommittee, Greg Walden (R-Ore.), chair of the House Energy & Commerce Committee. They said the regs would stifle innovation and hurt consumers. Blackburn backed a House version of the CRA that passed in the Senate before moving on to the House. They said the Federal Trade Commission should be overseeing broadband privacy.  Bill Johnson (R-Ohio) said the FCC decision ignored the wishes of consumers in favor of a regulatory power grab. Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) said Congress had "betrayed the American people" on privacy. She said broadband providers will be able to sell personal information to the highest bidder and no one, including the FTC, would be able to protect them. "If it's gone today, it's gone, period." Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) said that ISPs should have to ask for permission to use subs' info not matter what kind of information it is, sensitive or nonsensitive. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-Calif.), ranking member of the Energy & Commerce Committee said consumers were rightfully concerned about the sale of their information given that Republicans were trying wipe out privacy protections. He called the CRA a gift to countries like Russia, who wanted to access our citizens' information. "Consumers want more privacy protections, not less." RELATED: FCC Chairman Pai Signals Title II Rollback Is Best Privacy Protection Rep. Bob Latta (R-Ohio) said he has introduced legislation that would close a legal gap and make sure that the FTC can regulate broadband privacy if it gets that authority back from the FTC. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FTC's exemption from regulating common carriers could also apply to non-common carrier subsidiaries, say if Verizon bought Yahoo!. That could leave a privacy regulatory gap, and Latta's bill would make it clear that the exemption applied to the parent telecom, not noncommon carrier subsidiaries, essentially confirming that the exemption applies only to common carrier activities. The bill was voted on a closed rule, which meant no amendments, though Democrats opposed that rule and tried to add an amendment that would have made President Trump, and future Presidents and presidential candidates, release their tax returns. House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) said Tuesday that rolling back the FCC's privacy regs would be the 15th CRA resolution that has passed the House in an effort to "bring back common sense regulation." ISPS pledged last year, and reiterated in a conference call with reporters before the vote, that they would abide by voluntary privacy principles, and that in any event there was still plenty of federal and state privacy oversight without the rules. Broadband privacy oversight will also automatically revert back to the FTC if and when either Congress or the FCC reclassifies ISPs as information service providers, rather than telecoms subject to Title II common carrier regs.

We have already listed out the main features and enhancements that come along with the preview build. However, Google today released an exclusive video explaining the features in the Android O for developers. In the video, the main features of the developer preview are highlighted such as improved performance, notifications, and privacy, and more. Android Developers published the video. To improve the battery performance, Google has introduced stringent rules for background play of the apps. In Android O, background services of the apps will only run for a limited time after crossing the limit; the app won’t be visible in the background. Related Google Duo Gets Voice Call Support While Google Translate Gets ‘Definitions’ Section Besides, even the apps that are not created for Android O will get a performance uplift along with new privacy changes. For example, in Android O when the device gets into cache mode, the system releases wake locks. Location updates on Android O will be done in a limited manner every hour. Privacy control has been enhanced, which gives more power to the user including the authority to decide what accounts will be visible to other apps. Advertisement ‘What’s New’ Video By Google Android O also supports Multi-Display, which means that users won’t have to mirror their device anymore to display its screen on another screen. Android O has inbuilt support for secondary display along with separate display settings. Multi-Display means that there you can choose what to display on your phone and what to display on the secondary. For example – your phone can have footnotes and index for your project while the secondary display can run the creative presentation. Google has also worked on the notifications functionality and layout. Developers who want to bring their apps on Android O will have to integrate Channels. In the absence of Channels, notifications from apps will not appear on the screen. As we said, Google has extended more power to the users this time in every category; users now have the authority to block, change importance, vibration, lights, and lock screen privacy on their Android device with Android O. Related Google Play Store Takes Inspiration From App Store, Adds ‘Free App of the Week’ Section On the whole, Android O looks interesting and user friendly.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google trying out new look for Google Play Store search results By Ida Torres - March 28, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google likes to sometimes play around with what the Google Play Store UI looks like, and depending on the response of users, they sometimes keep it or discard it or try out something else. This time around the new look involves bigger looking cards in the search results when it comes to what they determine is the app you’re actually looking for. Of course there are still other search results in case you’re looking for something else, but they’re part of a side scrolling list. The old UI gives you equally sized card lists whenever you type in a search term in the Play Store. Now you get the most likely search results in a large card, which shows information like average star rating, the number of ratings, approximate number of downloads, content rating, and if it has a Top Developer status. You also get video preview (if any) and the screenshots to give you a better idea of what the app looks like. You will see the other suggested apps in either “You Might Also Like” or “Similar Apps” and in a smaller card that is side scrolling. The new UI will only show up if you type out the full name of the app but not click on the prompted app page. But if you do know the app name already, you will probably click on the prompted app, so it’s really not that useful. And if you don’t know the exact app but want to look for the best app in a certain category, this new UI will not appear since it will only show up when you type the exact, correct name of an app. So the long and the short of it is that the new UI for search results may actually be pointless since you most likely use the search button when you’re not exactly sure what app you’re looking for. Let’s see if this “experiment” lasts or if it will change the way we search for apps on Google Play Store.

As some of the world’s largest advertisers pull spending from Google’s YouTube video-sharing site amid concerns about placement with potentially offensive material, Twitter is touting that its Periscope ads will be placed predictably and only with high-quality publishers that the marketers choose. “They’ll be able to scale and have complete control about where their message appears on live content on Twitter,’’ Matt Derella, Twitter’s vice president of global revenue, said in an interview. “Brands can control and choose the trusted content they want to align their message with.’’ It’s a difficult promise to make about live content. Periscope users have posted live feeds of violent protests and crimes, for example. The social-media company has a program to work directly with certain publishers, such as media organizations and influencers. When advertising starts on Periscope in the coming weeks, initially on a trial basis, Twitter will share the revenue with those top-tier creators. The ads will play before the videos start rolling. Twitter is struggling to win market share in a digital-ad market dominated by Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. It may have an opportunity in video as YouTube works to repair relationships with advertisers that saw their commercials play alongside offensive, racist or extremist content. YouTube had been matching ads to videos automatically, as opposed to letting marketers pick the pairings – a tactic that allowed the site’s ad business to grow quickly but now has the company scrambling for technical solutions. Periscope’s progress will be slower, with an invitation-only trial to start, Derella said. Twitter wouldn’t say how much of the video on its site comes from its Periscope tool – only that many millions of hours of Periscope are watched every month. The company is betting on video advertising to help boost its sales, which have slowed in recent quarters and are expected to post their first annual decline this year.

UberþÄôs first report on employee diversity shows low numbers for women, especially in technology positions. UberþÄôs report doesnþÄôt count drivers as employees. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) NEW YORK – Uber’s first report on employee diversity shows low numbers for women, especially in technical positions. In that regard, the company is similar to other Silicon Valley giants such as Google, Facebook and Apple. But Uber’s report comes as pressure mounts on the company in light of sexual harassment claims by a former employee, the antics of its embattled CEO Travis Kalanick and ongoing criticisms of a boorish “brogrammer” culture. Management defections include that of the company’s president, Jeff Jones, after just six months on the job. Thirty-six percent of the company’s employees are women, according to the report , which does not count drivers as employees. Google, in comparison, has 31 percent women and Apple, 32 percent. When it comes to technology jobs such as engineering, only 15 percent are women at Uber. At Google, it’s 19 percent and Apple, 23 percent. As with other tech companies, the largest ethnic group at Uber in the U.S. is white and the second largest is Asian. The report also shows that nearly 9 percent of the company’s U.S. employees are black and almost 6 percent are Hispanic. At Google, a much larger company, the numbers are 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Also like other tech companies , Uber is making some progress in diversifying its work force. The new hires at the company show a higher percentage of women – 41 percent – as well as more underrepresented minorities. Uber also says 15 percent of its employees hold work visas, and they hail from 71 countries. Other technology companies have not been disclosing this information, but it’s possible that they will follow Uber’s steps – especially as the industry continues to clash heads with President Donald Trump’s administration over immigration issues. The San Francisco company has hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to lead an investigation into the sexual harassment charges leveled by the former engineer, Susan Fowler. The company plans to release the findings next month.

Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images Both chambers of the U.S. Congress have voted to overturn the Federal Communications Commission's privacy rules for Internet service providers. Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images President Trump is expected to sign into law a decision by Congress to overturn new privacy rules for Internet service providers. Passed by the Federal Communications Commission in October, the rules never went into effect. If they had, it would have given consumers more control over how ISPs use the data they collect. Most notably, the rules would have required explicit consent from consumers if sensitive data — like financial or health information, or browsing history — were to be shared or sold. Politics Congress Overturns Internet Privacy Regulation These rules wouldn't have applied to the likes of Google or Facebook — massive data collectors and digital advertisers — and that's been a major point of contention for ISPs. But consumer groups argue that's no reason to roll back restrictions on Internet providers. Plus, they point out, you could abandon those companies in favor of other websites, if you disagree with their policies; switching Internet providers is not so easy. ISPs have long attempted to break into the ad-targeting and online marketing world, where the competition is intense. For context on what that market looks like, I turned to Jules Polonetsky, privacy expert and CEO of the Future of Privacy Forum, a nonprofit organization promoting responsible data collection. Below are excerpts of the interview, edited for clarify and length. Interview Highlights On what's going on and what changes All Tech Considered Online Trackers Follow Our Digital Shadow By 'Fingerprinting' Browsers, Devices For the average consumer, just about every site they visit online is sharing data with other ad networks, with other third parties, for the purpose of either measuring or targeting ads. ... Even most privacy organizations end up using Google Analytics or some other basic tools. ... For better or worse, the predominant business model online has become ad-supported. ... So for the average user, the experience isn't likely to change one way or another — today they see ads targeted based on their activity; tomorrow they'll see ads based on their activity. Now, what choices people have maybe has gotten a little bit more complicated. ... ISPs have historically played a very small role in (the ad targeting) market for a range of reasons. The most interesting and valuable data is search, social media data — and that is typically only available to the big portals that have that data. The ISPs don't have it if it's encrypted. ... The big challenge for big advertisers is that their audience is dispersed across laptop, and mobile, and tablet, and TV and elsewhere. And linking that user's identity is a challenge. ... And this is a place where ISPs are able to play a role. ... They now have something to offer — cross-device capabilities — that others can do, but others have to do it differently. ... On existing opt-out options The ad networks of the world offer an opt-out of ad targeting today. If there's a triangle 'i' on your banner ad, that means that that company is tailoring ads based on your Web surfing and is offering you an opt-out. All Tech Considered How Free Web Content Traps People In An Abyss Of Ads And Clickbait Mobile devices offer a bunch of options to allow or not allow information about apps to be used. My iPhone lets me clear my ad ID if I don't want apps to be able to track me or work with their ad network partners to track me. ... Apps don't support cookies, but the ad ID supplied by the operating system — Apple now lets you wipe that out, Google lets you reset it. So that's a pretty effective opt-out system for apps at least. Use of location, similarly. On ISPs' argument that Google, Facebook, et al. are collecting more data and yet have less stringent regulation For better or worse, online data has been democratized and there are third-party ad exchanges where anybody can show up and have access to a big swath of your Web surfing. All Tech Considered Firms Are Buying, Sharing Your Online Info. What Can You Do About It? The BlueKai Bluebook, which is provided to potential advertisers, has 80 sources of data where Oracle's BlueKai data exchange has linked together data from Web surfing, from offline purchases, from all sorts of providers who have pulled data about you that they have online. ... So I've kind of looked at some of this debate with a bit of bemusement because I see the activity in these third-party data markets and that horse is out of that barn. I think for consumers who a more privacy-protective experience, there are a number of options, none of them are perfect — other than, perhaps using a VPN, which may not be easy for everyone to use. ... The good news that an increasing amount of the activity online is encrypted, due to lots of advocacy. ... Increasingly, much of what you do is shielded from third parties because of encryption in place. The ISPs typically — in their efforts to use this data even before this (FCC) rule — have been providing consumers with ISP-level opt-outs. ... People should look for emails — typically they do push out an announcement when they roll out an ad-targeting program. On the regulatory oversight of privacy The FTC has generally been the lead privacy enforcer, and I think has been very aggressive at doing so. If you look at the recent Vizio case, they were able to take very strong action against sharing of your viewing history. ... At the end of the day, the willingness of the FCC and the FTC to use their authority effectively is what will determine whether the consumers are protected. The FCC (has in the past) used even its high-level authority very aggressively, and the FTC certainly historically has. We obviously don't know exactly how the new chairs will. ... On how ISPs' data collection compares to that of Google, Facebook and others The ad networks of the world typically share, swap and trade data via various exchanges. Google and Facebook have policies that to some degree use your data for ad targeting, but may limit the further use of it. For instance, Facebook does not want your Facebook data being shared — they'd like advertisers to come to Facebook to (place) ads on Facebook. All Tech Considered Online Health Searches Aren't Always Confidential That may be a nuance because ... to a consumer, data being used to tailor their experience is probably what makes a difference — whether it's being sold or used in a way that tracks and targets them. So the implementations that we see in the market of ISPs have focused on allowing the ISP to help ad network partners to do a better job of recognizing users. ... I think at the end of the day, for consumers, it ends up being parsing hairs. So the question is ... do the sites I visit get information that allows ads to be targeted based on other information about me? And that information isn't just Web browsing — a big part of ad-targeting today involves pinging on offline data, my actual purchases at a supermarket, my actual transactions. ... So what the advertisers are often looking to do is to work with partners who are able to put them and their offers in front the users they want to reach.

Geoffrey Hinton, who has worked for Google primarily in California since 2013, will soon be working permanently out of the tech giant's Toronto offices and will be the Vector Institute's chief scientific adviser.  (Noah Berger / Associated Press file photo)   By Kate Allen Science and Technology reporter Tues., March 28, 2017 Toronto will host a new institute devoted to artificial intelligence, a major gambit to bolster a field of research pioneered in Canada but consistently drained of talent by major U.S. technology companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft. The Vector Institute, an independent non-profit affiliated with the University of Toronto, will hire about 25 new faculty and research scientists. It will be backed by more than $150 million in public and corporate funding in an unusual hybridization of pure research and business-minded commercial goals. The province will spend $50 million over five years, while the federal government, which announced a $125-million Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy in last week’s budget, is providing at least $40 million, backers say. More than two dozen companies have committed millions more over 10 years, including $5 million each from sponsors including Google, Air Canada, Loblaws, and Canada’s five biggest banks. The mode of artificial intelligence that the Vector Institute will focus on, deep learning, has seen remarkable results in recent years, particularly in image and speech recognition. Geoffrey Hinton, considered the “godfather” of deep learning for the breakthroughs he made while a professor at U of T, has worked for Google since 2013 in California and Toronto. Hinton will move back to Canada to lead a research team based at the tech giant’s Toronto offices and act as chief scientific adviser of the new institute. Article Continued Below “It’s certainly the case that there will be other researchers who will want to come back from the States — I’ve had inquiries from quite a number,” Hinton said. Researchers trained in Canadian artificial intelligence labs fill the ranks of major technology companies, working on tools like instant language translation, facial recognition, and recommendation services. Academic institutions and startups in Toronto, Waterloo, Montreal and Edmonton boast leaders in the field, but other researchers have left for U.S. universities and corporate labs. The goals of the Vector Institute are to retain, repatriate and attract AI talent, to create more trained experts, and to feed that expertise into existing Canadian companies and startups. “We want those firms to grow to be a great worldwide supplier of AI capability, so that we turn this into a service export to the world, and not have a situation where all Canada does is produce PhDs and send them south,” said Ed Clark, chair of the Vector Institute board and adviser to Premier Kathleen Wynne. “We want Toronto, Ontario to be one of the core intellectual centres of artificial intelligence research in the world.” Some members of the institute will be focused purely on research. “We don’t really know where the new big breakthroughs are going to come from in this area,” said Richard Zemel, the institute’s research director and a professor of computer science at U of T. “We want to make sure we are at the forefront of that, so bringing on people who are doing research is really essential.” Others will collaborate with the institute’s business partners. One attraction of the U.S. tech giants is that they host huge amounts of data, the fuel that deep learning algorithms are trained on. Partnering with big companies in Canada, the institute’s creators believe, will provide researchers with massive datasets and interesting problems. Hospitals are expected to be a major partner, since health care is an intriguing application for AI. Last month, researchers from Stanford University announced they had trained a deep learning algorithm to identify potentially cancerous skin lesions with accuracy comparable to human dermatologists. The Toronto company Deep Genomics is using deep learning to read genomes and identify mutations that may lead to disease, among other things. Intelligent algorithms can also be applied to tasks that might seem less virtuous, like reading private data to better target advertising. Zemel says the centre is creating an ethics working group and maintaining ties with organizations that promote fairness and transparency in machine learning. As for privacy concerns, “that’s something we are well aware of. We don’t have a well-formed policy yet but we will fairly soon.” The institute’s annual funding pales in comparison to the revenues of the American tech giants, which are measured in tens of billions. The risk the institute’s backers are taking is simply creating an even more robust machine learning PhD mill for the U.S. “They obviously won’t all stay in Canada, but Toronto industry is very keen to get them,” Hinton said. “I think Trump might help there.” Two researchers on Hinton’s new Toronto-based team are Iranian, one of the countries targeted by U.S. President Donald Trump’s travel bans. “We hear from the community that Canada is a beacon, a beacon for openness and diversity, but also for our respect for research, science, and evidence-based decision making,” said Kirsty Duncan, federal Minister for Science, speaking on Tuesday about the pan-Canadian AI strategy. Hinton’s team is an extension of Google Brain, a research group that has made advances in speech and image recognition underlying tools like Google Translate and image search. The company announced it would open a Google Brain group in Montreal last November. The Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, led by another AI pioneer, Yoshua Bengio, has also received millions in public and private funding, and on Tuesday the Quebec government announced another $100 million for artificial intelligence. “AI is going to bring a lot of wealth, but if it’s made elsewhere we aren’t going to get a reasonable share of that wealth, even if we contributed to the original science,” Bengio said.

Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images Both chambers of the U.S. Congress have voted to overturn the Federal Communications Commission's privacy rules for Internet service providers. Stefan Zaklin/Getty Images President Trump is expected to sign into law a decision by Congress to overturn new privacy rules for Internet service providers. Passed by the Federal Communications Commission in October, the rules never went into effect. If they had, it would have given consumers more control over how ISPs use the data they collect. Most notably, the rules would have required explicit consent from consumers if sensitive data — like financial or health information, or browsing history — were to be shared or sold. Politics Congress Overturns Internet Privacy Regulation These rules wouldn't have applied to the likes of Google or Facebook — massive data collectors and digital advertisers — and that's been a major point of contention for ISPs. But consumer groups argue that's no reason to roll back restrictions on Internet providers. Plus, they point out, you could abandon those companies in favor of other websites, if you disagree with their policies; switching Internet providers is not so easy. ISPs have long attempted to break into the ad-targeting and online marketing world, where the competition is intense. For context on what that market looks like, I turned to Jules Polonetsky, privacy expert and CEO of the Future of Privacy Forum, a nonprofit organization promoting responsible data collection. Below are excerpts of the interview, edited for clarify and length. Interview Highlights On what's going on and what changes All Tech Considered Online Trackers Follow Our Digital Shadow By 'Fingerprinting' Browsers, Devices For the average consumer, just about every site they visit online is sharing data with other ad networks, with other third parties, for the purpose of either measuring or targeting ads. ... Even most privacy organizations end up using Google Analytics or some other basic tools. ... For better or worse, the predominant business model online has become ad-supported. ... So for the average user, the experience isn't likely to change one way or another — today they see ads targeted based on their activity; tomorrow they'll see ads based on their activity. Now, what choices people have maybe has gotten a little bit more complicated. ... ISPs have historically played a very small role in (the ad targeting) market for a range of reasons. The most interesting and valuable data is search, social media data — and that is typically only available to the big portals that have that data. The ISPs don't have it if it's encrypted. ... The big challenge for big advertisers is that their audience is dispersed across laptop, and mobile, and tablet, and TV and elsewhere. And linking that user's identity is a challenge. ... And this is a place where ISPs are able to play a role. ... They now have something to offer — cross-device capabilities — that others can do, but others have to do it differently. ... On existing opt-out options The ad networks of the world offer an opt-out of ad targeting today. If there's a triangle 'i' on your banner ad, that means that that company is tailoring ads based on your Web surfing and is offering you an opt-out. All Tech Considered How Free Web Content Traps People In An Abyss Of Ads And Clickbait Mobile devices offer a bunch of options to allow or not allow information about apps to be used. My iPhone lets me clear my ad ID if I don't want apps to be able to track me or work with their ad network partners to track me. ... Apps don't support cookies, but the ad ID supplied by the operating system — Apple now lets you wipe that out, Google lets you reset it. So that's a pretty effective opt-out system for apps at least. Use of location, similarly. On ISPs' argument that Google, Facebook, et al. are collecting more data and yet have less stringent regulation For better or worse, online data has been democratized and there are third-party ad exchanges where anybody can show up and have access to a big swath of your Web surfing. All Tech Considered Firms Are Buying, Sharing Your Online Info. What Can You Do About It? The BlueKai Bluebook, which is provided to potential advertisers, has 80 sources of data where Oracle's BlueKai data exchange has linked together data from Web surfing, from offline purchases, from all sorts of providers who have pulled data about you that they have online. ... So I've kind of looked at some of this debate with a bit of bemusement because I see the activity in these third-party data markets and that horse is out of that barn. I think for consumers who a more privacy-protective experience, there are a number of options, none of them are perfect — other than, perhaps using a VPN, which may not be easy for everyone to use. ... The good news that an increasing amount of the activity online is encrypted, due to lots of advocacy. ... Increasingly, much of what you do is shielded from third parties because of encryption in place. The ISPs typically — in their efforts to use this data even before this (FCC) rule — have been providing consumers with ISP-level opt-outs. ... People should look for emails — typically they do push out an announcement when they roll out an ad-targeting program. On the regulatory oversight of privacy The FTC has generally been the lead privacy enforcer, and I think has been very aggressive at doing so. If you look at the recent Vizio case, they were able to take very strong action against sharing of your viewing history. ... At the end of the day, the willingness of the FCC and the FTC to use their authority effectively is what will determine whether the consumers are protected. The FCC (has in the past) used even its high-level authority very aggressively, and the FTC certainly historically has. We obviously don't know exactly how the new chairs will. ... On how ISPs' data collection compares to that of Google, Facebook and others The ad networks of the world typically share, swap and trade data via various exchanges. Google and Facebook have policies that to some degree use your data for ad targeting, but may limit the further use of it. For instance, Facebook does not want your Facebook data being shared — they'd like advertisers to come to Facebook to (place) ads on Facebook. All Tech Considered Online Health Searches Aren't Always Confidential That may be a nuance because ... to a consumer, data being used to tailor their experience is probably what makes a difference — whether it's being sold or used in a way that tracks and targets them. So the implementations that we see in the market of ISPs have focused on allowing the ISP to help ad network partners to do a better job of recognizing users. ... I think at the end of the day, for consumers, it ends up being parsing hairs. So the question is ... do the sites I visit get information that allows ads to be targeted based on other information about me? And that information isn't just Web browsing — a big part of ad-targeting today involves pinging on offline data, my actual purchases at a supermarket, my actual transactions. ... So what the advertisers are often looking to do is to work with partners who are able to put them and their offers in front the users they want to reach. Sometimes, that's "here's the Web browsing history," which they can get from an exchange, or they can get by going on one of the big portals, or presumably they'll be able to get by going to ISPs. The market doesn't think about it in terms of selling data — the market thinks about it in terms of "how does an advertiser find the audience that it thinks it wants." ... And different providers in the market will create those audiences. On what users can do to restrict or entirely limit their data from being collected It pays to opt out of the behavioral advertising, when you see that triangle 'i' because thousands of companies will at least not target you — they may still be collecting data, but they're not gonna be tailoring the ads that you see.

The Senate approved a similar measure last week, and President Trump will soon accept the rollback. You may have heard about this because privacy advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (and virtual private network services smelling blood and profit opportunity) have sounded the alarm, noting that rolling back these rules would theoretically allow internet-service providers to share potentially sensitive data without the knowledge of consumers. The telecom industry, for its part, has strongly pushed back against not only these regulations but also the EFF and others’ characterization of them, using a mishmash of arguments about federal authority and fairness regarding “edge providers” — that is, big websites and service providers like Google and Facebook. At the very least, in no uncertain terms, the government is rolling back privacy regulations meant to protect consumers against invasive data mining. The question is, what does this mean for you? What is going on here? Last December, before President Trump was inaugurated into office, the FCC adopted a policy with the catchy name “Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services.” Among other measures, this required broadband providers to get customer consent, also known as “opt-in,” before those customers’ internet-usage data — including browsing history and geolocation information — could be shared with third parties. Congress is now exercising its authority under the Congressional Review Act, which allows it to reject policies adopted by regulatory agencies, to toss this rule out. I’ve heard this means ISPs can just sell my entire online history to advertisers. Is that true? There are a few things to clear up here: First and foremost, the rules being nullified were adopted last fall. They are not long-standing privacy regulations being disabled amid the Trump regime — though, the fact that the party of small government is in control of Congress and the White House surely helps. The telecom industry’s position is that its responsibility regarding your data is already regulated under Section 222 of Title 47 of the U.S. Code (though those regulations have more to do with proprietary networking data than user browsing history). All of which is to say that the hypothetical doomsday scenario — that ISPs will sell your whole browsing history, tied to your name and identity, to whoever wants it, the minute this vote is completed in congress — will not come to fruition. Rather, it indicates that ISPs would like to do what Google and Facebook, not covered by the new FCC rules, are already doing: sell anonymized profiles based on data those companies gather to third parties for ad targeting. Even if you’re comfortable with the amount of data that Google and Facebook are collecting on you and repackaging for sale — and you may not even be aware of it — the idea of ISPs doing the same thing is likely to be even more discomfiting: Google can only track you across sites that it owns or has contributed code to; your ISP can track your entire internet-browsing history. What is the telecom industry’s stance on customer privacy? Several broadband providers contacted for this story said that they supported their trade organization’s stance in support of the CRA rollback, but insisted they’re transparent with their customers about how data is handled. Thomas Larsen of Mediacom said that the FCC’s 2016 rules are a “smoke and mirrors policy that pretended to address a consumer issue,” while also adding that, “Cable operators have grown up in a world where the sharing of personally identifiable consumer information is not allowed, and we have no intention of sharing that information moving forward.” Rich Young, from Verizon, stated in part that “Verizon has several advertising and marketing programs, and customers are able to make choices about participating in these programs,” and directed me to their privacy policy. (You know, the long block of legalese that everyone definitely reads before signing up for online services.) Other major broadband providers directed me to statements from trade organizations like NCTA, CTIA, and US Telecom. The latter said in its statement that, “Consumers deserve a single, clear framework for how their private online information is protected and consistent standards for how — or if — data can be shared by companies.” What’s their argument for rolling back privacy regs? In a conference call with the media today, NCTA experts defended the industry group’s stance in support of tossing out the FCC regulations. (A clerical note: NCTA formerly stood for National Cable & Telecommunications Association, but is now known as the Internet & Television Association. But it is still known as the NCTA in short.) Their arguments were twofold (and, if I’m being honest, lackluster). First, they reached back five years to 2012, when President Obama named the Federal Trade Commission, and not the Federal Communications Commission, the government body in charge of determining consumer online-privacy rights. In other words, the NCTA does not believe that the FCC has jurisdiction on this issue, despite the fact that they are the body with the authority to regulate ISP practices. Secondly, the telecom industry believes that it’s being unfairly targeted (boo-hoo), while Google, Facebook, and other enormous, data-hoovering advertising companies are being ignored. The NCTA believes that it needs to “hit the reset button” on privacy regulations, working partially off of FCC guidance from the middle of 2015. The trade org’s attitude is that any privacy regulations that don’t address edge providers like Facebook and Google are insufficient. Which, okay, sure — but that doesn’t seem like a great argument for rolling back those regulations entirely. (Asked on a conference call whether or not the NCTA would support similar privacy rules that also covered edge providers, the NCTA’s representatives hedged.) Are ISPs and edge providers equivalent? There’s no doubt Facebook and Google, whose businesses are founded on selling targeted ads based on your browsing history, are presiding over privacy minefields. But the equation of broadband providers and edge providers ignores the fact that ISPs often have monopolies that edge providers do not. Thanks to decades of consolidation and a high cost of entry, the telecom industry is not a particularly competitive field; people can use the internet without using Facebook, but consumers often have little to no choice in who their actual internet provider is. Given the lack of regional competition in the telecom industry, I asked the NCTA why consumers should trust companies that know they have a captive user base. “We operate in ways that promote transparency and try to provide consumers with options for informed choice. That was true before there were FCC rules and that will be true after FCC rules go away,” said James Assey, the NCTA’s executive vice-president. It is, as far as we know, true that an internet-service provider has yet to exploit its customers’ data in a particularly craven and greedy manner. It is also true that ISPs are pushing back on regulations that ensure it stays this way, and that a lack of industry competition means consumers can’t express their dissatisfaction by leaving a given ISP. And it’s clear where the industry is headed: Last August, in a regulatory filing, Comcast proposed discounted internet rates in exchange for collecting more user data. But maybe we’re wrong and the telecom industry is really committed to consumer privacy. With any luck, it’ll follow through on its stated preference for comprehensive, uniform privacy regulations requiring both edge providers and ISPs to handle consumer data responsibly. Then again, Time Warner told you it’d be there between noon and two. Is there anything I can do to avoid being tracked by my ISP? Your best option is to use a virtual private network, which anonymizes your internet activity by routing it through another hub. There are hundreds of VPN subscription services out there, or — if you’re technically minded — you can roll your own.

According to research analysts at Technavio, the global market was valued at $4.73 billion in 2016, and is expected to reach 13.63 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 23.57%. Currently North America has the largest share of the market at 36.79%, but Europe will likely make the highest contribution to the market’s growth with a CAGR of 24.19%. One indication of this is a move by the European Banking Authority (EBA) to require “strong customer authentication” for all electronic payments over €10 (or about $10.60 USD). With the average online retail purchase in Europe being over $85, this proposed standard would create substantial demand for services such as TFA, requiring many retailers to adapt their checkout processes. Internet giants such as Facebook and Google are also implementing TFA, though this is currently optional rather than a requirement. Facebook recently announced that it will support USB keys for TFA, as an alternative to sending a code to the user’s mobile device. The social media company has already offered TFA for several years, but the option to use a USB key makes the service more flexible. Google has also recently added to its security options, making it possible for IT administrators to require a company’s employees and other users to authenticate with a security key. This provides the protection of TFA without the need for mobile apps or text messages, and is the highest level of security available under this system. Google’s newest move addresses one of the challenges associated with TFA: it’s inconvenient. Many people object to having to go through an additional step whenever they need to log in, even if that step is relatively quick and simple. By allowing security keys, Google alleviates this somewhat. Consumer resistance to TFA is one of the factors making retailers apprehensive about the EBA’s proposal to increase security. The concern is that consumers will be more likely to abandon their shopping carts and not go through with online purchases because of the added step. Technavio reasearchers believe that this challenge can actually be an opportunity for TFA, however. It means there is space in the market for more tools to streamline the process and make it faster and more user-friendly. If the EBA introduces this new standard, there will be significant new demand for secure, customer-friendly TFA solutions. Organisations outside of Europe will also likely adopt these solutions for their own purposes. So even though TFA is not universally loved, the market still offers many opportunities for innovative companies.

The technology firm also confirmed that it has reached its target early, and has set itself to train even more Africans in digital skills in the coming year. The Digital Skills programme offers 89 courses through the online portal, and Google works with 14 training partners covering more than 20 countries to offer face to face training. The programme is expected to address needs for small business owners, who are looking to better understand how to take advantage of the web across Africa. Digital tutorials Accordingly, Google will add web-focused skills training for SMEs across Africa as part of this initiative. In addition to the new target, Google is extending its commitment to the Digital Skills programme by assisting local communities further in several ways including provision of offline versions of its online training materials to reach individuals and businesses in low access areas where it is unable to hold physical training sessions. Additionally, Google would provide offline versions of the content in languages like Hausa, Swahili and IsiZulu. Speaking on the new development, Google Nigeria country manager Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor, in a press conference in Lagos last week, said that the web is a driver of economic growth, transforming society as a whole. “People must be equipped, through training and reskilling to make use of the tools, and take advantage of it for entrepreneurship, employment and e-inclusion. Our goal with this and previous web training initiatives is to enable more people across the continent better understand how to leverage the Web tools for growth – to give them access to better employment and/or the skills to start their own businesses.”   The post Google raises digital literacy in Africa, trains 1m on various skills appeared first on Vanguard News.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology Apple iPad (2017) vs. Google Pixel C Emily Ferron March 28, 2017 How does the newest, cheapest iPad compare to the pricey Android-running Google Pixel C? View gallery - 23 images Last week, Apple unveiled its most affordable iPad to date. Here's how the features and specs of the newest 9.7-inch iPad compare to those of the Google Pixel C, one of the most premium Android-running tablets on the market. Size Sick of Ads? New Atlas Plus offers subscribers an ad free experience. It's just US$19 a year.More Information When both of the tablets are held in the portrait orientation, the Pixel C is slightly taller and about 5-percent wider. However, the iPad is the thicker device – it's half a millimeter thicker than the Pixel C, and it's thicker than its predecessor, the iPad Air 2, as well. Weight The Pixel C is the heavier tablet, which could make a meaningful difference when you're holding it in one hand or toting it in a bag with other essentials. It weighs about 9-percent more. Build Both makers stick with uncomplicated aluminum unibody builds. Colors The iPad is available in three metallic color variants, while the Google Pixel C is offered only in silver. Display size The Pixel C display, with its 10.2-inch diagonal and 1:1.4 aspect ratio, offers about 8-percent more overall screen area than the 9.7-inch, 4:3 iPad. Display resolution The Pixel C has a higher pixel density, so it should have a sharper-looking display. In Apple's defense, however, resolution is not the only indicator of display quality. Speakers Both tablets have stereo speakers. Fingerprint sensor The iPad has a fingerprint sensor built into the home button for easy, secure logins. The Pixel C is not equipped for any kind of biometric access. Cellular connectivity option The iPad is available in both Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + LTE variants, but the Pixel C doesn't offer any built-in cellular connectivity options. Keyboard support Unlike its sibling the iPad Pro, this iPad does not have any Smart Connectors for connecting to keyboard accessories, though it does support third-party Bluetooth keyboards. On the other hand, Google makes two optional snap-on keyboard options for the Pixel C, which retail for US$149 each. The advantage of a docking keyboard? It draws power from the tablet, and does not need to be charged individually. Active stylus support Neither of these options support active stylus input. Charging/data port The iPad uses Apple's Lightning connector, while the Pixel C has a more-universal USB Type C charging port. Processor We're not yet sure about the clock speeds for the A9 chip in the new iPad – we'll know better once the tablets start shipping and benchmarks become available. However, the two chips are shaping up to have very similar speeds. RAM The Pixel C likely has more RAM than the iPad, but to be fair, the two operating systems use RAM differently. Apple doesn't publish the amount of RAM in its mobile devices, but chances are, this one has the same 2 GB amount as its other 9.7-inch tablets. We'll know for sure once device tear downs become available. Storage The new iPad is available with either 32 GB or 128 GB of built-in storage. When the Pixel C was first introduced, it came in 32 GB and 64 GB options, but these days, the 32 GB option has vanished from the Google Store and is hard to come by on the US market. MicroSD Neither tablet accommodates expandable storage via microSD. Camera megapixels Photography isn't usually a selling point for tablets, but regardless, these two are neck-and-neck in terms of camera resolution. The Pixel C packs in more pixels in the front-facing camera for a slight advantage in the selfie and Skype department. Battery Battery size and life expectancy are also on par with one another. Both makers offer an "up to 10 hours" estimate, though of course actual performance varies with how the device is being used. Software Naturally, the iPad runs the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 10. The Pixel C was released with Android Marshmallow but has since received the Android Nougat update. As a Google-branded device, it should be one of the first in line for software updates in the near future. Multitasking Both operating systems allow a certain degree of multitasking, by allowing the user to view/use more than one app at a time. Release In the US, the iPad is expected to start shipping and hitting shelves at the end of this week. The Pixel C made its first appearance almost a year and a half ago. Starting price The entry-level iPad is nearly half the price of a brand new Pixel C. Originally, the 32 GB Pixel C was being offered for $499, but since it's no longer readily available, we're referring only to the price for the 64 GB size. Stay tuned for a full-length review of the latest iPad (that's just "iPad", no suffixes), which has replaced the iPad Air 2 in Apple's tablet lineup. For an incrementally better equipped (but more expensive) Apple tablet, you could also consider the 9.7-inch iPad Pro.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Gcam is your Google Pixel’s camera software, a software project that dreamt big By John Hoff - March 28, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter It started in 2011, when the Google Glass project gave its engineers some challenges regarding the camera rigged onto the pair of glasses. The Gcam project was built specifically to solve Google Glass’s imaging issues, but it soon became apparent that the project was meant for bigger and better things. Google Glass had a problem, the camera on the wearable was small – because it was eyewear and a bigger lens was not an option. It also had very little computing power, and it utilized a mobile camera sensor, which all pointed to crappy, high-contrast images, especially in low-light situations. Enter Marc Levoy, who led his team to approach the problem from the software side of things. The rest is history. The solution was to take a rapid sequence of shots and then fuse them to create a single, higher quality image. We know this technique as HDR in today’s terms, but this was not easily available for mobile devices in 2011, especially for Google Glass. The technique gave allowed Glass users to take images with greater detail, greater clarity and brighter, sharper pictures overall. The technology was such a big hit that it debuted as HDR+ in the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 6 in 2014. And now very recently, Gcam’s HDR+ technology was used in Google’s revolutionary new smartphone – the Pixel. The results speak for itself – DxOMark rated the Google Pixel as having “the best smartphone camera ever made” in the year 2016. It still sits on top of the rankings as of today.

Internet providers now just need a signature from President Trump before they're free to take, share, and even sell your web browsing history without your permission. The House of Representatives passed a resolution today overturning an Obama-era FCC rule that required internet providers to get customers' permission before sharing their browsing history with other companies. The rules also required internet providers to protect that data from hackers and inform customers of any breaches. The resolution was first passed by the Senate last week and now heads to the president, who's expected to sign it. At that point, there'll only be a vague baseline of privacy rules governing internet providers and some promises from them not to misbehave. MORE FROM THE VERGE The Hawai'ian volcano that created a spectacular firehose of lava just collapsed Apple, Facebook, Google, and 94 others file opposition to Trump's immigration ban Google's Super Bowl ad accidentally set off a lot of Google Homes It's hard to see this as anything but a major loss for consumers. While reversing the FCC's privacy rules will technically just maintain the status quo — internet providers have actually been able to sell your web browsing data forever (it's just not a thing we think about all that much) — they were about to lose permission to keep doing it, unless they got explicit consent or anonymized the info. This is an increasingly important issue as Americans spend more and more time online — and keep more and more devices with them at all times. Internet providers can see what sites you visit and what apps you use, and they can see how long you're using them for. That information is extremely revealing, and it's easy to imagine most people would prefer to keep their reading habits private. "The consequences of passing this resolution are clear: broadband providers like AT&T, Comcast, and others will be able to sell your personal information to the highest bidder without your permission," said Representative Anna Eshoo (D-CA) on the House floor this afternoon. "And no one will be able to protect you, not even the Federal Trade Commission that our friends on the other side of the aisle keep talking about." So why did Congress block the rules from being implemented? Republicans bought into internet providers' arguments that the rules discriminated against them and could confuse consumers. The rules would prevent internet providers from selling your web browsing history even though, the argument goes, websites like Google and Facebook would remain free to do the same thing. ISPs say that's unfair and makes it hard for consumers to understand who gets to see their browsing data. Internet providers want to pretend they're just like Google and Facebook But the argument is extremely misleading, if not outright wrong: Google and Facebook can't see your web browsing history, they can only see what you click on while you're on their own websites or on websites connected to their ad networks. Meanwhile, internet providers get to see a bit of nearly everything you do and visit; and even with the rules in place, they have every right to build the kind of ad-tracking websites that Google and Facebook have built. It's just hard work, and they don't want to do it. The rules, if anything, put internet providers on a level playing field with companies like Facebook and Google. But Republicans don't like that it creates more work for them. "These rules do little to enhance privacy but clearly add a layer of red tape on innovators and job creators," Representative Greg Walden (R-OR), chair of the House's commerce committee, said ahead of the vote. The rules, he said, "have the potential to stifle one of the most innovative sectors of our economy." This was a surprisingly common line of argument from Republican representatives, who continually conflated internet providers with companies that build businesses connected to the internet. They frequently took issue with creating a distinction between these two types of companies, despite the fact the huge distinction exists: ISPs like Comcast essentially create digital roads, while companies like Google create hugely innovative businesses along those roads. There's good reason to treat the two differently. Republicans say the privacy rules are too confusing Republicans and internet providers also complained that the FCC's rules didn't perfectly align with the Federal Trade Commission's privacy framework, which governed internet providers up until the 2015 net neutrality order went into effect. In reality, the differences are slight — the real argument here is just over ISP's ability to share your browsing history. Representative Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), chair of the House subcommittee on communications and technology, actually claimed that removing the rules would improve privacy by closing that distinction. "Consumer privacy will continue to be protected and will actually be enhanced by removing the uncertainty and confusion these rules will create," she said. With these rules all-but killed, the FCC will now be left without any firm regulations for internet providers on the books. The commission may now go about proposing and passing a weaker set of restrictions that better match up with what the FTC has on the books. This is a huge loss for consumer privacy In a statement following the vote, FCC chairman Ajit Pai indicated his approval of Congress' action, saying the rules — which he voted against last year — represented commission "overreach" and were "designed to benefit one group of favored companies over another group of disfavored companies." Pai reiterated his intention to realign the FCC's rules with the FTC's weaker privacy framework. But how that'll happen is unclear. Pai says the FCC will work with the FTC, but he also says he'd prefer to just kill the 2015 net neutrality order so that the FCC doesn't have a say over privacy at all. In an added blow to privacy advocates, the FCC won't be able to pass privacy restrictions protecting all web browsing history again, since the resolution prevents it. Though the commission will, it seems, still be able to block internet providers from sharing info related to children, banking, or medical history, which the FTC considered sensitive in the first place.

Roston - Mar 28, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google has introduced new integrations for its Google Home product, making it possible for owners to use Google Assistant with a slew of new products. Google Home, of course, is the company’s somewhat new competitor to Amazon Echo, giving users hands-free access to the Google Assistant product. These integrations go a long way toward making Google Home a suitable device for controlling a smart home, including everything from lighting to heat. A bunch of products received Google Home support today, including TP-Link, Wink, LIFX, Best Buy Insignia, and more. Those with these supported products and Google Home can, for example, say something like, “OK Google, turn on the fan,” and have the device communicate with the Insignia Smart Plug to turn on a fan plugged into it. That’s one example of the wide range of possibilities these integrations hold. The TP-Link integration brings support for smart lighting products, meaning you can dim the lights or change the color (depending on bulb) using your voice rather than pulling out your phone. The same goes for LIFX connected bulbs, and Wink’s array of heating and lighting offerings. Those integrations are available now, but a handful of companies have announced plans to introduce integrations in the near future. Vivint Smart Home, for example, will be the first smart home service provider to offer Google Assistant support. This integration will begin in April. As well, the August Smart Lock now works with Google Assistant on Google Home, enabling owners to say something like, “OK Google, ask August if my door is locked.” The same is true for Rachio’s Smart Sprinkler, the first product of its kind to get Google Assistant support. This integration will arrive next month, as well. In a similar vein, insurance company Progressive recently announced that it is the first insurer to support Google Assistant, enabling users to ask it questions related to the company’s services. Anova’s Precision Cooker Bluetooth + WiFi will get Google Home integration starting next week, and it is joined by integrations for Geeni, First Alert, Logitech, and Frigidaire.

 House Republicans just voted to let your internet provider sell your browsing history without your permission Jeff Dunn Mar. 28, 2017, 5:59 PM 15,138 facebook linkedin twitter email print Republican senator Jeff Flake of Arizona.tAP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin The US House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to kill a set of Obama-era privacy regulations for internet service providers created by the Federal Communications Commission last October. The most notable part of the rules, which has not yet taken effect, would require broadband providers such as Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T to obtain explicit consent before selling their customers’ web-browsing histories, app-usage data, and other personal information to advertisers and other third-parties. The resolution was adopted in a 215 to 205 vote, with most Republicans in favor of the repeal and most Democrats against. The House was voting on S.J. Res. 34, a resolution proposed earlier this month by Republican senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and co-sponsored by 24 other Republicans that broadly calls for the FCC’s rules to “have no force or effect.” The resolution was passed by the Senate in a 50-48 party line vote last Thursday. The resolution still needs to be signed by President Donald Trump before becoming law, though that appears to be a formality after the White House expressed its support for the repeal on Tuesday. The resolution was proposed via the Congressional Review Act, a traditionally seldom-used law that Republicans have used more than a half-dozen times this year to repeal regulations passed by federal agencies late in the Obama administration. Because the resolution was approved using the Congressional Review Act, the FCC will be barred from creating similar privacy regulations for internet providers, provided Trump does not have a change of heart. What was at stake, and where Republicans and Democrats differ The FCC’s privacy rules were approved in a 3-2 party line vote last October after months of debate. They were created as an addendum of sorts to the 2015 Open Internet Order. That order classified the internet as a public utility and implemented the current net-neutrality rules — which legally prevent ISPs from blocking, throttling, or prioritizing websites as they see fit — but also left jurisdiction of ISPs’ privacy policies up to the FCC, instead of the Federal Trade Commission, where it had been previously. Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai.Reuters/Kevin Lamarque The FCC’s privacy rules imposed a range of guidelines on internet providers regarding how they treat and protect consumer data. The most notable bit would’ve required them to obtain opt-in consent from consumers before they were able to sell “sensitive” information. Much of what the FCC deemed “sensitive” lined up with items noted similarly in the FTC’s privacy guidelines, including things like geolocation data, financial information, and health information. Notably, however, the FCC said that web-browsing and app-usage data are sensitive enough to require consumers’ explicit permission before being shared with advertisers as well. That specific provision is not scheduled to take effect until December, though. It’s now extremely unlikely that it ever will take effect, but if it does, your internet provider will have to ask for permission before it's allowed to collect and sell your browsing data and other personal info to advertisers.   Even with the FCC’s slightly stricter privacy guidelines, internet providers would still be able to collect and sell some types of personal data, such as email addresses, without seeking permission first. Consumers would be able to manually opt-out of such policies. FCC chairman Ajit Pai and other Republicans oppose the agency’s privacy rules because they feel the regulations unfairly target internet service providers more than internet companies such as Google and Facebook. Those kind of companies’ privacy policies are regulated under the looser FTC guidelines, which do not recommend opt-in consent for web-browsing and app-usage history. This is part of why you may see ads personalized to your browsing history as you surf the web.  Internet service providers feel this discrepancy gives those companies an unjust leg up in the digital advertising space. Groups representing ISPs previously petitioned the FCC to repeal the privacy rules altogether, and return jurisdiction of their privacy policies to the FTC. President Donald Trump.AP Photo/Andrew Harnik The rollback comes at a time when internet service providers such as Verizon and Comcast are increasingly looking to boost their digital advertising presence. Google and Facebook currently dominate the digital advertising market. Though the FCC’s privacy rules do not apply to them, groups representing those internet companies previously requested Congress to repeal the regulations, mainly because they do not want the rules to set a precedent for how their data collection policies may be governed in the future. GOP officials say that the FCC overstepped its bounds as a federal agency by creating the privacy rules, and that the regulations are too burdensome for internet providers. Deregulatory-minded Republicans have frequently used this line of attack toward Obama-era FCC policies since the 2015 net-neutrality order. Democrats and consumer advocacy groups argue that the imbalance in privacy regulation is justified because internet providers are more easily capable of seeing everything a consumer does over their internet connection. (Though it's worth noting that companies like Google and Facebook are capable of tracking customers beyond their own websites to an extent.) Democrats also argue that it is generally more difficult to switch internet providers than switch websites, particularly in rural or lower-income areas where competition between ISPs is scarce. They also note that websites like Google and Facebook provide largely free services in exchange for their data collection and targeted ads, whereas ISPs charge fees for their core services. It all comes back to Title II Pai and other GOP members want to return both broadband providers and internet companies to the FTC’s less-stringent privacy rules. Pai, like many Republicans, is a noted critic of how the 2015 net-neutrality order reclassified broadband providers as “common carriers” — that is, companies that deliver a public utility, which the internet is now considered after the 2015 order — and says it has depressed investment in broadband networks. (Though the jury may still be out on that.) In general, Pai has opposed most of the major FCC policies passed during the Obama administration, many of which have put ISPs under a more critical legal microscope. He has called for a "light-touch" approach to regulation in response. In February, for instance, he stopped an inquiry into the "zero-rating" practices of certain broadband providers, which critics say violate the spirit of the net-neutrality laws.  REUTERS/Rick Wilking However, until he or GOP members of Congress are able to undo the net-neutrality order, Pai has expressed a desire to create a privacy framework that is consistent with the FTC’s less-stringent guidelines. Pai echoed this sentiment in a statement applauding the House vote on Tuesday. "Last year, the Federal Communications Commission pushed through, on a party-line vote, privacy regulations designed to benefit one group of favored companies over another group of disfavored companies," he said. "Appropriately, Congress has passed a resolution to reject this approach of picking winners and losers before it takes effect." But if Trump signs the resolution, there are currently doubts as to whether or not broadband providers will be legally subject to privacy-related regulation from either the FCC or the FTC. In the former’s case, Pai has said the FCC will still be able to enforce ISPs’ privacy policies on a case-by-case basis using Title II, Section 222 of the Communications Act. That grants the FCC authority over ISPs’ treatment of consumer data on a broader level, but it was written in 1996 with telephone services in mind, and makes no specific mention of things like web-browsing or app-usage data. Title II is also the classification that gave the FCC much of its legal authority over ISPs through the 2015 net-neutrality order. It is what Pai and the GOP most strongly oppose about that order. If that jurisdiction is weakened, it could nullify the FCC’s ability to use Sec. 222 for privacy regulation of ISPs in the first place. If the net-neutrality order does stay in place — thus leaving the FCC in charge of ISPs' privacy regulations — it'd be unclear how far the FCC could go in writing new privacy rules in the future if Trump signs the resolution. Because the resolution uses the Congressional Review Act, the FCC would be prevented from writing any privacy rules that are “substantially similar” to the ones that are now close to being abolished. That could take any FCC requirement regarding opt-in consent for web-browsing and app-usage data off the books for good. Reuters Meanwhile, the FTC’s ability to regulate broadband providers is currently in doubt thanks to an appeals-court ruling last year that said AT&T was exempt from FTC jurisdiction altogether due to its status as a “common carrier.” That, again, is a title that was applied to all broadband providers through the 2015 net-neutrality order. The GOP could rectify that in part by undoing the net-neutrality rules, but since some ISPs like AT&T and Verizon offer mobile telephone services in addition to broadband, they would still be considered “common carriers,” and thus could still be exempt from FTC oversight per the appeals court ruling. This could make legally requiring certain ISPs to obtain either opt-in or opt-out consent for any sensitive information tricky. (ISPs such Charter and Comcast that do not provide phone services would be more affected.) Further Congressional action would then be needed to return FTC oversight to all ISPs’ privacy practices, should it come to that. Along those lines, Republican representative Bob Latta of Ohio said on Tuesday that he plans to introduce legislation that'd return some jurisdiction of common carriers to the FTC. But it remains to be seen how far that'd go, or, as is likely, if it'd still require the GOP to undo the 2015 net-neutrality order — and thus remove the common carrier label from all internet providers — to let the FTC legally enforce ISPs' privacy policies completely.  Numerous House Democrats excoriated the resolution on Tuesday as taking too much control over personal data out of consumers' hands. "This resolution is of the swamp, and for the swamp, and no-one else," said Democratic representative Michael Doyle of Pennsylvania, referring to prior requests from broadband and internet company groups to repeal the privacy rules. In any case, it does not look like broadband providers will need your permission before selling your web-browsing and app-usage histories any time soon. Though it doesn’t change much about how you interact with the internet today, the privacy rules' apparent demise is a long-term victory for ISPs, advertisers, and internet companies, a lost opportunity for privacy hawks, and the latest step in an overarching GOP rollback of the internet regulations set by the FCC during the Obama administration.

Explore more:  customer experience customer service and social media social customer service Customer Experience Management The Customer Was Front and Center at Social Media Marketing World 2017 March 28, 2017 Dan Gingiss Change was in the air at Social Media Marketing World in San Diego last week. For a conference that - as the name suggests - focuses on marketing, a distinct theme emerged in year five of the industry’s largest annual get-together: Customer Experience. Social Media Examiner CEO Michael Stelzner called social media the "fastest-changing industry on the planet" in his opening keynote, “Social Media Marketing in 2017: What the Newest Research Reveals”. He spoke at length about the sophisticated algorithms at Facebook and Google that “are a nightmare for marketers”. Why are algorithms a nightmare? Because “Google and Facebook want people to see quality content,” Stelzner said. “Algorithms are designed to help consumers, not marketers.” Translation: Google and Facebook are focused on the customer experience, even if it means frustrating the advertisers that keep them in business. The answer, Stelzner revealed, is that “companies should refocus on their community by being helpful”. This is a fundamental change for advertisers and marketers, who are used to being able to shout their message with a bullhorn. In social media, people get to talk back, so marketers have to do more than sell. They have to create content that's useful, engaging, and generally additive to customers’ lives. Scott Monty, a social media and marketing consultant, blogger, and podcaster, emphatically reiterated this point in his presentation entitled, “Why We’ve Failed: The Customer Is No Longer Our Focus”. “Social media was supposed to get us more customer-focused, personalized and conversational,” he said, “but we've lost our way”. He noted that “trust matters” because consumers today trust someone they know more than anyone else and "all it takes us one misstep and trust disappears”. Citing the Roman philosopher Cicero, Monty said that marketing should “think my thoughts, feel my feelings, speak my words” and that brands must be authentic, responsive, and compelling in their communications to consumers. But beyond that, companies need to start with a great product. "You're not going to get anywhere if you have a crappy product or service," he said, adding that “social media amplifies what's wrong with your business”. His answer? Make your customer feel like a “king or queen” for a day to show them how much you care about them. Now that sounds like a great customer experience. Joey Coleman, a recognized expert in customer experience design, would agree. Coleman, who delivered a stellar keynote on the big stage in front of more than 3,000 people, talked about “Turning Customers into Life-Long Advocates in the First 100 Days”. "We subject our customers to a roller coaster of emotions every time they do business with us," he began, citing some downright scary statistics - including the fact that between 20% and 70% of customers leave a given business within the first 100 days. But if they stay until day 101, he added, customers will remain loyal to the company for an average of 5 more years. "If you don't prioritize your client, someone else will,” Coleman warned, adding that if companies create remarkable experiences in real life, it will translate into social media when customers share with friends and followers. Customer experience thought leader Blake Morgan concurred in her presentation, suggesting that “everyone from the CEO down needs to understand their customers' lives and how they experience the brand”. “Your digital strategy must consider the life your customer is living. How will you leverage digital to make your customers' lives better?” she asked. Even presentations with titles that had nothing to do with customer experience focused heavily on listening to customers and catering to their wants and needs. In her talk entitled, “How to Create Breakthrough Written Marketing Content,” MarketingProfs Chief Content Officer Ann Handley reminded marketers that “the reader isn’t thinking what you’re thinking” and asked the audience to take a pledge that they “will have pathological empathy for the reader". Not coincidentally, empathy is perhaps the #1 characteristic of a superstar customer service agent. Handley also cited Simple Bank as a great example of a seamless customer experience, noting that they even take legally required language and make it fun and understandable for the customer. Similarly, in his presentation entitled, “Growth Hacking: How to Use Social Media to Rapidly Grow Your New Business or Product,” social media consultant and author Neal Schaffer told his audience: "If you really want to be successful at social media marketing, you need to pivot with communities." In other words, listen to what the audience wants and deliver that. "Social media is a huge focus group that's free," he added. Schaffer shared an example of car maker Acura taking a picture of customers in their new car while it’s still in the showroom and sending it to them so they’ll share it on their social media channels. This isn’t just a marketing ploy; it’s also a way for Acura to extend the customer experience beyond the showroom, exposing it to a broader audience. And when Marcus Sheridan, the content marketing genius and self-proclaimed “Sales Lion”, took the stage for his session on “7 Powerful Strategies for Building a World-Class Content Marketing Plan,” he focused on – you guessed it – the customer. "It doesn't matter what we want to tell them, it matters what they want to know," he said, adding that “the most powerful content marketing tool in the world is your ears”. The fact is that both social media and marketing are important parts of the overall customer experience, which, by definition, includes every single interaction a customer has with a brand. What's become clear to many of the distinguished speakers at this year’s Social Media Marketing World is that by focusing on the customer, we can not only improve our marketing and increase sales, we can keep our customers happier, longer.

The Insider Breakfast with Google, which is still accepting registrations for marketing professionals and business executives through Wednesday, will take place at Worcester's Hanover Theatre and focus on ways businesses can better target customers and use data to sell their products and services. MassLive Media Director of Digital Solutions Rob Madrid will deliver a talk on how businesses can use "big data" to better learn about their customer base. And Google Strategic Partner Manager Matt Targett will discuss how businesses can take advantage of "micro-moments," reaching customers and clients when they are most receptive to doing business. "We look forward to giving Worcester-area businesses this unique opportunity to hear from a top-flight Google executive and experts in digital marketing," MassLive Media Regional Sales Director Gareth Charter said in a statement. "I promise it will be an educational and actionable morning."

Now, with the wider rollout of the new location sharing feature coming to Google Maps, this functionality has been removed from the social network. After updating to the newest version of Google Plus, if you head into the application and tap the “Locations” tab, you will be greeted with a new message telling you to use Google Maps. The issue with this, though, is that the location sharing feature hasn’t made its way to every Android and iOS device quite yet. Now that the location sharing feature has been removed from Google Plus, it appears that more Google Maps users are starting to see the feature pop up in their apps, however. You can check if you’ve received it by opening Google Maps and then tapping on the menu icon in the top left corner. If it has been enabled, you should see a “Share location” button highlighted by a bright blue “New” icon. Simply tap on it and the app will walk you through setting everything up. Unfortunately, if you haven’t received the Google Maps update, you are out of luck until it does show up. Google does have another application called Trusted Contacts that allows you to share your location with a select number of people but, unfortunately, it is currently an Android exclusive and you can only share you location with others who have the app installed.

Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services As you can see for yourself over at the new site, the site offers a comprehensive list of Google’s open source projects, information on the organization’s outreach efforts and affiliations, a full 70-page look at the Mountain View company’s internal open source documentation, and more. This new site showcases the breadth and depth of our love for open source. It will contain the expected things: our programs, organizations we support, and a comprehensive list of open source projects we’ve released. But it also contains something unexpected: a look under the hood at how we “do” open source. One of the main motivators behind the site, Google says, is “helping you find interesting open source.” As a result, we have released thousands of projects under open source licenses ranging from larger products like TensorFlow, Go, and Kubernetes to smaller projects such as Light My Piano, Neuroglancer and Periph.io. Some are fully supported while others are experimental or just for fun. With so many projects spread across 100 GitHub organizations and our self-hosted Git service, it can be difficult to see the scope and scale of our open source footprint. You can read more at the Open Source blog, and be sure to check out the website for yourself. Also, check out the below podcast that Engineering Manager at Google’s Open Source office Will Norris was featured on to talk about the new site.

The House of Representatives passed a resolution today overturning an Obama-era FCC rule that required internet providers to get customers’ permission before sharing their browsing history with other companies. The rules also required internet providers to protect that data from hackers and inform customers of any breaches. The resolution was first passed by the Senate last week and now heads to the president, who’s expected to sign it. At that point, there’ll only be a vague baseline of privacy rules governing internet providers and some promises from them not to misbehave. Got a tip for us? Use SecureDrop or Signal to securely send messages and files to The Verge without revealing your identity. It’s hard to see this as anything but a major loss for consumers. While reversing the FCC’s privacy rules will technically just maintain the status quo — internet providers have actually been able to sell your web browsing data forever (it’s just not a thing we think about all that much) — they were about to lose permission to keep doing it, unless they got explicit consent or anonymized the info. This is an increasingly important issue as Americans spend more and more time online — and keep more and more devices with them at all times. Internet providers can see what sites you visit and what apps you use, and they can see how long you’re using them for. That information is extremely revealing, and it’s easy to imagine most people would prefer to keep their reading habits private. “The consequences of passing this resolution are clear: broadband providers like AT&T, Comcast, and others will be able to sell your personal information to the highest bidder without your permission,” said Representative Anna Eshoo (D-CA) on the House floor this afternoon. “And no one will be able to protect you, not even the Federal Trade Commission that our friends on the other side of the aisle keep talking about.” So why did Congress block the rules from being implemented? Republicans bought into internet providers’ arguments that the rules discriminated against them and could confuse consumers. The rules would prevent internet providers from selling your web browsing history even though, the argument goes, websites like Google and Facebook would remain free to do the same thing. ISPs say that’s unfair and makes it hard for consumers to understand who gets to see their browsing data. Internet providers want to pretend they’re just like Google and Facebook But the argument is extremely misleading, if not outright wrong: Google and Facebook can’t see your web browsing history, they can only see what you click on while you’re on their own websites or on websites connected to their ad networks. Meanwhile, internet providers get to see a bit of nearly everything you do and visit; and even with the rules in place, they have every right to build the kind of ad-tracking websites that Google and Facebook have built. It’s just hard work, and they don’t want to do it. The rules, if anything, put internet providers on a level playing field with companies like Facebook and Google. But Republicans don’t like that it creates more work for them. “These rules do little to enhance privacy but clearly add a layer of red tape on innovators and job creators,” Representative Greg Walden (R-OR), chair of the House’s commerce committee, said ahead of the vote. The rules, he said, “have the potential to stifle one of the most innovative sectors of our economy.” This was a common line of argument from Republican representatives, who continually conflated internet providers with companies that build businesses connected to the internet. They frequently took issue with creating a distinction between these two types of companies, despite the fact the huge distinction exists: ISPs like Comcast essentially create digital roads, while companies like Google create hugely innovative businesses along those roads. There’s good reason to treat the two differently. Republicans say the privacy rules are too confusing Republicans and internet providers also complained that the FCC’s rules didn’t perfectly align with the Federal Trade Commission’s privacy framework, which governed internet providers up until the 2015 net neutrality order went into effect. In reality, the differences are slight — the real argument here is just over ISP’s ability to share your browsing history. Representative Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), chair of the House subcommittee on communications and technology, actually claimed that removing the rules would improve privacy by closing that distinction. “Consumer privacy will continue to be protected and will actually be enhanced by removing the uncertainty and confusion these rules will create,” she said. The vote was surprisingly close, coming in at 215 in favor of the resolution and 205 against; 15 Republicans even voted in opposition. With these rules all-but killed, the FCC will now be left without any firm regulations for internet providers on the books. The commission may now go about proposing and passing a weaker set of restrictions that better match up with what the FTC has on the books. This is a huge loss for consumer privacy In a statement following the vote, FCC chairman Ajit Pai indicated his approval of Congress’ action, saying the rules — which he voted against last year — represented commission “overreach” and were “designed to benefit one group of favored companies over another group of disfavored companies.” Pai reiterated his intention to realign the FCC’s rules with the FTC’s weaker privacy framework. But how that’ll happen is unclear. Pai says the FCC will work with the FTC, but he also says he’d prefer to just kill the 2015 net neutrality order so that the FCC doesn’t have a say over privacy at all. In an added blow to privacy advocates, the FCC won’t be able to pass privacy restrictions protecting all web browsing history again, since the resolution prevents it. Though the commission will, it seems, still be able to block internet providers from sharing info related to children, banking, or medical history, which the FTC considered sensitive in the first place.

For those interesting in snapping-up one of the £129 Cast-enabled devices, here’s some even better news: It’ll now play nice with tech from loads more smart home brands. From today, Google Home will work with August Smart Locks, Logitech Harmony products, the Wink Hub and Rachio Sprinklers. It’ll also enable control of LIFX smart lights, Vivint Home Security devices, Geeni Connected bulbs, cameras and power switches. Electrolux smart appliances are also compatible (via Android Central). Related: Google Home tips and tricks In our early tests of the Google Home, we found it to be capable as a voice-controlled home automation hub, but bemoaned the lack of partnerships out of the gate. Although it worked well with Philips Hue tech, Samsung SmartThings, IFTTT and Google’s own Nest and Chromecast products, third-party integration remained thin on the ground. Today’s news goes some of the way to addressing those complaints, as the Google Home squares off against the much-more-capable Amazon Echo for the right to control your smart home tech.

The technology firm also confirmed that it has reached its target early, and has set itself to train even more Africans in digital skills in the coming year. The Digital Skills programme offers 89 courses through the online portal, and Google works with 14 training partners covering more than 20 countries to offer face to face training. The programme is expected to address needs for small business owners, who are looking to better understand how to take advantage of the web across Africa. Digital tutorials Accordingly, Google will add web-focused skills training for SMEs across Africa as part of this initiative. In addition to the new target, Google is extending its commitment to the Digital Skills programme by assisting local communities further in several ways including provision of offline versions of its online training materials to reach individuals and businesses in low access areas where it is unable to hold physical training sessions. Additionally, Google would provide offline versions of the content in languages like Hausa, Swahili and IsiZulu. Speaking on the new development, Google Nigeria country manager Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor, in a press conference in Lagos last week, said that the web is a driver of economic growth, transforming society as a whole. “People must be equipped, through training and reskilling to make use of the tools, and take advantage of it for entrepreneurship, employment and e-inclusion. Our goal with this and previous web training initiatives is to enable more people across the continent better understand how to leverage the Web tools for growth – to give them access to better employment and/or the skills to start their own businesses.”   Urowayino Warami View all posts by Urowayino Warami → Previous Post Prison letter not responsible for ex-governor’s bail – Lawyer Next Post Tinubu great inspiration to African youths – Ooni Disclaimer Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.

Uber’s first report on employee diversity shows low numbers for women, especially in technology positions. Uber’s report doesn’t count drivers as employees. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Uber's first report on employee diversity shows low numbers for women, especially in technical positions. In that regard, the company is similar to other Silicon Valley giants such as Google, Facebook and Apple. But Uber's report comes as pressure mounts on the company in light of sexual harassment claims by a former employee, the antics of its embattled CEO Travis Kalanick and ongoing criticisms of a boorish "brogrammer" culture. Management defections include that of the company's president, Jeff Jones, after just six months on the job. Thirty-six percent of the company's worldwide employees are women, according to the report , which does not count drivers as employees. Google, in comparison, has 31 percent women and Apple, 32 percent. When it comes to technology jobs such as engineering, only 15 percent are women at Uber. At Google, it's 19 percent and Apple, 23 percent. As with other tech companies , Uber is making some progress in diversifying its work force. The new hires at the company show a higher percentage of women — 41 percent — as well as more underrepresented minorities. In the U.S., the largest ethnic group at Uber is white and the second largest is Asian. The report also shows that nearly 9 percent of the company's U.S. employees are black and almost 6 percent are Hispanic. At Google, a much larger company, the numbers are 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Uber also says 15 percent of its U.S. employees hold work visas, and they hail from 71 countries. Other technology companies have not been disclosing this information, but it's possible that they will follow Uber's steps — especially as the industry continues to clash heads with President Donald Trump's administration over immigration issues. Uber has about 12,000 employees worldwide, about half in the U.S. The San Francisco company has hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to lead an investigation into the sexual harassment charges leveled by the former engineer, Susan Fowler. The company plans to release the findings next month. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website  +  4  =  5 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Tom Gentile On Monday, analysts downgraded Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOGL) from a "Buy" to a "Hold" following the YouTube ad placement controversy. And with an ever-growing list of major marketing companies joining the boycott against the leader of U.S. digital ad revenue – it's no surprise that investors are worried right now. But here's the thing… Google's not the only advertising stock out there to put your money on. Quite the opposite, actually… There's another stock that's been flying under investors' radars, so to speak… It's gained 134.29% in the past 12 weeks alone. And it's one of the most undervalued advertising stocks in the game… It's Time to Put Your Money on the Digital Advertising World's "Little Guy" U.S. digital advertising is currently a $40.9 billion industry, with analysts projecting more than double the revenue – $83 billion – this year. That's why the current controversy Google is facing seems to be – on the surface – a devastating blow to the market. But as I said above, Google's not the only advertising stock out there. Rocket Fuel Inc. (Nasdaq: FUEL) is the leading provider of digital advertising solutions for digital marketing campaigns based in Redwood City, Calif. It also provides services in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. It's a fairly new company, founded in 2008, and uses real-time data and artificial intelligence to anticipate consumers' needs to improve marketing across digital media. Although it's still a "baby" in the industry, its future is very promising. In fact, just this week, the company announced its expanded partnership with IBM for the creation of a new capability, "Brand Moments," which will integrate IBM Watson Discovery technology to detect brand sentiment in online news as a means to inform consumer purchase decisions. It's AI (artificial intelligence) software accomplishes a great deal for their clients. Now the last four earnings reports have been less than stellar for FUEL – but the stock has already gained 134.29% in the last 12 weeks, with a one-year return of 28.49%. Furthermore, it's expected to grow 921.86% in revenue over the next five years. And this week, it hit its 52-week high… Above is a list of advertising companies currently at their 52-week highs, which I compiled using my proprietary tools. As you can see, FUEL holds the number one spot (notice that GOOGL isn't even on the list). It may not have that long of a tenure in the game and isn't trading as high, per share, as other advertising companies, but it's certainly on the rise and could become the leading challenger to advertising veterans. Just take a look at the stock's momentum… Thanks to its $4.20 share price, it's not quite a wallet buster – but you could also play FUEL by using long-term anticipation securities (LEAPS). You could also use a calendar spread as way to leverage your dollars. And of course, talk to your broker, Certified Public Accountant (CPA), or financial professional about the suitability for your portfolio.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Android founder’s new smartphone teased, lacks corners and bezel Android founder’s new smartphone teased, lacks corners and bezel By Ryan Whitwam on March 28, 2017 at 3:53 pm Comment Anyone who follows Android news knows Andy Rubin as the man who founded Android. His startup was acquired by Google, and Android grew into the dominant mobile platform within a few years. Rubin left Google a while back to pursue other projects, and that eventually led him to create a smartphone startup called Essential. The company has been toiling in secret since its inception, but Rubin teased its first phone the other day. If there was any doubt 2017 was the year of rounded corners, there isn’t now. We don’t know much more about this mysterious Android phone today than we did last week. In fact, we’ve only seen a tiny sliver of it. That sliver was pretty interesting, though. The screen has a rounded corner that’s snugged right up against the edge of the phone. It looks like there are only a few millimeters of bezel around the screen. This is the top of the phone, where you’d usually have an earpiece and camera. I’m not sure how the earpiece could be handled, but the front-facing camera might be at the bottom of the phone. Several devices have had very slim bezels on three sides with a larger one on the bottom. I hope that’s not what Essential is doing, though. It’s boring and not the best look. The ergonomics of a phone are also better with balanced bezels rather than uneven ones. This basic aesthetic with the rounded corners and narrow bezels is proving to be popular this year. The LG G6 has it, as does the Galaxy S8. The GS8 also adds a curved panel to further eliminate visible bezel. It’s a necessary step — people want bigger screens, but our hands aren’t getting any larger. Of course, this also makes phones a bit harder to hold without inadvertently touching the screen. Smart palm-rejection technology is a necessity. I’m really excited about how this is shaping up. Eager to get it in more people’s hands… pic.twitter.com/LRzQCFSKTm — Andy Rubin (@Arubin) March 27, 2017 Essential is coming into a crowded field that even some established smartphone makers have had trouble competing in. The company has just 40-some employees and an undisclosed cache of venture capital. Investors hope that Rubin’s experience with Android will help Essential stand out from other OEMs. Past rumors have pointed to a modular design, which would be risky. Modular phones have been tried several times, and the closest we have to success is the Moto Z. We don’t know when the mystery phone will be unveiled or how much it will cost. We just know it won’t have corners. Corners are so 2016.

How to Transfer Your Data From iOS or Android iPhone and iPad Android New iPhone? How to Transfer Your Data From iOS or Android Tim Brookes March 28, 2017 28-03-2017 6 minutes New iPhone? How to Transfer Your Data From iOS or Android Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email We carry a lot of digital baggage around with us, most of it on our smartphones. When it’s time to replace your old phone, you’ll need to migrate your contacts, pictures, and even software to the new device. Fortunately this is an easy, if time-consuming task. Moving from an old iPhone to a new iPhone is a breeze, but even moving from Android to iPhone is now considerably easier than it once was. The following advice is also applicable to the iPad and Android tablet devices. If you’re looking to switch from iOS to Android then we have a guide for that too Google Makes It Easy to Switch From iOS to Android Google Makes It Easy to Switch From iOS to Android Google just made it much easier to escape the clutches of the Apple ecosystem by switching to Android. And making it easier to switch between the two can only be a good thing for consumers. Read More . iPhone to iPhone: How It Works If you’re replacing an old Apple device with a new one, the process is painless. If you’re moving from Android, you can skip straight to the next section of this article. We’ll be using iTunes to create a backup of your existing device, which can then be copied straight to your new iPhone. By the time you’ve finished, your new phone will resemble your old phone — even if you’re opting for a larger (or smaller) model this time round. These instructions are identical whether you’re using a Mac or a Windows PC. If you are using Windows you’ll need to download and install iTunes if you haven’t already got it. 1. Back Up Your Old iPhone Simply plug your old iPhone into iTunes then click on the device icon in the top-left corner of the window. Choose the device from which you are migrating from the list. Click Backup on the Summary page that appears and follow the prompts. You may be asked whether or not you want to transfer purchases and back up your apps — both are a good idea. Make sure you have enough space to complete the backup by clicking Apple > About This Mac > Storage at the top of the screen. iTunes will tell you what size your device is, including the amount of free space you have available — simply subtract the free space from the total capacity to work out how much space you need. Lost your old phone? If you don’t have an old phone from which to backup, all may not be lost. First check whether you have any old device backups available by launching iTunes, then heading to Preferences > Devices. If you have any old iTunes backups, they will be listed here along with the date. You’ll need to decide whether or not the backup is too old to be useful to you. If you backed up to iCloud, you can choose to restore from iCloud in the next step. 2. Activate and Restore Your New iPhone Once your old device has been backed up, open up your new iPhone and connect it to your computer. Launch iTunes and you should be greeted with a welcome notice inviting you to get started with your new iPhone. When prompted, choose Restore Backup. You’ll be invited to choose a recent backup based on the device name and when the backup was created. Hit Restore and wait for your data to be transferred — it can take a while, so you might want to make a coffee or something. Note: If you are told that your device’s software is outdated, you’ll need to choose Set Up as New iPhone instead. Head to Settings > General > Software Update, update to the current new version of iOS, then erase your device again under Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Finally reconnect to iTunes and choose Restore Backup again. You can also choose Restore from iCloud Backup on the phone itself. If you haven’t got an local backups and you had iCloud backup enabled, this is your best bet (but it really can take a while). 3. Start Using Your New iPhone Once your backup has been restored your iPhone should look very familiar, though things might not be quite the way you left them. Some apps may still need to download, and you’ll need to provide login details for some accounts. This is especially true when it comes to services that use two-factor authentication, as app-specific passwords can only be used once. Got a new iphone but can't transfer my data from my old phone bc the new macbook only has type c ports zzz #firstworldproblems — Alyssa Jayne Vergara (@AlyssaJayneVee) March 19, 2017 You’re now ready to explore the new features of your device Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus No headphone port, water and dust resistance, and Apple's best camera yet -- this is the iPhone 7. Read More . Android to iPhone: You Have Options If you’re switching to iOS from an Android device then it’s also quite easy to transfer your old smartphone’s data since Apple introduced an app that automates the process. Download the Move to iOS app from Google Play on your old Android device, then transfer your data wirelessly. Note: As this process could take a while, it’s worth ensuring both devices are connected to a power source while the transfer completes. 1. Prepare Your Android Device Download and install the Move to iOS app on your old Android device, it works with all phones and tablets running Android 4.0 or later. With it you can transfer contacts, message history, photos and videos, bookmarks, email accounts, calendars, and some free applications. Launch the Move to iOS app once installed to get the process started. 2. Choose Data to Transfer Turn on your new iPhone and follow the setup procedure until you get to the “Apps and Data” screen. If you accidentally passed this point, you’ll need to reset your phone to factory settings under Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings and start again. Choose the Move Data from Android option, and hit Continue until you see a 10-digit numerical code. Enter this code on your old Android device and hit Continue. At this point your iPhone will create an ad-hoc private wireless network, which your Android device will connect to in order to copy data. Once the two devices are connected, you’ll be asked to choose which data you want to transfer. Make your selection and hit Next and the transfer will begin. 3. Start Using Your New iPhone Once the transfer is complete you can finish setting up your iOS device by logging into your Apple ID, and verifying details like email passwords. Your data should be sorted into the correct apps like Photos, Contacts, and Messages.

Also Consider Using the Cloud If you’re moving from iPhone to iPhone, there’s no reason not to transfer data using the foolproof iTunes backup method. But if you’re coming from Android or elsewhere, you may not need to transfer everything. If you’re already using the cloud for much of your computing habits, you might be content to just “start afresh.” Maybe you’re already organizing your media with Google Photos? The iOS version is free also. Most of us use a note-taking service like Evernote or OneNote Evernote vs. OneNote: Which Note-Taking App Is Right for You?

Adkins Special to the AFRO / (Courtesy Images/Logos) / March 28, 2017 0 37 tweet Google has partnered with Howard University to create Howard West, the Washington, D.C. based HBCU announced on March 23. Howard West is a summer residency program in Silicon Valley for the school’s top juniors and seniors majoring in computer science. Between 25 and 30 students will spend three months working at Google’s Mountain View campus under the tutelage of Google engineers and Howard faculty. The students receive class credit for their work while the tech giant covers students’ housing and other related expenses. The program is the first of its kind. “Howard West will continue Howard’s tradition of providing unprecedented access to opportunity, only now with a presence in the heart of Silicon Valley,” Bonita Stewart, Google’s vice president of Global Partnerships, said in a statement. Howard West is an extension of the Google in Residence program, which embeds Google engineers at Howard and other HBCUs, including Hampton University in Virginia, Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn., and Spelman College and Morehouse College in Atlanta, Ga., to teach courses. USA Today reported that some students in the program secured summer internships at Google. Last year, Google hosted 50 technical summer interns from seven HBCUs. This summer, 62 interns from 10 schools have accepted offers, the news publication reported. Howard West is part of Google’s ongoing efforts to find and retain top diverse talent. According to Google, 2 percent of their total workforce is Black and 1 percent of their technology workers are Black. Whites and Asians make up the vast majority of the company’s employees. The initiative meshes with Howard University President Wayne A.I. Frederick’s goals to plant the university’s flag on the West Coast. “We envisioned this program with bold outcomes in mind – to advance a strategy that leverages Howard’s high quality faculty and Google’s expertise, while also rallying the tech industry and other thought leaders around the importance of diversity in business and the communities they serve,” Frederick said in a statement. Although the amount of new hires the program will generate is not known, 740 students will have matriculated within five years.

CEO coach and former Google executive Kim Scott would know. After working as an executive at Google, Scott became a sought-after CEO coach in Silicon Valley, advising C-suite clients at Dropbox, Twitter and other top companies. She's helped dozens of managers through both the exciting and dreadful parts of their jobs — chief among them, firing an employee. "It goes without saying that getting fired is one of the most soul-challenging things that can happen to a person," Scott writes in her new book "Radical Candor." So, she says, leaders must be thoughtful about the decision. According to the leadership expert, here is how to know when it's time to give that employee a pink slip. First Round Kim Scott, former Google exec and CEO coach. 1. You've clearly communicated the issue with their performance on multiple occasions According to Scott, the best way to be a good boss is to be direct about an employee's performance — when it's good and when it's not. Make sure that you've communicated the problem clearly. If you have doubts about whether or not you've done so, then you probably haven't, the CEO coach says. When somebody is performing poorly, has received clear communication about the problem numerous times and still isn't improving, Scott says, then it may be time. 2. You've challenged the employee to improve on numerous occasions, and have offered to help Even if the employee has explicitly been told about the problem on multiple occasions, he or she may still be scrambling to find a solution. "Have you been humble as well as direct in your criticism," Scott writes, "offering to help her find solutions rather than attacking her as a person?" If the answer is that you have indeed offered to help — and more than once — then things are not looking good. "Getting an outside perspective can help you make sure you're being fair." -Kim Scott, author of "Radical Candor" 3. You've sought a second opinion about the employee's performance Even if you're the head of your team, don't make the decision without talking to someone you trust first, the leadership expert says. This could be the HR manager you work with or a trusted colleague. "Have you sought out a second opinion," she writes, "spoken to someone who you trust and with whom you can talk the problem through?" "Getting an outside perspective can help you make sure you're being fair." 4. You've considered the other potential reasons for poor performance There are sometimes outside reasons for weak performance. Perhaps the person is in the wrong role, has not been trained well enough or is going through a difficult time personally. Consider these possibilities carefully before you put the termination process in motion. Check out the 4-step strategy for dealing with a job you hate, from a former Google career coach show chapters Former Google career coach shares tips on what to do if you hate your job    Wednesday, 9 Nov 2016 | 9:00 AM ET | 01:39 Video by Richard Washington.

It’s worth noting that just starting a file in Excel doesn’t automatically bestow real-time co-authoring capabilities on it. Using Office’s real-time collaboration also requires keeping files in one of Microsoft’s online file storage systems. Microsoft’s support for real-time collaboration is key to keeping up with Google’s G Suite offering. Google Sheets has offered real-time collaboration for years and the Mountain View, Calif.-based tech giant has been pushing hard to attract enterprise customers who would ordinarily use Microsoft Office. When using the co-authoring features, users’ profile pictures will appear at the top of the ribbon in the Excel window. Clicking on a profile picture will let users jump to where another person is working on the spreadsheet, so it’s possible to keep tabs on what is changing. Microsoft also introduced a new AutoSave feature in beta for Word, Excel and PowerPoint on Windows, which is designed to automatically save files stored in the company's cloud storage services as users are editing them. It's supposed to cut down on that sinking feeling that comes from realizing that an Office app has crashed with unsaved data inside it. Google, Apple and other players in the productivity industry have already supported similar functionality using their cloud services.  The Excel for Windows desktop app’s real-time collaboration capabilities are only available to people who are a part of the Office Insider Program’s Fast ring, though Microsoft expects to roll out the feature to more users soon. It’s possible to work with people who don’t have a beta version of the desktop app using Excel Online, along with Excel for Android, Windows Phone and iOS, though that last one is also in beta.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Assistant and Home adds new connected device support Newsby John Callaham10 hours ago 72 2 Now that the Google Assistant digital AI is available on more Android phones, Google is also expanding its reach to include support for more connected devices. That also means those devices can be used with commands given via the Assistant-based Google Home smart speaker. See also: The complete list of services with Google Home support 1 week ago In a blog post, the company stated that Google Assistant and Home can now work with devices from Best Buy’s Insignia brand,  That means you can set it up so when you say, “OK Google, turn on the fan”, it will activate if the fan is connected to the Best Buy Insignia Wi-Fi Smart Plug. Google Assistant and Home can also work with products from companies like the smart multicolored lights sold by LIFX, along with the connected lights and smart plugs that are available from TP-Link. Finally, you can make voice commands that will work with products from Wink, including its lights and its smart hubs, which can help control a number of other connected devices like thermostats and others. Google Home, along with the Google Wi-Fi mesh routers, will soon expand beyond the US. The company confirmed earlier today that both products will be sold in the UK starting on April 6, and both will be priced starting at £129.

The hands-free assistant and speaker, similar to its rival Amazon Echo, was launched last year in the U.S. in an attempt to make artificial intelligence readily available in homes. Google's new product, Google Wifi, would be released simultaneously, as well.  The U.K. can look forward to new features not yet released elsewhere. “We know the U.K. has been patiently waiting for Google Home to arrive and we’ve been working with our favorite partners to give you the best possible experience,” director of Product Partnerships and Planning at Google, Suveer Kothari said in the blog post. “We’ve hidden a few British treats for you to discover; just try asking Google Home about its hobbies or favorite foods.”  Google Home, powered by Google’s search engine, knows how to use maps, ask questions, make calendar entries and translate. It can also deliver news briefs from BBC, the Financial Times, the Sun, the Guardian, Huffington Post, Sky News, Sky Sports and more. By using the Google assistant, the device can also answer questions based off “interests, the weather, traffic, sports, finance, local businesses and more.” Additionally, customers can play music via voice command from Google Play Music, Spotify, TuneIn and live radio from BBC. Kothari said Google would be introducing its own Wifi service to combat disruptive wireless connections, which would replace a traditional router and allow users to have uninterrupted wifi service in all parts of a house. Google Wifi uses a mesh network that connects individual Wifi points together that finds “the best path for your data.” The product comes with an app that would allow its customers to pause Wifi on other devices, similar to parent control options. Google Wifi’s one pack was scheduled to be available online for £129, and a two pack would be available from the Google Store for £2,299. Customers will find both products at Dixons, Argos, John Lewis, Maplin—with Google Home priced at £129. Google Home, pictured above during the presentation of new Google Hardware in San Francisco, California on Oct. 4, 2016, was scheduled to release in the U.K. on April 6.

The measure passed by 215 votes to 205. This follows the same vote in the Senate last week. Just prior to the vote, a White House spokesman said the president supported the bill, meaning that the decision will soon become law. This approval means that whoever you pay to provide you with internet access – Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable, etc – will be able to sell everything they know about your use of the internet to third parties without requiring your approval and without even informing you. Your ISP already knows quite a lot about you: your name and address, quite possibly your age, and a host of other personally identifiable information such as your social security number. That's on the customer information side. On the service side, they know which websites you visit, when, and how often. That information can be used to build a very detailed picture of who you are: what your political and sexual leanings are; whether you have kids; when you are at home; whether you have any medical conditions; and so on – a thousand different data points that, if they have sufficient value to companies willing to pay for them, will soon be traded without your knowledge. As one high-profile venture capitalist recently discovered, your previous search history can also impact what result you see in future. Although in his case, he probably wishes he hadn't publicly criticized Apple on Twitter for giving him the details of a porn actress at the top of his search results. The precise user profiles that can be built using this data are worth their weight in gold to advertisers, and explains why Google and Facebook are two of the world's largest companies despite only being a search facility and an online noticeboard. In fact, thanks to a quirk that resulted from efforts to make such selling of personal information illegal, we know how much that information is worth to your ISP: $30 per household per month. That jumps to $60 per month if you get internet access through your cable provider – which most Americans do – because it also enables the company to monitor your TV usage and connect the two. With over 100 million households online in the United States, that means Congress has just given Big Cable an annual payday of between $35bn and $70bn. Impact It is difficult to underestimate the impact that the shift away from data privacy to open season on personal information sales may have. With cable companies now given strong financial incentive to draw on user information and habits, and with the stick of regulatory intervention effectively thrown away, it may result in significant societal changes. The irony is that just a few months ago the situation was the polar opposite. When US comms watchdog the FCC controversially declared that broadband providers were "common carriers" along the same lines as telephone companies, one of the many impacts was that it pulled enforcement of data privacy rules away from US trade watchdog the FTC and gave it to the FCC (which has very limited experience in consumer issues). As a result of that, the FCC passed new privacy rules that are a little stronger than FTC rules, mostly in that they are preemptive and that they require ISPs to give customers an opt-in option for their most sensitive information – in other words, they have to actively get your permission before selling that data. This opt-in issue is what exposed the value of such data to ISPs: when Google launched its Fiber Gigabit offering in various cities for just $70 a month, AT&T responded by offering pretty much the same service at the same price point – but to get that price you had to agree to be a part of its "Internet Preferences" program, which gave it permission to examine your web traffic and sell it on. Take that "service" off and the price jumped $29 per month. If you also had TV or phone service, the price jumped $60 per month. Meanwhile, back at the FCC, thanks to presidential politics and the election of Donald Trump, two commissioners – both Democrats – left. That meant the two Republican commissioners held a majority. The new chair, Ajit Pai, killed off the new FCC privacy rules literally days before they were due to take effect, leaving a situation where ISPs are no longer under FTC jurisdiction and there are no FCC rules for them to adhere to. On top of that, Congressional use of what was an obscure piece of legislation until two months ago – the Congressional Review Act – effectively introduces a permanent ban on the FCC rules. Privacy rules that are "substantially similar" cannot be reintroduced without the approval of Congress now that the "congressional disapproval" vote has passed. So, unless the FCC or Congress scrap the net neutrality rules that pulled ISPs under the FCC's jurisdiction – something which, if it does happen, is going to take some time – the result of the vote, for ISPs, is that they have an open field to sell their customers' data. Critically, however, the situation looks set to stay unchanged for several years, and that gives ISPs an incentive to build new systems that provide maximum financial return on selling customer data. In short, the constraints are off. What are we looking at in reality? So, setting aside hyperbole or extrapolation, what does this actually mean for end users? What can ISPs really see? And what can they really sell? Well, at the moment, it gives them the right to effectively sell ads like Facebook and Google. Both these companies build up a huge amount of information on individual users and then sell them. They sell the data in aggregate and keep a tight control on the fine details. That means that a company selling, say, a new electric car, will be able to pay Facebook to put its ads in front of you based on its own criteria: we are targeting families with parents aged between 30 and 45 who live in the San Francisco Bay Area. Facebook knows who you are because you are permanently logged into Facebook, and not only do you post a lot of information there but you also use your Facebook login to get into other sites. Facebook pulls all this information together, figures out who you are, and then sends you ads that are included in its massive pool of ads. Google does the same thing in a different way: it uses your search results, it may use the Chrome browser, and it uses its various services – Gmail being the big one – to build up a profile of who you are. You are probably always logged into Gmail, and you have Chrome as your default browser – so everything you do potentially finds its way back to Google and they aggregate and sell it. ISPs now have this power too. Except they have one huge advantage: they don't have to get you to log or opt into anything. If you log out of Gmail, and you switch your search engine to something that is not Google, then Google effectively goes blind. Likewise, if you log out of Facebook (and any sites you used Facebook to log into) and delete all the cookies it has installed on your system, it also goes blind. Not so your ISP – your ISP sees everything you are doing because its service is your very internet connection. Even if you use the "incognito" mode that many browsers offer where you can't be tracked by cookies, your ISP can still see where you are going because it has to go get the information from the websites you are looking at. Content Now, the really big question is: can your ISPs see the content of your online interactions? Can it read your emails? Can it read your search results? Can it store and search through the words you typed into a webpage? And the answer is: yes, sometimes. If the website you visit is not secured with HTTPS – meaning that any data between you and the website is encrypted – then your ISP can see exactly what you are doing. Now, this scary reality is tempered by two things: first, a majority of websites these days, especially big ones, use HTTPS. And second, it is a lot of hassle for ISPs to take this enormous quantity of information and make something valuable out of it. In short, it is not worth the cost of searching through your (and millions of others') web traffic to find information that they can sell. What they make from that will not cover the costs of searching. But that may change with this Congressional vote: the economics may shift in favor of searching that traffic. It is a certainty that ISPs will run experiments to see if they can make money from digging into this information. Pharmaceutical companies in particular pay a lot of money for information on users looking for specific drugs, because they can potentially make thousands of dollars from getting people using their particular drug. Again, ISPs have always been able to do this, however with this congressional vote, they don't have to fear the FTC landing them with a multi-million-dollar fine. They don't have to disclose to anyone that they are doing this. And they don't have to fret that the hands-on FCC will come after them either. It is a free-for-all with potentially billions of dollars there for the taking. What to do So, the logical question is: what can you do about it? Well, we'll leave aside contacting your Congressional representative to complain, because the vote's already gone through and there's not much that's going to change that reality right now. And we'll leave aside the Congressional elections in two years that could change Washington dynamics back in favor of user privacy. What can you do today, right now, on your computer to limit what other companies can do with your data? We have five general suggestions: Use Tor or a VPN If you connect to the Tor anonymizing system, or use Tor's browser, your ISP will only know that you have connected to Tor; from there it loses the data trail. Of course the downside to this is that your browsing will be slower. Be aware, your unencrypted traffic to websites outside the Tor network passes through a complete stranger's exit node: the person running the exit node can watch what you're doing. All you've done is move from your ISP snooping on you to an exit node admin watching you. On the other hand, you'll cycle through different exit nodes, so it's harder to be identified and tracked by websites outside the Tor network. A virtual private network is an alternative that will work for lots of people, especially if your work has a VPN service that you can use for free. This again will cut off your ISP's ability to see what you are doing. But – and this is a big but – do some research on your VPN provider. Do NOT use a free VPN provider because they face even stronger financial temptations to sell your information. If you use a VPN, you are effectively giving that company the same level of insight into your online life as your ISP. So pay for one, and check out their policies on what they do with the data they build on you. In short, unless you have a work VPN service you can use, you are going to have to pay to hide your data from your ISP effectively. If you can set up a VPN server yourself, do so, or use a tool to do it for you. Be aware, some websites – such as Netflix – clamp down on VPN use, so you won't be able to use every site with one. Use a different search engine Google offers a wonderful service, but everything you type in its search box is logged and connected to you in as many ways as possible. It is then sold on. So why not use a different search engine? Rather than simply type into Chrome's internet address bar, or using the search box in Firefox, why not stick a shortcut on your browser's top bar to a search engine like DuckDuckGo, which will not track you or store your information? It is one step more than, say, using Google but it is easy to make it a habit, and you would be protecting your personal data. Log out and/or use two browsers at the same time You don't have to be logged into Facebook and/or Gmail all the time, you really don't. So why not log out when you're done with them? In fact, as studies have shown repeatedly, if you can keep the distractions away – oh, look, someone 'liked' my post; there's another email from my co-worker, I wonder what it's about – then you can not only be much more effective and efficient but you also feel less overwhelmed and more at peace. Try it. If you do insist on being logged into Facebook/Gmail all the time, why not use one browser – say, Chrome – for that and another – say, Firefox – for all your browsing? It is easy to switch between browsers on your computer, and using two will limit what third parties can see about what you are doing. Again, it's a habit thing: hard to do at first; automatic shortly after. Use HTTPS If the website you are visiting has HTTPS, your ISP can see you have visited it – and how long you spent there – but it cannot see beyond there, including any particular pages you may have visited or any searches or other data you typed in. The HTTPS Everywhere browser plugin will enable that same kind of encryption to be applied to websites without the extra security. It's not perfect but it's a good way to cut down on data leakage. Call your ISP and ask them about opting out Seemingly an obvious thing to do, but one that hardly anyone bothers doing: call your ISP. Tell them you are concerned about them tracking your activity and ask them for their policies. Ask them what information they have on you. Ask them what they are allowed to sell. Ask them what you are allowed to opt out of (they are obliged to tell you), and then opt out of it. Basically, make it clear you aren't happy with them being able to sell your data. Companies are still companies: they don't want unhappy customers. If this becomes a big thing for companies, if they fear losing your business, then at the same time they develop new systems to make the most from this Congressional loosening up of data privacy rules, they will look at allowing customers to opt out. The number of customers who complain will probably have a direct impact on how much the additional privacy would end up costing.

Google Search App for iOS gains Gboard, trending widget & 3D Touch An update to the iOS Google Search app gives you more features and bug fixes. Barry Schwartz on March 28, 2017 at 12:26 pm More Google announced that the Google Search app for iOS devices has added GBoard, trending widgets and new 3D Touch functionality. Gboard Gboard, the popular Google search keyboard, which Google enabled for iOS as an add-on keyboard back in May 2016, is now available directly within the Google app. Launch the Google search app on your iPhone or iPad to try it out. To access this keyboard, go to your Google app settings to set up Gboard on your device. Gboard is a really excellent alternative to the iOS default keyboard that lets you type normally but also search for emojis, GIFs, search results and much more, directly in your keyboard. Trends A new iOS dashboard widget is now available for those who installed the Google Search App. It is named “Trending on Google,” and it will show you the current Google Trends when you swipe right on your home screen. To access the widget, use 3D Touch on the app icon or swipe right on your home screen. To install it, swipe right on your home screen, scroll to the bottom, tap “Edit,” then add “Trending on Google.” 3D Touch Not only can you hard-press, aka 3D Touch, to access Google Trends, you can also hard-press on a web page within the app or search results to find out more. Press on the “G” button at the bottom of the page to instantly start a new search. Or you can hard-press on Search results, Map results and cards in your feed to see a preview of the content before opening it all the way. You can try these features out using the iOS Google app. About The Author Barry Schwartz Barry Schwartz is Search Engine Land's News Editor and owns RustyBrick, a NY based web consulting firm.

AdWords Dynamic Search Ads gain page feeds, will soon support expanded text ads Page feeds are designed to give advertisers more control over which URLs to associate with a DSA campaign. Ginny Marvin on March 28, 2017 at 10:54 am More Google announced updates to AdWords Dynamic Search Ads on Tuesday, including support for expanded text ads. Dynamic Search Ads (DSAs) will transition to expanded text ads through April, bringing them in line with search and display campaigns. Google is introducing a new solution for DSAs called page feeds. Page feeds consist of two columns: Page URL and Custom Label. The feeds enable advertisers to designate exactly which landing pages to include in a DSA campaign. There are several benefits and use cases for page feeds, such as these: If advertisers only want DSAs to trigger for certain landing pages, advertisers can select “Use URLs from my page feed only” in campaign settings. To get new products promoted quickly in addition to other products, advertisers can include the product page URLs in a page feed and select the option to “Use URLs from both Google’s index of my website and my page feed” in campaign settings. Custom labels in page feeds can be used to group products around promotions, stock availability, star ratings and more. You can add several custom labels, using a semicolon to separate them in the feed. The page feed data template is available here. See the help page for more information on page feeds for DSAs. After uploading a page feed to the Business Data section of the Shared Library in AdWords, add it to the relevant DSA campaign in settings. Custom labels are applied from the Auto targets tab. Click to add a new Dynamic ad target and enter the custom label. Bid modifiers can be applied to custom labels. Google also says it has continued to make quality updates for DSAs, such as taking location signals into account, and that the latest changes have led to better conversion rates and lower CPAs, on average.

Vivint is the first smart home services provider to integrate with Google’s voice-enabled speaker, giving consumers an easy way to control their home using their voice. Vivint customers can simply say “Ok Google” to control multiple smart home products throughout their home, including their smart locks, lights, cameras, garage doors, thermostats and security system. For example, just saying “Ok Google, tell Vivint I’m hot,” can turn down the thermostat. Thanks to Google Home’s far-field voice recognition and the Google Assistant's industry-leading natural language processing, it understands customers’ commands, even from across the room. Beginning in April, Vivint customers will be able to connect Google Home to their Vivint smart home system using the Google Home app. They can then talk to the device to control their home, in addition to using the Vivint SkyControl panel or Vivint Smart Home app. “This integration with the Google Assistant on Google Home further extends our leadership in bringing voice control to the smart home,” said Jeremy Warren, chief technology officer at Vivint Smart Home. “We’ve been blown away by the response to voice, but a growing number of consumers have been clamoring to bring this experience to Google Home. We’re excited about the future of this product and how it will enhance the smart home experience for millions of consumers around the world.” A recent survey by Coldwell Banker Real Estate LLC and Vivint Smart Home found that Americans are ready to embrace voice control in the home. According to the survey, 72 percent of Americans who have smart home products want voice control. To learn more about Vivint and Google Home, visit www.vivint.com/googlehome.

According to the post that went up on Google's Security Blog, the company outlines that since 2012, it has warned users when their accounts were suspected of state-sponsored attacks. A year ago, in an effort to make these things even clearer for the user, the firm changed how notifications were delivered, doing away with a small warning banner that could have gone unnoticed. While a majority of users will never see such a warning, Google is again putting the spotlight on these types of attacks, but also explains: The notice does not necessarily mean that the account has been compromised or that there is a widespread attack. Rather, the notice reflects our assessment that a government-backed attacker has likely attempted to access the user’s account or computer through phishing or malware. Naturally, Google urges users to get a Security Checkup to make sure that everything is secure and to also enable two-factor authentication, which a lot of its services support.

With the new feature, developers noticed a huge increase in the number of apps being downloaded and it also helped them in maintaining a lift after the free period.

Digital Trends Home > Home > Google Home now takes voice commands for… Google Home now takes voice commands for Wink-controlled lighting and heating By Bruce Brown — March 28, 2017 9:00 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Now there are even more devices you can control with Google Home. Another smart home product family has joined the Google Home parade. As of March 28, 2017, the Wink lineup is ready to take its switching, dimming, and temperature control orders from the Google Home’s Google Voice assistant. You could already use voice commands to control Wink-linked products with a skill for Alexa, the Amazon Echo voice assistant available. Now, Google Home users can get in on the action as well. More: Secure your home with your smart hub thanks to the new Wink and August partnership The first step is to hook up your Wink hub to lights, outlets and thermostats with Google Home. Be sure you have the Google Home app on your iOS or Android device. Open the Google Home app and tap the menu button in the upper left corner of the main page. Next, tap “Home Control” and then tap the “+” button in the lower right corner. Select “Wink” and enter the email and password you use with your Wink account. At this point, you’re ready to go. Using Google Voice to control your Wink-associated smart home devices is about as simple as it could be. Using the names you assigned to various Wink controllers or switches, just remember to start each voice command with, “OK, Google.” For example, if you have a configured Wink controller for your living room lights and you want to turn them on, just say, “OK, Google, turn living room light on.” If you want the light a bit dimmer, say, “OK Google, set living room light to 80 percent.” Using Google Voice to control your thermostat also works with simple instructions. You can declare a specific temperature or request a change by a number of degrees. For example, just say “OK, Google, set the bedroom thermostat to 68 degrees” and the command is sent. If it’s not warm enough, just say “OK, Google, turn up the bedroom temperature by 2 degrees.” Greater interconnectivity and control for your smart home devices increases their functional convenience. With support for both Amazon Echo’s Alexa and Google Home’ Google Voice, Wink’s hubs and controllers just gained more flexibility.

The Google powered video streaming platform has rolled the new mobile live streaming feature to creators with more than 10,000 subscribers. Creators who have a subscriber base less than 10k will also get the feature soon. The live streaming feature is built right into the YouTube mobile app. To start streaming a video, users just need to open the YouTube app, hit the capture button to start recording the video that will go live for their subscriber base. Google blog mentioned that the streamed videos will have all the same features as regular YouTube videos. As noted, the live streaming of video through computers was first available in the year 2011. Photo Credit: Giphy Besides, to help creators earn revenue from live streaming, the video streaming platform has also launched Super Chat, a live stream monetization tool available to creators in more than 20 countries and viewers in more than 40 countries. SEE ALSO: Bored of YouTube? Here are a few alternative video streaming sites Google says that Super Chat lets any fan watching a live stream stand out from the crowd and get a creator's attention by purchasing chat messages that are highlighted in bright colors and stay pinned to the top of the chat window for up to five hours. It's a pretty neat idea that will give viewers a chance to add a little visual flair to their chats and at the same time will allow creators to keep connected to their fans while earning a little money. It is worth mentioning that Google has slowed down live chat during the video stream on the YouTube Mobile app as receiving 2,000 messages per second is little too fast. Besides, Google blog also mentions that the team has worked on improving streaming quality across a wider range of devices. YouTube's Mobile Live streaming app will compete with the Facebook's popular live feature that allows users to stream live videos on their time-line. Whereas the Super chat feature is Google's take on Twitter's Periscope.

Judge criticizes Uber’s secrecy in lawsuit with Waymo Posted 12 hours ago by Kate Conger (@kateconger) 0 SHARES Next Story Twitch to start selling video games this week Google’s side of the story in its patent and trade secret case against Uber is pretty damning — Google alleges that a former employee of its self-driving car unit, Anthony Levandowski, stole thousands of sensitive documents on his way out the door to lead Uber’s self-driving efforts. But, as an attorney for Uber told reporters last week, Uber would very much like all of this to be resolved in arbitration between Google’s Waymo and Levandowski rather than in open court. That desire for secrecy is on full display in a new, heavily redacted motion Uber filed in the case today, asking for the dispute to be forced into arbitration based on the employment contract Levandowski signed with Google. Arbitration would have several benefits for Uber — it would distance the company from the allegations of theft leveraged against Levandowski, and it would keep the proceedings out of the public eye. “Waymo especially should not be allowed to avoid arbitration where it has alleged pervasive collusion between Levandowski and Defendants, and where its claims are connected with, and founded on, Levandowski’s alleged misconduct while he was a Waymo employee — conduct that his employment contracts governed,” Uber argued. “Waymo’s purpose for proceeding in this curious manner seems clear: through artful pleading, it hopes to avoid arbitrating the misappropriation and UCL [unfair competition law] claims at all costs.” Waymo claims that, regardless of Levandowski’s employment contract, Uber is still infringing on its patents and so the case needs to move forward. Judge William Alsup, who is presiding over the case, slammed Uber’s heavy redactions and told both companies to sort out what actually needs to be kept secret from Levandowski’s employment contract.  Related Articles Google's fight with Uber over self-driving cars is heating up Waymo files for an injunction against Uber's use of its self-driving tech Waymo sues Uber and Otto for theft of trade secrets Google's self-driving car unit becomes Waymo “Our federal courts belong to the public, and the public and the press have a legitimate interest in looking over our shoulders to see the work in progress in our courts. The essence of our work concerns evaluating competing arguments. Parties should not hide those arguments under seal out of a desire to shroud business dealings in secrecy,” he wrote. The two companies are due back in court on May 3 to debate a preliminary injunction that would prevent Uber from using Waymo technology while the lawsuit is underway. Judge Alsup has asked Uber and Waymo to come up with code names for Waymo’s trade secrets so that they can be referenced during the public hearing. Update, 2 p.m. PT: Uber said in a new filing that the redactions are all Google’s fault and that it wanted to file an unredacted brief in the first place. “Uber applied the redactions based on Google’s insistence that the existence of an arbitration and every word in its employment agreements must be kept in strictest confidence – we are trying to confer with them further on that issue now,” an attorney for Uber wrote.

  Skip to content Home News The Flare Features Opinion Sports Pathways Advertising Staff Contact Us Websclusives ChampiOnion Opinion Cyber bullies Cyber bullies Sydney Jones March 28, 2017 March 28, 2017Opinion Russian agents identified in U.S. hacks ESPIONAGE — Five hundred email accounts on Yahoo and Google servers were hacked. Google Image In the year 2014, the Sochi Olympics took place, Robin Williams died and the Ebola virus terrorized the world. It was also the year in which Russian hackers were responsible for one of the largest data breaches in history. Two Russian FSB agents and two criminal hackers broke into Yahoo and Google servers and used their unauthorized access to gain entrance into 500 million email accounts, which included Russian journalists, government officials from several countries and employees from top businesses, according to the Washington Post. The information obtained in the hacks was used to discover trade and economic secrets. The data was also used by the hackers for personal financial gain by searching the content for credit card numbers and creating a spam campaign. On March 15, 2017,  a California grand jury indicted the four defendants, two Russian intelligence agents and two that were hired by Russia, seeking to make an example to future hackers that America will no longer turn a blind eye to blatant cyber attacks directed toward American citizens. “Today we continue to pierce the veil of anonymity surrounding cyber crimes,” FBI Director James Comey said in a U.S. Department of Justice press release. “We are shrinking the world to ensure that cyber criminals think twice before targeting U.S. persons and interests.” Cyber espionage and online war is increasing and becoming more prevalent and malicious. According to the 2015 Cyberthreat Defense Report, 71 percent of Americans were affected by a successful cyber attack. This is evidence that America as a nation should strive to become more aware of the potential threats to our cyberspace and actively defend against these efforts. Technology has advanced rapidly in recent years, but it seems American cyber security has not. This has not only hurt the government but also American companies as well. The Yahoo and Google hacks are one example of this. “The U.S. government is three to five years behind the commercial market when it comes to building security in,” Gary McGraw said in an interview with UVA Today. McGraw, vice president of security technology at Synopsys, said that while America’s online presence is vast, many companies are not building security into their infrastructure, but rather waiting until it is needed and by that time it is too late. This is not the first major hack to happen to Yahoo. In 2013, more than 1 billion accounts were compromised. I believe these attacks will continue to happen if our government and businesses do not put more effort into safeguarding the websites we visit. “Cyberspace is particularly difficult to secure due to a number of factors: the ability of malicious actors to operate from anywhere in the world, the linkages between cyberspace and physical systems, and the difficulty of reducing vulnerabilities and consequences in complex cyber networks,” a Sept. 27, 2016 statement on the Department of Homeland Security website said. The Yahoo hacks were a painful reminder that America has a long way to go when it comes to the field of cyber security. But this can also serve as a cautionary tale to the average person to do their best to safeguard against account hacking. Having a unique password for each website account, avoiding traveling to suspicious or unsafe websites and keeping up-to-date on firewall protection are all listed on DHS website as ways to avoid hacking.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Truecaller adds Google Duo video calling support Software Truecaller adds Google Duo video calling support By Sohil Nikam - Mar 28, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Truecaller has announced some big changes for version 8 of its app at an event in New Delhi, outlining some major India-specific features at the occasion. Interestingly, the company has tied up with Google to add Duo integration for video calling. Google Duo hasn’t joined hands with any other service as a third-party add-on till date. The partnership should be an interesting one, allowing Truecaller to boast of video calling support within its app and Google to widen its user base. The melding of the two will be rolled out over the course of the next couple of months for Android and iOS. It should be noted that Google Duo integration will arrive as a permission-based service, meaning people can opt in or out any time. Other than venturing into the world of video chats, Truecaller is also expanding into the payment sector in India by collaborating with ICICI Bank. Also See: Truecaller for Android gets Call Me Back feature Truecaller Pay will be powered by the brand’s Mobile Identity Platform and operate as a peer-to-peer payment solution to transfer money via phone numbers. Individuals will be able to create their Virtual Payment Address (VPA) in the application and then proceed to conduct transactions with any Unified Payments Interface (UPI) supported bank. Another India-only feature is a subscription-based service called Airtel Truecaller ID. The tool is meant for feature phone Airtel users who want to filter out spam calls without using up data. It’s supposed to send a flash SMS containing an unknown number’s identity before a call hits a person’s phone. Truecaller 8 will further bring with it smart SMS skills to automatically identify unknown messages and block spam right inside the main app rather than relegating them to Truemessenger. There’s also a new flash messaging feature which lets people quickly send pre-defined texts or emoji to contacts when they’re in a hurry or in distress. You can download Truecaller via the App Store or Play Store.

However, they have yet to spell out clearly whether the government wants them to weaken encrypted services such as WhatsApp or are simply asking for ways to gain access to phones in their possession to recover suspects' communications. British media have reported that shortly before launching the attack last Wednesday, Khalid Masood used encrypted messaging via WhatsApp which investigators cannot read. Police have been trying to determine whether Masood - who killed four people including a policeman near parliament in London before being shot dead - acted alone. Neil Basu, a top counter-terrorism policeman, said his communications on the day of the attack are the main line of inquiry and said he had a clear interest in jihadist armed struggle. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday she wanted tech firms such as Facebook, Apple and Google to find ways to give security services access to messages on phones, but was leaving it up to companies to sort out how. British officials plan to meet US tech executives on Thursday to insist they do more to crack down on extremist content on websites such as Google's YouTube, following a revolt over the issue by major advertisers, including British government agencies. They also plan to press Silicon Valley leaders to help monitor communications by potential attackers. "If there are circumstances where law enforcement agencies need to be able to access the contents, they should be able to do so. How that is achieved, I think, is a matter for the talks later in the week," May's spokesman said. The criticisms are the latest moves by European countries to rein in US tech giants, pressing them do more to stop hate speech and extremist activities online. Germany is planning a new law calling for social networks like Facebook and Twitter to remove hate speech quickly or face fines of up to EUR 50 million ($54 million). Politics, or something new? The government has so far stopped short of seeking fresh laws that would make tech firms create back doors to privacy protections enabled by encryption. Instead, the Investigatory Powers Act, which came into force in November, forced tech firms to help law enforcement agencies bypass encryption, when possible, and keep records of sites their customers visit, updating decades-old surveillance laws. On Sunday Home Secretary (interior minister) Amber Rudd called for the tech companies to give security services access to encrypted messaging systems, then later qualified her stronger statements, saying she supported user privacy. "We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp - and there are plenty of others like that - don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other," Rudd first told BBC TV. Later, when speaking to Sky News, she appeared to pull back on calling on tech firms to undermine encryption protections and focused instead on demanding lawful access to phones. "You can have a system whereby they can build it so we can have access to it when it is absolutely necessary," Rudd said. "But I want to draw a very clear distinction here - I support end-to-end encryption as part of cyber security, for families, for banking, for businesses," she said. A Home Office spokeswoman reinforced Rudd's comments on Monday, saying it is "irresponsible to give terrorists a way to plot online which cannot be intercepted by the police". A spokeswoman for WhatsApp, a unit of Silicon Valley social media giant Facebook, said the company was horrified by the attack and cooperating with law enforcement agencies in their inquiries. WhatsApp introduced end-to-end encryptions by default a year ago this month for its 1.2 billion users worldwide, joining other services such as Signal and Apple's iMessage. Facebook is likely to comply with a subpoena for data on what numbers Masood called, and when, using WhatsApp, based on how it has responded in prior cases. Alternately, police may demand help in unlocking his phone, which raises thornier issues, depending on what device he was using. Britain could also press Facebook and other Internet services to provide a way to monitor or record encrypted conversations - akin to wiretapping traditional voice calls - which would move the debate into uncharted legal territory. One former top British military official said forcing tech companies to weaken encryption would simply make the problem mutate and lead extremists to find other ways to communicate. "There is a lot of politics at play here," Major General Jonathan Shaw, who was in charge of cyber security at the Ministry of Defence, told BBC Radio 4 on Monday. "What they (the government) are trying to do is use this moment to nudge the debate more in their line," said Shaw, who retired from the army in 2012 as assistant chief of the defence staff. © Thomson Reuters 2017 Tags: UK, WhatsApp, WhatsApp Encryption, End to End Encryption, Privacy, Facebook, Apps, Internet, Social Waze Gets Into the Order-Ahead Business With Dunkin' Donuts Britain Reopens Privacy Debate After Attack, Presses Tech Firms     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Itel Wish A41 Panasonic Eluga Ray X Panasonic Eluga Ray Max Datawind MoreGMax 3G6 Intex Aqua 4G Mini Micromax Spark Vdeo Zen Admire Swadesh Oppo F3 Plus Panasonic Eluga Pure Lava Z25 Lava Z10 ZTE Nubia N2 ZTE Nubia M2 Lite ZTE Nubia M2 Apple iPad (2017) Wi-Fi + Cellular Apple iPad (2017) Wi-Fi Karbonn Aura Note 4G Karbonn Aura Sleek 4G Sony Xperia L1 Huawei P10 Lite Popular Xiaomi Redmi 4A Moto G5 Plus Samsung Galaxy S8 Moto M Oppo A57 Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Nokia 6 OnePlus 3T Lava Z25 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones Nokia Phones Gadgets 360 Hindi सैमसंग गैलेक्सी एस8 आज होगा लॉन्च, ऐसे देखें लाइव स्ट्रीम माइक्रोमैक्स डुअल 5 आज होगा भारत में लॉन्च असूस ज़ेनबुक यूएक्स अल्ट्रा-पोर्टेबल लैपटॉप लॉन्च, कीमत 76,990 रुपये Latest Videos 02:34 360 Daily: Truecaller Gets New Features, Moto G5, Sony Xperia XZs India Launch Dates, and More 03:16 [Sponsored] OPPO F3 Plus: The Selfie-Expert with a Big Battery 02:12 Panasonic Eluga Ray Max, Eluga Ray X First Look 20:15 But First, Let Me Take a Selfie 01:18 How to Click the Perfect Selfie More Videos» OPINIONS ALL AUTHORS Gopal Sathe Iron Fist Is a Lot More Fun Than Most Critics Would Have You Believe Akhil Arora Samsung Pay Is Here, and It Could Be the Best Reason to Get the Galaxy S8 Kunal Dua Nokia 3310: What's in a Name?

Related Articles Biz Break: Oh, Snap! Messaging app company gets high marks from Wall Street Self-driving Ubers back in action in SF following Arizona crash “Riding up Front” art group features immigration stories of Uber, Lyft drivers Uber’s self-driving cars off the road following Arizona crash The newest battleground between public transit and Uber, Lyft is an unlikely one That means women are less likely to have a tech-related job at Uber than they are at Airbnb, Google or Facebook. And Uber’s leaders are overwhelmingly male — with men making up 78 percent of the company’s leadership team. While Uber is far from the only Silicon Valley tech company lacking in gender diversity, the ride-hailing company is under particular scrutiny after a series of complaints over the way its managers treat women. “​This report is a first step in showing that diversity and inclusion is a priority at Uber,” CEO Travis Kalanick wrote in a statement. “I know that we have been too slow in publishing our numbers — and that the best way to demonstrate our commitment to change is through transparency. And to make progress, it’s important we measure what matters.” Among the companies that scored better than Uber with regard to women in tech-related jobs, Airbnb last reported employing women in 26 percent of its tech roles, Google reported 19 percent and Facebook,17 percent. Twitter is on par with Uber, also reporting 15 percent. After long refusing to reveal Uber’s diversity numbers, even as other Silicon Valley tech companies began publishing regular reports, Kalanick in February promised to release his company’s data. Chief Human Resources Officer Liane Hornsey reiterated that vow last week during a conference call, joining two of Uber’s other female leaders in an attempt to reassure the public that the company was on track to making changes in its workplace culture. Freada Kapor Klein, diversity advocate and co-chair of the Oakland-based Kapor Center for Social Impact, said Uber’s numbers in technical jobs “aren’t great.” But no one else is getting it right, either. “It’s interesting to me that companies who have been spending hundreds of millions of dollars to improve diversity, and hiring (diversity and inclusion) staff, are honestly not doing much better than Uber,” she wrote in an emailed statement. As is the case with many tech companies, Uber has more women in its non-technical roles. The company says globally women make up 36 percent of its overall workforce. That compares to 43 percent at Airbnb, 37 percent at Twitter, 33 percent at Facebook and 31 percent at Google. Uber scores better than some of its peers in terms of racial diversity. Almost 9 percent of the ride-hailing company’s U.S. employees are African-American, compared to nearly 3 percent at Airbnb, 3 percent at Twitter, and 2 percent at Google and Facebook. Uber says 31 percent of its employees are Asian and almost 6 percent are Hispanic. The numbers Uber released Tuesday don’t take the company’s drivers into account. Not to be outdone, Lyft on Tuesday said it will release a diversity report of its own in the near future. To date the smaller ride-hailing company has not published an extensive overview of its employee diversity. “Inclusion and diversity in our communities makes everyone stronger,” Tariq Meyers, Lyft’s head of diversity and inclusion, wrote in an emailed statement. Uber on Tuesday also laid out steps it is taking to improve its numbers. The company said it will contribute $3 million over three years to organizations that bring underrepresented groups into tech. The specific organizations have yet to be determined, and Uber says it will choose them after listening to employee feedback. While Hornsey in a blog post acknowledged that Uber’s diversity metrics need to be better, she highlighted improvements the company already has made. Last year 41 percent of Uber’s new employees were women — 5 percent more than the proportion of women in the startup’s overall workforce. Uber also is ramping up its recruiting and outreach at historically African-American colleges and institutions that serve the Hispanic population, she wrote. Uber’s diversity report comes after Kalanick met with civil rights leader Jesse Jackson last week in Chicago to talk about inclusion. Jackson and his organization, the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, have been trying to get Uber to publish a diversity report for more than a year — the civil rights leader first asked in September 2015, then followed up with a second letter in January of this year. Uber says pressure to release its numbers also had been building internally among company employees. But it took a string of recent scandals before Kalanick finally caved. Former engineer Susan Fowler Rigetti last month published a blog post claiming Uber protected a manager who propositioned her for sex. Several other claims of sexism, sexual harassment and other inappropriate managerial behavior followed. And an Uber executive was forced to resign after it came out that he was accused of sexual harassment while working at Google. Former Attorney General Eric Holder now is leading an investigation into the sexual harassment claims and Uber’s broader workplace culture, at Uber’s request. The investigation is expected to conclude by the end of April. Kapor Klein remained hopeful Tuesday that Uber would change. “We believe that the innovative thinkers that disrupted the transportation sector could potentially be the same collection of minds that can unstick tech’s diversity problem,” she wrote. “They’ve done the impossible before.” The numbers Gender (global employees) Overall: 36.1 percent women, 63.9 percent men Tech jobs: 15.4 percent women, 84.6 percent men Leadership roles: 22 percent women, 78 percent men Race (of all U.S. employees) Asian: 30.9% Black: 8.8% Hispanic: 5.6% Two or more races: 4.3% Other: 0.6% White: 49.8% View Uber’s full diversity report here: www.uber.com/info/diversity   Tags:  Uber Marisa Kendall Marisa Kendall is a technology reporter for The Mercury News, where she covers venture capital and startups.

Since launch, Google has only made a couple of major additions to Assistant’s home control compatible products, but today the company is announcing new partnerships that open up the floodgates wide… The best gifts for Android users Starting today, Google is announcing that smart home products from TP-Link, LIFX, Wink, and Best Buy’s Insignia WiFi Smart Plug will be supported by Google Assistant. These products include color changing bulbs from TP-Link and LIFX, smart outlets from the likes of Insignia and TP-Link, and dozens of other smart home products compatible with the Wink ecosystem. TP-Link revealed to us that Google Home support was coming back at CES 2017, so it’s great to see that the functionality is finally rolling out. The addition of LIFX also adds some of the first “hub-less” smart bulbs to Assistant’s lineup, a huge plus for users who want something a bit simpler. Better yet, the addition of Wink opens up Assistant to interacting with dozens of different smart home products from various brands too, including some thermostats. Cool down and “turn on the fan” with the Best Buy Insignia Wi-Fi Smart Plug Set the mood for your dinner party and “change the living room lights to blue” with LIFX Relax and “dim the living room lights” with TP-Link Get comfortable and “turn up the heat” with Wink In addition to Google’s announcement, August has also revealed that its smart door lock will be supported by Google Home, making it the first smart lock to support all three major digital assistants (HomeKit, Alexa, Assistant). For now, users will only be able to lock their door or check the status of the lock, but the company says it is working with Google to develop a more secure way to enable unlocking the door. Along with those, Logitech Harmony, Geeni, Vivint, First Alert, Rachio, Electrolux Frigidaire, Neato, and Anova will all be supported starting today.

Hangouts 18 doesn’t seem to have any functional changes, but it does add the necessary components to help educate users on the forthcoming transition… Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services As is often the case with changes to Google’s apps, the company is going to make sure current users are aware of the coming changes before pulling the plug on May 27th. For this purpose, there are strings in the app for a banner that will be appearing in Hangouts 18 and later telling users that “SMS is moving out of Hangouts” and suggests that users “switch to another SMS app already on your phone.” <string name=”sms_deprecation_banner_title_text”>SMS is moving out of Hangouts</string> <string name=”sms_deprecation_banner_change_message_text”>SMS texting in Hangouts will soon go away. For text messaging, switch to another SMS app already on your phone. &lt;a href=%s>Learn more&lt;/a></string> You can see what the banner looks like above, but we’re not seeing it on any of our devices at this point. Google will likely be enabling it via a server-side switch in the coming days or weeks. The strings also detail something else Google touched on previously — that Project Fi and Google Voice users will be exempted from these changes, and still be able to use SMS in Hangouts as they have up to this point. “Google Voice texting will still be available in Hangouts,” the strings say. <string name=”sms_deprecation_banner_gv_download_message_text”>”Google Voice texting will still be available in Hangouts. To use your carrier phone number for SMS texting, try Google’s SMS Messenger app.”</string> <string name=”sms_deprecation_banner_gv_tablet_download_message_text”>Google Voice texting will still be available in Hangouts. To use your carrier phone number for SMS texting, install an SMS app.</string> <string name=”sms_deprecation_banner_fi_description”>Standard SMS texting will soon leave Hangouts. To receive and send text messages in Hangouts using your data connection instead, turn on Project Fi SMS messages. &lt;a href=%s>Learn more&lt;/a>.</string> The banner will also apparently help you find and choose the default SMS app that you decide to switch to. <string name=”sms_deprecation_banner_learn_more_button_text”>Learn more</string> <string name=”sms_deprecation_banner_choose_app_button_text”>Choose app</string> We also found a new string which suggests USB heaphones are now an option for audio output: <string name=”menu_item_usb_headphones”>USB headphones</string> Hangouts 18 is rolling out via the Play Store right now, but there’s no reason to be anxious for it since it doesn’t really pack any functional changes. If you want (and know what you’re doing), however, you can manually download and install the latest version of Hangouts from APKMirror. You can also head over to our coverage from last week to read more about the changes coming to Hangouts. Stephen Hall @hallstephenj Stephen is Managing Editor at 9to5Google. Twitter DMs are open.

The latest beta version of the Google app hints that the ability to make commands may soon be coming directly into Assistant. Other new features in 6.16 include payment authentication and a slightly updated visual search interface. Nintendo Switch Version 6.16 features strings that point to the ability to “Teach your assistant” with IFTTT actions. As is, IFTTT makes up for missing third-party integrations with online services and other devices. The strings point to some visual interface, but also the ability to input commands through voice. It’s unclear whether users will need to make an IFTTT account ahead of time. While simple to create, “applets” still require you to go to the IFTTT site or mobile apps. But by adding an interface directly into Assistant, Google will surface this powerful feature to more users. This beta version of the Google app also includes code for authenticating purchases made with Google Home. At the moment, Home devices can be authorized to buy things, but this new code shows a new level of phone authentication. However, a password or fingerprint will only be requested “if suspicious behavior is detected.” Other features include the visual search that we noted in 6.14 featuring a flash to get better images. Meanwhile, version 6.15 added emoji at the bottom of the screen as a tutorial to teach users what they can search for. These features are not yet live, but users can sign up to beta test the Google app here. Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

Join For Free Discover how to protect your applications from known and unknown vulnerabilities. This is part 2 of 'Building Secure Systems Checklist.' For part 1 click here. You have secured a client-server communication with SSL. Well in today's world that is just not enough. You should enable two-factor authentication. By using two-factor authentication you guarantee that even if the PC of the user is compromised, his data won't be.You can use a two-factor service like Google, or implement it yourself. It is easier than it looks. First, you generate a secret code according to TOTP. Store it next to the user account. Generate a QR code based on the TOTP. Scan the QR code. Use a free app to seed the OTP generator. Provide a 30 second OTP from the authenticator to the login screen. For the mobile part, you can use Google Authenticator or FreeOTP (my favorite). For the server-side, if you use java I can recommend this library. Also, enable mutual TLS authentication. If you build an internal app, the best way to verify users is by using mutual TLS. The whole idea is to have the server, request the user certificate (which is stored in a Smart Card or a security device) during the SSL handshake. During user registration, you have to associate the certificate with the user account. After that, you have to check the certificate with a CA, a CRL list, and for expiration. Here is some sample code, using Bouncy Castle.  private boolean checkIfCertificateIsValid(HttpServletRequest request,X509Certificate certificate) {
 try {
   certificate.checkValidity();
// Get CA certificate
   certificate.verify(secureKeystoreSystemService.getCaCertificate().getPublicKey());
   X500Name x500name = new JcaX509CertificateHolder(certificate).getSubject();
   RDN cn = x500name.getRDNs(BCStyle.CN)[0];
// Get CN in this example we use the email of the user   
String certificateEmail = IETFUtils.valueToString(cn.getFirst().getValue());

   // Get user and validate it with the certificate
   UserRedisDTO dto = authority.getUser(request.getHeader(Constants.AUTHORIZATION_HEADER));
   if (!dto.getEmail().equalsIgnoreCase(certificateEmail)) {
     return false;
   }
   User user = userDao.findUserByEmailWithNull(dto.getEmail());
   X509Certificate trustStoreCertificate = trustStoreDao.getCertificateByAlias(certificate.getSerialNumber().toString());
   trustStoreCertificate.checkValidity();
   if (!trustStoreCertificate.getSerialNumber().equals(certificate.getSerialNumber())) {
     return false;
   } else {
   return true;
}
   if (user!=null && StringUtils.isNotEmpty(user.getMutualSslOTPKey())){

   } else {
     return null;
   }
 } catch (Exception e) {
   log.error("ERROR VALIDATING CERT:",e);
   return null;
  }
  return false;
}
} To force the browser to send the user certificate, you should configure your HTTP server to request it. The configuration defers from server to server, but the idea is to set verify required on the SSL connection. For Apache check here. How to send critical data to the user's devices. Today users use a variety of devices to connect to the systems we build. Using PKI is a recommended practice, but how do you share the keys? Easy, use P2P. The trick is to use a P2P client on both user systems and send the sensitive keys, directly, without using an intermediate server that can be compromised. Have a look of WebRTC, as it guarantees end-to-end security and it is easy to implement in a Web/Mobile/Desktop application. You can check our P2P library for starters on how to use WebRTC. Secure your final build. You deploy your code to a server, but what happens if someone changes your code? You have to sign your artifacts for every platform. Most platforms like Android and iOS already require this, but that is not the case with server-side software. If you are using Java for your servers, use the jarsigner tool to sign your deployment. Secure your code. Securing your code is a never ending battle with bugs. Some good practices you have to follow are: Follow the OWASP Top Ten List. Do static code analysis. Create unit tests for critical components. Always escape user input. Do both client-side and server-side verification. Check for buffer overflows. Use prepared statements when communicating with a database. Hold sensitive strings in a char array. Peer-review your code. And last, but not least, if possible open-source your code: Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. Secure Your OS Securing the OS is a critical task for every software system. If possible use OpenBSD/FreeBSD, where the default configuration prevents memory buffer overflows, randomizes mmap, and some other cool stuff. This looses compatibility with some Linux software, but if your app is not using some specific OS services, this should not matter. Anyway, most server applications run on Linux, so here are some steps to secure your Linux (CentOS) boxes: Use LXC containers. By using LXC you separate the app from the other user processes. Forget SE Linux or AppArmour. With LXC you share the kernel but nothing else, so a rogue process, unless it crashes or exploits the kernel, will stay safe. Use Docker, Rocket, or pure LXC. It's up to you. When using containers base them on minimal roots like Alpine. Thus you will minimize the installed base and get PaX and grsec enabled for free Disable root login from SSH -  /etc/ssh/sshd_config  PermitRootLogin no Edit your password policy -  /etc/security/pwquality.conf Example password policy: minlen = 8
minclass = 4
maxsequence = 3
maxrepeat = 3 It's best to use random passwords for each server, and use a Password Manager like Keepassa to store them. You can use pwmake to generate random passwords. Here is an example for 128bit random pass): pwmake 128
QABNEdabEpSoR!ESvoJzucTIkQ Allow remote ssh only by using authentication keys. This way you can always remove a key when someone leaves your organization, and can a keep count of who has access to the servers. Use a generic DENY ALL firewall policy and open ports only on a need to use, basis. Disable physical login from TTY: # cat /dev/null > /etc/securetty Secure your BIOS/EFI with a password. Secure your menu. P.S. The above methods for physical security are not ideal, and given enough time anyone with physical access to the computer can beat them. The only things that help if you have to secure a physical machine are: Full disk encryption. Armed guards. A Faraday cage around the server to prevent electronic signals eavesdropping. Conclusion Security is a never-ending battle. It involves various tools and you are never 100% secure. The thing you can do is mitigate most attack vectors and harden your systems to the point that they are not worth the effort to hack.

Related Content Why the world's biggest advertisers are turning off YouTube Bunnings, Foxtel and Caltex join YouTube ad boycott The video suggests that "Twitter feminists" are "a pack of c---s".  Bunnings, Foxtel and Caltex all pulled ads from YouTube on Monday after becoming aware their ads were running on videos published by racists.  Advertisement Car makers Holden and Kia Australia pulled the pin on YouTube over the weekend after their ads were found on a video that included misogynistic expletives directed at journalist and businesswoman Ita Buttrose.  Meanwhile, Fairfax Media noticed a significant reduction in advertising on YouTube on Tuesday, particularly on any offensive videos already identified in media reports. Google has been scrambling to tighten its controls and has conducted an "extensive review" of its advertising policies in the past week.   SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Google hit: Shares in Google's parent company Alphabet Inc have fallen by 4 per cent.  Photo: AP The UK government kicked off the boycott on March 17 by pulling advertising from YouTube and summoning Google executives to cabinet to explain why government ads were appearing next to extremist material. This followed revelations in London-based paper The Times that offensive videos spouting racist, nationalist, or extremist material were carrying advertising – and receiving revenue from – UK government agencies.  Some of the world's biggest companies have since withdrawn their ads from YouTube, including Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo, Verizon and Walmart.  Google apologised in a blog post and promised to review which videos were monetised. A few days later, it offered advertisers greater control over where their ads appear, but said it would not limit what appeared online.  Group general manager at Atomic 212, Claire Fenner, said organisations needed to keep up with the pace of change in the industry to fully control where their ads appeared.  "What we are seeing is a natural result of the evolution of the industry, but it's not a new issue," she said, adding there used to be similar concerns about ads appearing next to controversial press articles.  "We will never completely eliminate brand safety risks, but as long as we're collectively focused on developing and improving solutions and processes as an industry, we will continue to minimise these risks for advertisers."  Shares in Google's parent company, Alphabet, have fallen 4 per cent from $US872.37 to $US835.14 since the scandal broke.  with Lucy Battersby Related Content Holden, Kia pull YouTube ads over video insulting Ita Advertisement HuffPost Australia Climate Activists Target Westpac ATMs ...

Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google: Separate Out Data In Search Console For www/non-www/http/https? Google: Separate Out Data In Search Console For www/non-www/http/https? Mar 28, 2017 • 7:46 am | (1) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story So last year, Google gave us a way to combine data into sets within Google Search Console. So if you have verified a www, non-www, https, non-https, apps, etc - you can combine them all into a single set and get aggregate data for all of them in one Google Search Console profile. Now, Google's John Mueller is asking on Twitter if you want to do the opposite. John asked, "apart from moves, do you ever want to separate out data for www/non-www/http/https in SC?" Here is the tweet: Dear siteowners, webmasters, SEOs & growthhackers: apart from moves, do you ever want to separate out data for www/non-www/http/https in SC?— John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) March 28, 2017 It is interesting because the response is pretty split. A lot of people saying yes, they want this and a lot of people saying no, they do not want this. Truth is, I suspect it is more logical for a new webmaster to be able to break it out later versus having to combine them to get aggregate data. Most webmasters don't think to set up a profile for www/non-www/http/https etc. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > This Webmaster Wants His Google PageRank Score This Webmaster Wants His Google PageRank Score Mar 28, 2017 • 7:55 am | (12) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story I spotted a thread at the Google Webmaster Help forums that made me laugh, and since you guys are mostly SEOs, I feel you guys need a break and need to laugh also. So check out this thread where this webmaster is dead set on Google giving him his PageRank score. First he asks "why my Google PageRank is still zero?" He goes through everything he has done right as an SEO but his score is still zero, it is not fair! When someone replied that Toolbar PageRank doesn't exist any more, he then goes on to say that instead of that, he wants to "check the PageRank in Search Console? When he was told there is no PageRank score available in Search Console (there use to be ages ago), he then asked for "the official list of the issues that affect the PageRank?" This guy doesn't give up. I do think it would be nice if Gary or John would just give him his PageRank score, so he doesn't have to go insane over not getting it. That would be the nice thing to do, don't you think? Forum discussion at Google Webmaster Help.

The question is coming up more and more these days where webmasters want to know, is my site coming up for Google voice searches and if so, for what queries. Truth is, Google said they were working on this last year but it sounds like they haven't made much progress yet. Gary Illyes responded on Twitter to a question about this saying "we're looking into it." He added that "in theory they're already reported just not highlighted," meaning, the Search Analytics report has the data but there is no way to filter by just voice queries like you can for image searches or other filters in Search Analytics. @Callmenicholi we're looking into it. In theory they're already reported just not highlighted— Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) March 27, 2017 Since we can't get this data in Google Analytics, it would be nice if Google gave it to webmasters in Search Console. The percentage of searches happening over voice search is growing. The last metric we saw was that 20% of mobile searches are voice enabled and if mobile searches are higher than desktop, that can be a big number of many web sites. Would be nice if Google added under Search Analytics, the "search appearance" filter a voice results option, I even hacked it together for them: Forum discussion at Twitter.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > New: Google Rich Results For Podcasts New: Google Rich Results For Podcasts Mar 28, 2017 • 8:35 am | (1) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Google has quietly added new rich results markup for podcasts in the developer center. Aaron Bradley seemed to have first spotted this and posted it on Google+ saying that "a new data type has appeared in the Google reference library of structured data types: podcasts." Google said "you can enable your podcast to appear in Google Search results along with individual episode descriptions and an embedded player for each." This will however only work for searches done on the Google Search app version 6.5 or higher on an Android device or on Google Home. Google said they do want to add "support for Chrome on Android soon." Here is how it might look: I am going to try to add it for my weekly SEO video podcast here and see what happens. So those of you who have Google Home can ask for it on demand. Maybe one day... In order to index a podcast, you must do the following: Expose a valid RSS feed describing the podcast that conforms to the RSS 2.0 specifications as well as the feed requirements described below. The feed must contain at least one episode that conforms to the requirements given on this page. The podcast must have a dedicated homepage with the elements described below. The homepage must have a <link> pointing to your RSS feed. The homepage, the RSS feed, and any non-blocked audio files must be exposed to Googlebot; that is, they must not require a login, and must not be protected by robots.txt or <noindex> tags. If you want your podcast to appear in Google Play, you should also read the Google Play Music podcast RSS feed specifications. The RSS specifications for Google Play Music and Google Search are complimentary but not identical, so if you enable support for one, you neither prevent nor enable support for the other.

Tyler Lizenby/CNET Smart Home by Andrew Gebhart 29 March 2017 3:02 am AEDT @GebAndrew Google Home is catching up to the Amazon Echo A dozen new hardware partners including Logitech Harmony, Lifx and August jump on board with Google's smart home system. by Brian Tong 1:05 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF The Google Home is at last starting to fulfill its potential in the smart home. With a dozen new companies announcing integrations with its platform, the search giant has dramatically increased what its smart speaker can do. Starting today, for most of these new additions, you'll be able to give a voice command to the Google Assistant built into the Google Home smart speaker and control devices from these 12 companies: August Lifx Wink Rachio TP-Link First Alert Vivint Best Buy Insignia Frigidaire Anova Geeni Logitech Harmony It's the first major update to Google's smart speaker since it launched last November. Back then, the Home worked with four platforms: Nest, Philips Hue, SmartThings and IFTTT. As a result, the Home was well behind its chief competitor -- the Amazon Echo -- when it came to controlling the smart home. Since then, Google's new partner announcements have included a few at CES in January, as well as Belkin WeMo lighting products and Honeywell connected thermostats a few weeks after that. Enlarge Image Say the wake words "Hey, Google" or "OK, Google" and you can issue a command to the Home without needing to hit any buttons. Tyler Lizenby/CNET This announcement doesn't quite even the playing field with Amazon, since Amazon's assistant Alexa now has more than 10,000 "skills" -- essentially third-party apps for voice control. Still, it's a big push in the right direction that includes many popular smart home products. It also expands Google Home's abilities into new territory. Previously, the Google Assistant only worked with lights, plugs, switches, thermostats and recently robot vacuums. Today's announcement includes locks, sprinklers, an air conditioner, a sous vide cooker and even a professionally installed smart home system. It comes hot on the heels of the news that the Home is coming to the UK and Europe in April. Google promised a push of this sort back in December of last year, when the company announced it'd be expanding Weave -- the language Google's devices use to speak to each other. Now, that promise is coming to fruition. What we know about these new integrations Enlarge Image Ask Google to lock your door. Chris Monroe/CNET August This is the first lock to work with Google Home. You'll be able to ask the Google assistant to lock your door or check on the status of the lock. Unlike with Alexa, you won't be able to ask Google to unlock your door. August has promised that feature for Google later this year. With Alexa, unlocking the door requires you to say a PIN code. We'll see what extra security measures August puts into place for the Google Home when the time comes. For now, you can control both the first- and second-generation August locks with the Google Assistant as long as you also have the August Connect Wi-Fi Bridge. August now works with Alexa, Apple's HomeKit and Google Home. Lifx Just like with Philips Hue bulbs, you'll now be able to turn your Lifx bulbs on or off, adjust their brightness and change their color with a voice command to the Home. Unlike Philips Hue, Lifx bulbs don't require a hub to connect to the internet. Install your bulbs, link your account in the Google Home app and give your command. Lifx bulbs also work with Alexa, and will soon work with HomeKit. Enlarge Image Control any lighting devices or thermostats you have connected to your Wink Hub. Tyler Lizenby/CNET Wink All Wink-compatible lighting products and thermostats will now work with the Google Home. Wink's lighting products include bulbs, switches, dimmers and outlets. Wink joins SmartThings as the second major smart home platform to work with Google. Wink currently works with Alexa as well, but not HomeKit. Rachio Another new trick for the Google Home, you'll now be able to turn on your garden sprinklers with your voice. The Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller connects to your home's Wi-Fi and monitors the weather to help you water more efficiently. Rachio can control up to 16 zones of in-ground sprinklers, and now you'll be able to command Google to turn those sprinklers on or off or set a weather delay. Rachio works with Alexa as well. Enlarge Image Change the color of your TP-Link bulbs with the Google Home. Chris Monroe/CNET TP-Link Expanding Google's repertoire of bulbs and switches, you'll be able to control any of TP-Link's lighting products with your voice as well. With TP-Link's bulbs, you can change the color, dim the bulbs and turn the lights on and off with your voice. TP-Link even specified the colors you can pick with a voice command: yellow, red, blue, purple, orange, green and pink. Like the rest of these partners so far, TP-Link works with Alexa. Vivint Unlike the rest of the items on the list, you won't be able to take advantage of Vivint's new integration with the Google Home today -- it's due to launch in April. Vivint's also the only item on the list that is a professionally installed, whole-home smart system as opposed to individual do-it-yourself options. Keeping score Everything Alexa can do Everything Google Home can do Amazon Echo vs Google Home Thanks to Vivint's customized setups, Google Home will be able to control types of gadgets not yet available on the DIY front -- including cameras, security systems and garage doors. Pick your package of choice for professional installation, and you'll be able to do the basics with Google's smart speaker as well -- such as controlling lights, locks and thermostats. Vivint offers similar capabilities through packages that include an Amazon Echo. Best Buy Insignia Plug your fan or lamp into the Best Buy Insignia Wi-Fi Smart Plug, and you'll be able to turn it on or off with your voice. As with the rest of Google Home's compatible smart plugs, Insignia also has an Alexa skill. Frigidaire Perhaps making use of Google's existing ability to control the temp via a thermostat, the Frigidaire Cool Connect will let the Google Home keep your place cool. Using your voice, you'll be able to control the temperature settings on Frigidaire's smart air conditioner. You'll also be able to set the fan speed and ask Google about the Cool Connect's current settings. Frigidaire does have a skill enabling similar controls with Amazon's assistant Alexa. Enlarge Image Use your voice to cook a steak. Tyler Lizenby/CNET Anova With the Anova Precision Cooker Bluetooth + Wi-Fi, you can make your sous vide cooking even more high tech with the Google Home. Just like with Anova's Alexa skill, you can use your voice to set the temperature, check the status of your cooker and even search for recipes. Anova expects its Google Home integration to be ready by early next week. Geeni Bringing even more smart lighting products to the table, you'll be able to control Geeni's smart switches and bulbs with Google Home, just like you can with Geeni's Alexa skill. First Alert With the First Alert Wi-Fi Thermostat, Google now offers another option for controlling your temperature with your voice. Similar to First Alert's Alexa skill, you'll be able to set and check on the temperature with the Google Assistant. Logitech Harmony You could already control your TV to an extent with Google Home and Google's Chromecast. Logitech Harmony brings lots of extra talents to Google's digital entertainment repertoire. By creating activities in the Logitech app, you'll be able to tell Google to turn on Netflix, or switch to a specific channel. You'll need to start each command with "OK, Google, ask Harmony to..." though I'd expect Google and Logitech to offer more flexible and intuitive commands soon. Logitech's compatible hubs -- the Harmony Hub, Harmony Companion and Harmony Elite -- also control a variety of third-party smart home devices, so you'll be able to dim the lights, turn on your speakers and launch the HBO app all with a customized command such as, "Hey, Google, ask Harmony to turn on movie time." Logitech has a similar set of skills you can enable with Amazon's Alexa. Finally gaining ground Since all of Google's new partnerships are already tied to Alexa, Google's obviously still playing catch up. Today, though, Google took a sizable chunk out of Alexa's lead. The Google Assistant built into the Home also responds to more flexible language than Amazon's Alexa. Because of that, and thanks to all of these new integrations, Google is already nipping at Amazon's heels in the smart home, despite the Echo's two-year head start.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Google publishes its documentation for open-sourcing technology Jordan Novet@jordannovet March 28, 2017 10:00 AM Tags: Alphabet, Google, open source software Above: Google's new Open Source website. Image Credit: Screenshot Google today is publishing for the first time its internal documentation for how and when to open-source its own technology. Bits and pieces of this information have come out over the years, but now it’s all available for everyone to read, under a Creative Commons license. At the same time, Google is also posting a catalog of its open source projects, along with descriptions of how Google itself uses the tools. Simply put, there has never been anything like that available before. While many of Google’s open source initiatives primarily live on GitHub, that’s not true of all of them — Android and Chromium, for example, are maintained on Google servers. Now it’s easy to browse and search. Google’s attitude toward making code available for free to anyone has fluctuated over the years, Will Norris, a software engineer working in Google’s Open Source Programs Office, told VentureBeat in an interview. But generally speaking, Norris said, “our philosophy toward open source is we’re OK publishing something publicly unless there’s just a really good reason not to. Our default is, ‘Sure, why not?'” Often, an open source project emerges because a Googler or gaggle of Googlers enjoyed building something and wanted to share it, Norris said. There isn’t always a direct business reason, but that’s OK — it probably doesn’t hurt if Google technologies gain adoption outside Google’s doors, and seeing who works on the open source projects could help Google find the brightest talent to go after, too. Open source software is nothing new at Google. The company has operated an open source office for 12 or 13 years and has been involved in open source software communities since its earliest days, Norris said. Microsoft in recent years has stepped up its open source activity, while Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitter, and other large software companies regularly release open source software. Google’s popular open source releases in the past two years include the Go programming language, the Kubernetes container management system, and the TensorFlow deep learning framework. On GitHub alone, Google has more than 4,000 repositories and 100 separate organizations, Norris said. Some software is more widely consumed inside Google than others. Google uses TensorFlow for Android, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Google Search, speech recognition, Google Translate, and YouTube, according to the website for that project. Google employs the Lovefield relational database, meanwhile, for Google Play Movies & TV, Google Play Music, and Inbox by Gmail. The documentation itself is fascinating, too. It says that among other things Google checks to make sure that open source candidates don’t have links to “Google’s ‘secret sauce,'” will help users instead of just competitors, and are clear of legal, patent, and privacy issues. Google’s default license is Apache 2.0, but employees are welcome to inquire about whether they need to use a different one. Google tells employees to take out names and email addresses of Googlers inside source code unless they’ve agreed to have their information included. Code names and internal paths to files shouldn’t be included, either. Google even suggests a command — egrep -r '\.google\.com|@google\.com|google3?/|([0-9]+\.){3}[0-9]+' — for quickly locating email addresses. The documentation also reveals Google’s policies for its employees posting work on github.com, which is of course maintained by the independent startup GitHub. Google suggests that employees keep using their current personal GitHub accounts rather than setting up new work-related GitHub accounts, and it directs employees to tie accounts to their google.com email addresses to “ensure that your commits don’t get flagged as needing a CLA [Contributor License Agreement].” Google doesn’t want employees creating new GitHub organizations for projects — it already has plenty. It does want employees using two-factor authentication when signing in to GitHub, though. Non-Googlers contributing to Google projects can be marked as collaborators but generally not admins. And Google recommends that if a person who’s leaving is the only one working on an open source project and no team will be assuming responsibility, the person should fork the repository. The documentation also provides insight into how Google deals with personal projects. Google lets employees in good standing request consideration by an Invention Assignment Review Committee (IARC) to get a copyright release for their work. Notably, getting IARC approval doesn’t mean that employees also receive patent rights or other intellectual property (IP) rights. A blog post on the news is here.

Skip to main content Electronic Frontier Foundation Defending your rights in the digital world Search form Search Main menu Home About Our Work Deeplinks Blog Press Room Take Action Shop March 28, 2017 | By Gennie Gebhart Privacy By Practice, Not Just By Policy: A System Administrator Advocating for Student Privacy When Matt L. started to raise the alarm about educational technology in his school district, he knew it would ruffle some feathers. As a system administrator (or sysadmin), Matt has had a front-row seat to the increasing use of technology in his rural, public school district. At first, the district only issued Chromebooks to students in guest “kiosk” mode for test-taking. Over time, though, each of the district’s 10,000 students got individual access to school-issued devices, from iPads for younger students who cannot yet type to Chromebooks and G-Suite for Education logins for students as young as third grade. Matt and his sysadmin colleagues are at the center of deploying, configuring, and maintaining Google devices and software for the entire district. This gives Matt opportunities to identify privacy problems with ed tech implementation, and to propose solutions. “All our eggs in one basket” “I don’t want to say that Google or Chromebooks or any of this stuff is inherently bad,” Matt said. “Getting these tools into the hands of kids is hard to argue with. That’s why I got into technology.” As the district has continued to expand its technology use, however, Matt has started to have concerns about consolidating students’ educational and personal information in one company. “We’re putting all our eggs in one basket that we’re not in control of,” he said. “We don’t know where this student data is going.” On top of his privacy concerns, Matt observed students learning about only certain softwares without broader awareness of their technology choices. Having grown up experimenting with Linux and other open softwares, he was dismayed to see students being steered toward only Google services and away from other options. “The beauty of technology is that it is so vast and deep, with so many choices. But we’re funnelling people into one situation, which is not our job,” he said. “We should be teaching concepts of computing, not specific software. We should be giving parents and kids a choice.” Privacy by policy After frustrating initial conversations with colleagues, it became clear to Matt that student privacy advocacy in his district could “get touchy pretty quick.” Even higher-up colleagues who might have been in a position to make district-level changes were hard to effectively approach. “They like Chrome because it’s easy to use and they don’t have to worry much about the mechanics behind it,” he said. “So, I was constantly ridiculed when I brought up concerns about privacy.” Colleagues also pointed out the cost-effectiveness of free Google services in response to Matt’s concerns. But Matt was not convinced. “Nobody's asking why it's free," Matt said. “I thought it was common sense that, generally, if you're not paying for the app, you're the product.” After repeated requests to talk more about student privacy issues, Matt’s boss and members of administration pointed him to the district’s as well as Google’s privacy policies. But this approach of ensuring “privacy by policy” did not lessen Matt’s concerns. “We have privacy policies for our website, and for our student academic records, but not so much for students’ information in regards to what Google is collecting,” he said. “We can’t guarantee what Google is or is not doing with this information. It’s all pretty vague, and it’s not the kind of thing you want to be vague about.” One of the biggest problems with such “privacy by policy” is that it relies on all staff members being up-to-date on complex, sometimes vague policies, and having the time and resources to comply with them consistently. Matt observed that many in his district—including his colleagues in system administration—see student privacy as a long-term issue rather than an active, ongoing project. “Stuff like student privacy gets back-burnered,” Matt said. “It’s hard to look down the road at long-term projects when teachers’ day-to-day is consuming all of our department’s time and energy.” Privacy by practice Unsatisfied by the “privacy by policy” that his district usually practices, Matt is investigating how he can implement “privacy by practice”—that is, prioritizing student privacy with active safeguards to augment and ensure existing policy, like technical settings and opt-out options. His first step has been to “crank down the lid” on privacy settings so that students use Google products as anonymously as possible by default, without associating their online profiles with identifying information. Ideally, technical controls like these will make it harder for teachers or third-party companies to collect student data, making privacy the default in students’ and teachers’ work. He is also advocating for an opt-out policy. EFF helped Matt locate relevant examples of opt-out policies from other school districts to get conversations started. However, this advocacy process has brought up more questions than answers. Coworkers were concerned that giving students the option to opt out of Chromebooks and/or Google services will create more work for teachers and administrators, and it has been hard to build consensus around what classroom alternatives would be available when students choose to opt out. Continuing to advocate Matt’s conversations with colleagues have moved forward in fits and starts, and are constantly changing as the district’s technology situation changes. For example, a system-wide update gave Matt an opportunity to propose concurrent changes in ed tech implementation. But, soon after, discussions about abandoning local storage and migrating completely to Google Drive ran counter to Matt’s efforts to locally control student data and ensure their privacy. In the meantime, Matt is thinking about stepping up student digital literacy education with more student-staff interactions on the topic. He has also brought up his concerns at professional conferences to learn from sysadmin in different schools and districts. Matt remains persistent and committed to advocating for more secure, more private student systems. “It’s a really hard problem, but we need to come up with an answer,” Matt said.

The Google Home is a hands-free smart device powered by the Google Assistant. Using voice commands, consumers can ask it questions, request music or news briefings, and use it to help schedule their personal life. The release follows on the heels of Amazon, which launched the Echo digital personal assistant in Europe in September. Google first unveiled the Home in October. Source: Google Google Home "Google Home is a hands-free smart speaker powered by the Google Assistant that does just that. Whether you want to get answers from Google, turn up the music, sort out some everyday tasks or control compatible smart devices in your home, all you have to do is say 'Ok Google'," said Suveer Kothari, director of product partnerships and planning for Google Home, on a blog post. Google promises the device, which costs £129 ($162), will work with other smart devices in your home, meaning users could control lights, switches and the temperature using voice commands and the Home. Along with the device, the internet giant introduced Google Wifi, a new internet router intended to cope with the increasing number of connected devices in our homes which require high bandwidths. "Google Wifi is a connected system that replaces your current router to bring smarts, security and simplicity to home Wi-Fi to give you consistently strong coverage in your home," said Kothari. Google Wifi uses a technology called mesh Wi-Fi, which creates a network of connections throughout the home, allowing data to more easily between devices.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this Battle of the clouds: Amazon Web Services vs. Microsoft Azure vs. Google Cloud... What's keeping enterprises from using G Suite? Get to know the Premier 100 Class of 2017 Video Choosing technologies to drive digital transformation All the traditional enterprise system vendors (e.g., SAP, Oracle, Salesforce, IBM) have a cloud strategy and product offerings. But not all vendors have the same vision. Recently, Google and Microsoft announced enterprise-focused offerings to lure clients to their cloud-based suites. Google and Microsoft will be fierce competitors in this space, but coming from differing backgrounds, they have divergent offerings. Google for its part has always been a massive cloud player. But its focus on the consumer -- even as it tried to lure businesses over the past couple of years to its web-based Office competing product, G-Suite, and its collaboration suite, Hangouts -- has been limited in success. This is primarily due to the fact that its enterprise-focused features and functions were modest at best, and the appeal for its solution was most notable in SMB. And Google lacked a true client app, relying instead on Chromebooks as a delivery mechanism. But in the past 12-18 months, Google has focused on bringing about a transition in its enterprise solutions offerings. It has hired a number of execs with heavy enterprise solutions expertise, led by industry veteran Diane Greene. The company is transforming the "enterprise lite" offerings into full enterprise-class, mission-critical solutions. Although Google still has a way to go to make the full transition, the recent Google Next conference showed its new direction. G-Suite (now called just Google Cloud) is built on Google's Cloud Platform. Google added key enterprise-friendly features with an emphasis on enhanced security and identity management, such as data loss prevention, multi-factor authentication, automatic data discovery and information redacting of sensitive data, key management, strongly encrypted Google Vault file synching, and e-discovery for compliance requirements. Google is updating its collaboration features as well to be much more competitive with Slack and similar workgroup tools, with Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meets. It's even developed its own chip, called Titan, to allow an established root of trust in future cloud-based processing components, much like ARM does with its TrustZone technology. While much of this expertise is built on Google's extensive experience in managing its own internal enterprise requirements for its 75,000-plus employees (including 700 internal engineers focused on security for its public and private offerings), a good deal of this new focus is being brought about by its maturing vision of what organizations need to take Google seriously as an enterprise provider. The maturity of its new enterprise management team is showing. Microsoft has a different strategy. It has been and continues to be a primary provider of corporate infrastructure for the vast majority of enterprises, with a huge installed base of on-premises solutions in productivity (Office), servers (Windows Server), CRM (Dynamics/LinkedIn) and collaboration (Lync/Skype). As companies migrated to the cloud, Microsoft's Office 365 suite gave companies a feeling of comfort in knowing they were simply moving from on-prem to cloud deployment -- although Office 365 isn't quite equivalent to the end user device deployed version. And Azure was a relatively easy cloud migration of on-prem servers. Microsoft has spent a good deal of time and effort in getting its installed base to adopt Azure as its cloud platform. Indeed, for corporate infrastructure needs, Azure leads both Google and Amazon AWS in presence in large companies (although it has a harder time competing in large cloud-oriented, consumer-focused solutions where AWS dominates). Microsoft has been focused on the enterprise for many years, so it knows well what organizations need in the way of security, manageability and services. This is one of its key competitive strengths. Recently, Microsoft announced a new version of Azure Stack (TP3, which will be available later this year). What's important about this announcement is that it extends the ability of companies to make the choice to transparently place their cloud-based apps in the public or in a private cloud. Azure Stack offers compatibility in app development, tools and management capabilities, as well as ecosystem add-ons. And Microsoft has partnered with systems vendors like HP Enterprise, Lenovo and Cisco to offer turnkey on-prem turnkey solutions. While competitors like Google, AWS and Salesforce concentrate on moving companies to full cloud deployment, the reality is that I expect 75%-85% of enterprises to have on-prem private cloud deployments in place for at least the next three to five years, often in parallel with public cloud solutions. Microsoft's ability to offer a hybrid solution, either hosted on-prem or in their Azure cloud, gives Microsoft a competitive advantage over pure public cloud providers like AWS and Google. Where Google does have an advantage is in leveraging the vast cloud resources and solutions it has put in place and has been refining over many years, honed for consumer needs but now being updated and repurposed for enterprise. Further, many corporate end users are familiar with Google apps from using them as consumers. Nevertheless, transitioning to Google Suite apps from an Office environment may be a hard sell to many companies that require consistency and full compatibility (and that's Office 365's key advantage even with some of its own incompatibilities). Further, the need for a hybrid cloud strategy by most enterprises provides Microsoft a key opportunity. So what's the bottom line? I expect many more enterprises to consider Google Cloud as an alternative to Microsoft, given Google's expanding deployments/scale, new enterprise features, aggressive pricing and widespread adoption and familiarity by users on a personal basis. This will put increasing competitive pressure on Microsoft in pricing (which it has already started to react to) and functionality. But not having an on-premises equivalent to Azure Stack puts Google (and others) at a competitive disadvantage that will be hard to overcome. While I am very positive on Google's new enterprise direction, and expect it to continue to expand, out-competing Microsoft at many companies will be a challenge.

Like the LastPass flaws patched last week, the new issue was discovered and reported to LastPass by Tavis Ormandy, a researcher with Google's Project Zero team. The researcher revealed the vulnerability's existence in a message on Twitter, but didn't publish any technical details about it that could allow attackers to exploit it. According to Ormandy, the flaw affects the latest version of the LastPass browser extension for all major browsers. He claims to have tested the exploit successfully on Windows and Linux, but believes that it likely works on Mac as well. If the extension's binary component is also installed, the vulnerability allows attackers to execute malicious code on users' computers when they visit a rogue website. If the component is not present, the flaw can still be used to extract passwords from users' secure password vaults. [ Further reading: Password-stealing flaws in LastPass Chrome and Firefox extensions ] To make things worse, it seems the extension's presence in the browser is enough for the flaw to be exploitable. Ormandy said on Twitter that the attack still works even if the user is logged out. This is supposedly true only for the remote code execution attack, because without a logged-in session the password vault would remain encrypted and not accessible to a website. "We are now actively addressing the vulnerability," the LastPass developers said Monday in a blog post. "This attack is unique and highly sophisticated. We don’t want to disclose anything specific about the vulnerability or our fix that could reveal anything to less sophisticated but nefarious parties." LastPass recommends that users launch websites for which they have stored passwords directly from inside their password vaults by using the "launch" feature. The company also advises users to turn on two-factor authentication for any online services that offer this option and to beware of phishing attacks and potentially malicious links. Ormandy believes that it will take the company a long time to fix this vulnerability because it is "a major architectural problem." The standard vulnerability disclosure deadline enforced by Google Project Zero is 90 days.

As an assistant professor at the School of Library and Information Sciences, she knows that relieving that angst is her job. “We find students search on Google, decide the first hit is the right one, and then go on with their day,” says Moorefield-Lang. “We also have students who come in and believe if something is on the Internet it must be true. We would like them to know the difference between information that’s research-based [or not] and [between] a scholarly and popular resource.” Preparing students for college is the endeavor of most high school educators. Librarians, in particular, understand the research and critical thinking abilities a college education requires. But often many find themselves hamstrung. If the school has a librarian at all, their scarce resources of time, money, and space may be taken up with test prep requirements at the expense of things such as subscriptions to databases, which nearly every college student will need to know how to navigate. Public libraries, of course, must juggle supporting students with the rest of their constituents—and can only reach those who choose to ask for research help. College librarians, and others who work closely with college freshmen, understand that their high school colleagues are already pressed to do much with little. Yet that doesn’t mean they don’t have a wish list of what first-year students should come armed with in terms of scholarly skills. Pulling the plug on Google As the director of undergraduate programs at Yale University, New Haven, CT, Emily Horning says many incoming students are familiar with databases, but Google dependency is still fairly ­common. So Horning and her colleagues often work with students to refine keyword searches and locate details they need. Her goal is to help them find source materials they wouldn’t discover with a search engine—and have them understand that they’re expected to do this kind of in-depth work at this point in their education. “They realize that the kind of sources their professors will want to see are things they can find in the library,” she says. “Not necessarily poking around on Google.” Nonetheless, students sometimes push back at instruction on how to use databases, or how to work around a gap in the scholarly record. Eliot ­Finkelstein of the College Library at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-M) says students will say they’re switching topics because they can’t find any information on their initial idea. Finkelstein, public services librarian and instruction coordinator for the university’s undergraduate library, knows this attitude reflects today’s culture, in which Google results come up in a nanosecond. But, he says, that’s the antithesis of what college, or scholarly, work is about. Instead, he wants students to understand they’re contributing to a conversation—and are expected to put forward a new, original thought. To do that? Students must invest their time and ideally their excitement. “Research is messy,” says Finkelstein. “If there’s nothing on your topic, or you’re not finding anything, maybe that’s a good thing. Then you can add a point of view that hasn’t been explored and find other sources that can help you bring that out. It’s a discovery process.” Plagiarism school Working with students who don’t know how to quote or cite other people’s materials properly is another hurdle college librarians face. Yale’s Horning sends students to reference books or online sites such as Zotero and EndNote, which can help them format their materials quickly and accurately. Still, there are students who just don’t understand that they must credit others and that failing to do so is plagiarism and not allowed in college. Kent State University, OH, actually runs a so-called plagiarism school, managed by librarians for students who have been caught plagiarizing. The librarians walk the offenders through their papers, explaining the proper method of attribution. If the students get help with the citations, they can sometimes still get a grade for that work, albeit lower than what they would have gotten had they cited appropriately in the first place. “We also have sessions to explain what plagiarism is,” says Jasmine Jefferson, a first-year experience librarian at Kent State. “But students can only come to plagiarism school once.” Freshman wish list Even as college librarians understand, and voice their recognition, that high school librarians are working with limitations, they still wish freshmen had, at least, some familiarity with writing a research paper. “Something beyond a report,” says Sherri Saines, a reference librarian at Ohio University’s Vernon Alden Library in Athens. “A writing exercise in which the student gathers information, digests it, learns something from it, and then writes about it. Our students come without that experience, which is surprising. I have talked with high school librarians, and they say, ‘I lost all that time because of testing.’ It makes me want to scream.” Allison Mackley gets that concern. That’s why the teacher-librarian and library department chair at Hershey High School, PA, runs a semesterlong class called “Ethical Research from Passion to Purpose,” with the end result an original research paper. “The class is becoming more popular because kids realize they need these skills when they start college,” she says. “One student also got an internship in Washington, DC, based on her project, the use of social media in political campaigns.” Cathy Jo Nelson wants to help her 2,400 students at Paul M. Dorman High School in Roebuck, SC, so she invests heavily in databases so the high schoolers are familiar with these online resources before they start college. Nelson estimates the school has about 30 databases available, some paid for by the state and about seven paid for by the school. “Every year the purchase order crosses [the principal’s] desk and he asks if these are necessary,” she says. “We have to justify it every year. But we have a heavy emphasis on making our students college career ready. And one way we do that is by beefing up on subscription databases to make sure [our students are] exposed to what their college environment will be as well.” IdaMae Craddock starts even younger. As the librarian at Burley Middle School (BMS) in Charlottesville, VA, Craddock gets her sixth to eighth graders started by building annotated bibliographies. The middle schoolers learn how to use citations and are taught to recognize a reliable source—and what is not. Craddock knows how important research skills are during the college years. Before working at BMS, she spent three years as the school librarian at Monticello High School, also in Charlottesville, working with AP English students on their research projects, helping them to locate and spot reliable and primary sources. “That’s especially important now at the middle school as we have a Maker Lab in the library,” says Craddock. “So whatever the students want to make, the instructions need to be from a reliable source.” Building partnerships When she was at the high school, Craddock says she partnered with a librarian at the University of Virginia who would come to the school to talk with students about college-level research. She also arranged a field trip so students could find primary sources on their own. Other colleges, among them Kent State and UW-M, say they support that back-and-forth with the high schools in their area. Yet whenever the students show up—as high schoolers or college freshmen—librarians want that first experience of exploring a college library to remain fun. If students feel criticized for not knowing how to research a paper, properly source material, or locate information they need for a project, they’re not only less likely to do well—they’re less likely to ask for help again. Getting hung up on where they are and putting added stress on their experience will only alienate students further. And that doesn’t help them—nor the college hoping to provide their education. “We take them where they are,” says Virginia Tech instruction librarian Carolyn Meier. “We move them forward and show them all the cool stuff we have and what we can do to help them. The more positive you are, the more excited you are, the happier they will be. If you approach them with, ‘This is how you can do this, and it’s easy’ rather than, ‘Why didn’t you learn this in high school?’ it [opens] a better frame of mind for them and a better frame of mind for us.” This article was published in Library Journal's May 15, 2016 issue.

August, Wink, LIFX, TP-Link, Rachio, Vivint, and Best Buy’s Insignia are all announcing integrations with Google Home, allowing owners of their products to issue voice controls through Google’s speaker. TechCrunch reports that First Alert, Frigidaire, Logitech, Geeni, and Anova are also adding integrations. Here’s what some of them will let you do: August will let you lock its smart lock and check whether it’s locked or not (but not unlock it by voice) Wink will let you control lights and thermostats connected to a Wink Hub LIFX will let you control the color and brightness of its lights TP-Link will let you control its smart lights, outlets, and switches Rachio will let you control its sprinkler system by voice Vivint will let you control products connected to its system by voice There’s a good mix of products here that ought to open up some new options for Google Home owners. Companies like August, LIFX, and TP-Link offer products that work over Wi-Fi and can be added into a home without investing in a hub. While Wink and Vivint do require a hub, but include a lot more options for those who’re interested. Taken together, today’s announcements greatly expands what Google Home is capable of doing: until now, it only had device integrations from five companies: Philips Hue, SmartThings, WeMo, Honeywell, and Nest (which Google owns). While these integrations are technically made possibly by the Google Assistant, there unfortunately continues to be a distinction between Google Assistant on Google Home and Google Assistant on phones. August and Rachio tell The Verge that their integrations work on Google Home only, while Wink, LIFX, and TP-Link say their integration will work on phones as well. The announcements follow a Google event in London this morning, where the company announced it would begin selling Google Home in the UK after six months on sale in the US. Google’s multi-unit router system, Google Wifi, is launching in the UK as well, beginning next week. Update March 28th, 12:14PM ET: This story has been updated to note additional integrations.

In addition, Rachio will be compatible with the SmartThings platform as a certified Works with SmartThings partner. These integrations make it even easier for homeowners to control their sprinkler systems. Internet-connected devices are exploding in popularity and expected to hit 46 billion in 2021, a 200 percent increase from 2016 (Juniper Research). As many of these gadgets may not have traditional screen-based interfaces, voice assistants will play an important role in how people engage with them. Rachio’s simple-to-use app lets people manage their sprinkler system from any smart mobile device; the addition of the Google Assistant makes it even more convenient. Now, people can use any supported Google Home device to control almost every aspect of their sprinkler system, by simply saying, “Ok Google, ask Rachio to stop watering,” or “Ok Google, tell Rachio to set a rain delay.” In addition, Rachio is adding the advanced scheduling capabilities of SmartThings to its functionality. SmartThings users can soon add their Rachio controller as a “Thing,” and manage their sprinklers directly within the SmartThings App. Homeowners will appreciate the option to incorporate Rachio into SmartThings routines, such as using a ‘door open’ sensor to stop watering a specific zone. This integration is slated to go live in mid-April. With these new integrations, Rachio further solidifies its position as the most connected smart sprinkler controller on the market and gives homeowners the most flexibility to incorporate Rachio into their existing smart home ecosystems. Rachio’s comprehensive portfolio of smart home integrations currently includes Amazon Alexa, Nest, Xfinity, Control4, Crestron, IFTTT, Nexia and Wink and now the Google Assistant. “The smart home industry is experiencing explosive growth thanks to technologies like voice control. By adding the popular Google Assistant to the Rachio ecosystem, we’re making it even easier for people to make smart choices around irrigation,” said Chris Klein, CEO of Rachio. “We’re committed to staying at the forefront of the smart home by partnering with leaders in the space and continually driving innovation.” Rachio can save homeowners up to 50 percent off their monthly water bill by constantly monitoring weather and automatically adjusting irrigation schedules for precision watering. Rachio’s Weather Intelligence™ taps a home’s Wi-Fi network and connects to a network of thousands of weather stations. It analyzes past and future weather reports, and considers these stats, as well as a yard’s soil type and lawn conditions so homeowners no longer need to worry about watering schedules. The intuitive app enables homeowners to monitor and adjust their schedule from their mobile devices, inspiring yard envy while saving water and money with EPA WaterSense Certified irrigation technology. The Rachio smart sprinkler controller can efficiently manage up to 16 zones, and is compatible with nearly every home sprinkler system.

Conflicts Terrorism Disasters Global Economy Environment Religion Scandals Regions isis ISIS recruiting videos hit YouTube after London attack By Alex Diaz Published March 28, 2017 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 Email Print   ISIS supporters are reportedly on a recruiting blitz in the wake of last week’s deadly terror attacks in London, despite suggestions from British police on Monday that attacker Khalid Masood may not be associated with any terror groups. Hundreds of violent, pro-ISIS videos reportedly have hit the web since Wednesday's attack. According to the Times of London, Google, the owner of YouTube, has apparently failed to take many of them down. One YouTube video viewed by Fox News on Monday showed a series of brutal executions, and encourages followers to “live the cause.”  EXCLUSIVE: FEDERAL COMPLAINT AGAINST BOMBING SUSPECT OMITS JOURNAL'S ISIS REFERENCES ISIS claimed responsibility for last week's attacks that killed four and injured dozens, calling Masood a "soldier" who responded to the group's calls to action. Top UK counter-terrorism officials suggested Monday that while there is no evidence yet that Masood had discussed his plans with others, investigators are focusing on messages that Masood had been sending via encrypted channels. Deputy assistant commissioner Neil Basu, senior national coordinator for UK counter-terrorism, added that "there is clearly an interest in jihad. Neither YouTube nor Google immediately responded to requests from Fox News seeking comment. Just last week, it was disclosed that hundreds of companies are suspending contracts with YouTube/Google after advertisements for popular and even taxpayer-funded entities, like the BBC, began appearing alongside "extremist" videos. Among the more than 250 companies severing ties are advertising giants like Toyota, HSBC and Verizon. Reports suggest that the exodus could cost YouTube upwards of $750 million. In a statement last week in response to the backlash, Google suggested that while it recognized there was an issue with ad placement, "we believe strongly in the freedom of speech and expression on the web -- even when that means we don’t agree with the views expressed." Company policies posted online say YouTube "strictly prohibits content intended to recruit for terrorist organizations ... We also do not permit foreign terrorist organizations to use YouTube." In the past, YouTube has tried to counter the growth of extremist propaganda by emphasizing the need for alternate, positive narratives. Back in 2015, YouTube's Chief Legal Officer David Drummond reportedly told media executives and influencers that they should be focusing on "drowning out" the Islamic State's propaganda machine with "better messages, with reasonable messages." President Barack Obama seemed to pursue a similar strategy in March 2016, approving the creation of a new "Global Engagement Center" within the U.S. government. The group was designed to "counter the messaging and diminish the influence of international terrorist organizations," like the Islamic State and others. PRICEY SUPER BOWL ADS RESURFACE ON YOUTUBE, FRONTING ISIS VIDEOS In an op-ed this month, Marc Ginsberg, former deputy senior adviser for Middle East policy under President Jimmy Carter, suggested that YouTube is a "prime culprit" in the spread of radical ideology. "Without YouTube’s convenience of access for on-line radicalization, the inspirational oxygen vital to ISIS or Al Qaeda terror recruitment would be severely depleted," Ginsberg wrote. Mark D. Wallace, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under President George W Bush, also pointed out that YouTube's policies on propaganda seem at odds with its stance on things like pornography or copyrighted material. "There is something particularly strange when a video-sharing company works so vigorously to discourage one form of behavior," Wallace said in a January op-ed, "but at the same time passively allows viewers to be led to increasingly violent propaganda and content." Steven Stalinsky, the executive director of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), argues that YouTube “isn’t as important as it used to be” for ISIS, and that the company actually does well when it comes to removing the group’s propaganda. “They do deserve credit for removing ISIS content,” Stalinsky says. “But if they get an ‘A’ for removing ISIS content, I give them a ‘C’ at removing other jihadi content.”  Advertisement Trending in World 1 Timeline of events leading up to Brexit 2 Fears for Indonesian park's rare species as Trump town rises 3 With monster trucks and Comic-Con, Saudis defy killjoy image 4 Raqqa residents trapped by militants ahead of assault 5 UK set to file for EU divorce, triggering 2 years to Brexit Site Index Sections Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World Sports Weather On Air Tools Live Video Trending Newsletters Alerts Podcasts Radio Apps & Products About Careers College Students Fox Around the World Advertise With Us New Terms of Use (What's New) New Privacy Policy Ad Choices Help Email Newsroom Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram RSS Newsletters Fox News Back to Top This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

The search engine picked up on the hundreds of customers heading for the bargain meal using its tracking software. Thousands of 1p fish and chip meals have been sold by Papa's today at its two site in Willerby and at Bilton to celebrate being named one of Britain's best chip shops on TV. Families, school pupils and pensioners were among those willing to wait in queues more than an hour long for the offer. At Willerby Hull FC players Mahe Fonua and Jansin Turgut were serving up fish and chips after owner Dino Papas spotted the players in the queue and asked if they'd like to help.

"People will just take it for what it is and head there today before going back to their local takeaway. "Hopefully it will benefit everyone by getting more people eating fish and chips generally." "I just hope larger places like Papas don't swallow up the independent chippies for whom their business is their bread and butter.

Some of those agency executives sat down with clients last weekend to assess the fallout, they told The Post. Some on Wall Street have estimated that as much as $1 billion in ad spending could move away from Google and its various platforms, including YouTube. Last week, Google’s YouTube took a major hit after The Times of London revealed that advertisers, including the British government, had their ads appear adjacent to white nationalist hate-speech videos and sites and other hate groups. US advertisers including AT&T and Verizon yanked their ads from Google’s non-search platforms, creating a cascade of concern among other marketers. “The feeling is, let’s start planning for the inevitable,” an executive at one big marketer said Monday after meeting with a client. Discussed at the meeting was how best to execute a pull-out and what Plan B would look like, the executive said. “If we pull, where can we best place the dollars?” Safe zones discussed included broadcast networks and other video outlets, such as Crackle or Hulu. If you’re buying YouTube ads, you go to the people who make the videos — such as NBC’s “SNL” — instead of buying ads from Google, said one person helping advertisers make sense of the hysteria. Google isn’t the only victim. There will be a ripple effect across all digital, including Facebook and Snapchat. SEE ALSO Google loses more top advertisers amid placement nightmare 0:0 Google saw more big-time advertisers pull their business from its... “This is bad for anyone in digital who deals with user-generated content,” said a digital ad exec. “I think it’s raised a red flag for everyone.” Meanwhile, YouTube executives are agog at the turn of events, especially since marketers have long known that they could end up next to unsavory content in return for big audiences at a fraction of the cost of TV. Google said it has instituted solutions as of Sunday — like the creation of a hotline and a tightening of its algorithm. But Google’s efforts to contain the problem will fall short as long as it lacks a way to read video for context, in the same way technology can read text, one major digital ad executive said. Another person said advertisers’ eagerness to buy audiences, without attention to the content, had helped create the issues. Field Garthwaite, CEO of Iris.TV, which creates video ad initiatives, told The Post in a statement: “Being THE platform benefited YouTube for years in acquiring large audiences, but the lack of control over what content they’re showing ads against is becoming a non-starter for most marketers. Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram may face similar scrutiny in coming months. The winner here: major media companies.” With the TV and digital upfronts around the corner, TV sellers are poised to hone their pitches. Advertisers allocate the majority of their annual ad budgets come May. “There are no conversations that can happen now,” said one digital ad executive about buying on YouTube. “Let’s talk about why Rome is burning.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under advertising ,  digital advertisements ,  google ,  wall street Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next 'One word' sparks ridiculous infighting at ESPN Read Next 'One word' sparks ridiculous infighting at ESPN Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 70,159 Fake doc gets prison for deadly butt injections 34,850 Annette Bening ordered Warren Beatty home after Best Picture fiasco 21,190 Staring at boobs is just one of six easy ways men can live longer Now On How Bill O’Reilly defines a ‘snowflake’ Joe Manganiello: Sofía Vergara worth the intense spotlight Montel Williams no-shows Page Six interview SEE ALL Video 0:43 Trump says he can't make a mistake, then instantly makes a mistake Now On 10 Sex Scenes That Changed Film History SEE ALL More Stories pagesix Annette Bening ordered Warren Beatty home after Best Picture fiasco Now On Decider Alec Baldwin's First Thought When Meeting Tina Fey: "Is She Single?" nypost Fake doc gets prison for deadly butt injections New York Post Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Sections & Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters & Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ & Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network © 2017 NYP Holdings, Inc.

After all, a smart home control hub is only as good as the products it can control, right?  As of today, Google now supports Wink, TP-Link, LIFX, and Best Buy Insignia products. Below are examples from Google of the types of things you can do with these new integrations: Cool down and “turn on the fan” with the Best Buy Insignia Wi-Fi Smart Plug Set the mood for your dinner party and “change the living room lights to blue” with LIFX Relax and “dim the living room lights” with TP-Link Get comfortable and “turn up the heat” with Wink According to CNET, Google is also adding support for August smart locks, Rachio sprinklers, First Alert smoke alarms, Vivent security products (coming in April), select Frigidaire products, Geeni’s line of smart products, and Anova Precision Cookers. Google’s announcement didn’t mention any of these new integrations. On a related note, Google Home and Google WiFi arrive in the UK on April 6.

Jackal Frost I’m waiting to see if they add more smart thermostats, I’d like to upgrade, especially with summer coming, but I can’t afford a 200+ Nest. Would be willing to pay a bit more for the Ecobee, because the remote sensors would be amazing, but, I’ve gotten very accustomed to using Google with my HUE and Wemo stuff. Also really excited for when Philips un-screws-up IKEA bulbs working with HUE, been waiting for cheaper white bulbs to fill out the rest of the house, can’t justify 30-60 dollars for RGB lights everywhere. A Magnet Can’t you get the ecobee working through Samsung SmartThings? Jackal Frost Dunno, don’t have one, don’t really want to buy more accessories. Firelight As a LIFX customer I am thrilled. IFTTT is ok but awkward and not always reliable. I’ll be sure to try this out when I get home! illregal Hey Google, tell alexa to suck it. Raven ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, Wink is what I have been waiting for since I already have a Wink 2 hub so I guess I can finally justify getting one of these 🙂 Jenniferlvincent Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours and have longer with friends & family! !mj194d: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Thanassi Karageorgiou Read this as “Google Home Ads…” and was immediately horrified lol. Fresh360 Google Home is a product I want but can’t really justify buying, similar to my battle with buying a smart watch…The other day I asked Google Assistant a question and forgot I was connected to my Bluetooth speaker, the answer was read thru the speaker and it dawned on me this is a pseudo Google Home… With that said what more can the Google Home do than my phone w/ Google Assistant connected to a speaker? Bryan Honestly, GH probably can’t do much more than what you can with your phone and a BT speaker. What GH does give is an always on, always listening device that doesn’t require you or your phone to be in that room to interact with. If you live alone and always have your phone on you at home, then that’s probably not an issue. But for families or those of us who don’t always have our phone handy, the GH is very convenient for doing the simple stuff it’s good at. Fresh360 Thanks for the reply. I totally get it. Jackal Frost I was thrilled when Google Assistant was announced as coming to all Marshmallow/Nougat phones, because I have some older ones I’d love to just jack into a speaker and make my own Home with. Unfortunately they’re all slightly under the minimum specs of 1.5 GB and 720p screen. Going to be honest, I know Google wants to maintain “the experience” or whatever, but it’d be nice to have the option to force it anyway, with a nice disclaimer along the lines of “I understand I may not have the best experience without meeting these specs” or whatever. I can’t imagine Assistant truly *needs* 1.5 GB of RAM and a 720p screen, Google Now works just fine on these phones. Just waiting for a build.prop edit or something else to bypass these, so I can hook these up to a nice speaker system and have my own Google Home, 130 dollars for a really fancy Bluetooth speaker is just a hard sell for me, when all I really want to do with it is change my lights or turn something off without getting up. Chris “Vivent security products” do you mean Vivint? http://www.vivint.com/ Henry I will be all set once they add in native Lutron Caseta support! Ryan Lutron kind of really has me pissed with how they handle their smart stuff. They own the patent for the “instant status update” and have basically been blocking everyone from using it but dont even really support the stuff well themselves. And then they use 3 different, and incompatible, proprietary protocols for their different product lines. I have their Maestro stuff all through my house and love it for the quality but the moment I started working on the smart home stuff I developed a hatred for them . Maestro doesnt work with Caseta, which means it doesnt work with either voice controller. And Castea is cheap and ugly compared to Maestro, so you dont want to mix. At this point I really wouldn’t mind them suffering in the market, and painfully so. With the way they have hindered the whole z-wave smart home alliance and failed to even put together a good solution themselves they deserve to fail as a company. Jackal Frost I’ve been digging fairly deep into DIY home automation type stuff and this is the first time I’ve heard of them, so, as far as I see it, they’re already failing as a company. Based on your comments here, I think I’ll be steering well clear. You can’t afford to be closed and proprietary with smart home peripherals, and I won’t tolerate it, not with the price tags I see, everything needs IFTTT support at the very least, before I even consider purchasing it. Ryan Do steer clear. GE and Leviton, along with a few smaller companies, are making some standards-complaint stuff but the whole “scene capable” functionality is still limited because Lutron sues the pants of anyone who tries to have the whole “instant status” thing going. Its very “Apple while steve jobs was alive” level assholishness. But with the added sprinkles of their own solution is pretty terrible. Its such a shame because their hardware quality is bar-none. I love the Meastro stuff, its worth the up-charge quality wise. Raven ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I would be surprised if it has the radios to control Lutron, but my Wink 2 hub does and now that they have added Wink support I will finally be buying one to complement my Echo in another room.

Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell / VentureBeat Google Assistant and Google Home users now have a lot more ways to use the intelligent assistant to control lights, locks, and other Internet of Things gadgets as integrations with devices from more than a dozen smart home companies were announced today. Among devices that can now be controlled by voice with Google Assistant include August, Wink, Best Buy Insignia, LIFX, Geeni, and TP-Link, according to a blog post by Google product manager Mark Spates. Wink can control lighting, security, and other smart home devices. Geeni is maker of the Surge smart power strip. LIFX makes lightbulbs. Best Buy Insignia plugs can also be controlled by the intelligent assistant. There are also smart device integrations today for Logitech Harmony, Vivint, First Alert, Rachio, Electrolux Frigidaire, Neato, and Anova, a Google Assistant spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. To control a device, go to the Google Home app, open the menu, and choose Home Control. At the launch of Google Assistant in October 2016, Google Assistant could speak with Philips Hue, Nest, Samsung SmartThings devices. Honeywell and Belkin smart home integrations were made available in January. Since its debut, Google Assistant has been added to all Android phones that use Marshmallow or Nougat, Google Allo, and Android Wear. At the Computer Electronics Show (CES) earlier this year, plans were announced to bring Google Assistant to NVIDIA products as well as televisions from Sharp, Sony, and Xiaomi with Android TV.

Kwikset, Schlage, and Yale smart locks gain Alexa skills Logitech ZeroTouch review: This Android smartphone holder puts Amazon's Alexa... Video See the smart home appliances of the future at Panasonic House Vivint Sky and Wink Hub owners who want to use voice commands to control their lighting, thermostats, and other subsystems will soon no longer be limited to deploying Amazon Echos—both companies announced today that their systems will soon be compatible with Google Assistant, too. Both companies already work with Amazon’s voice assistant, Alexa, but neither wants to be limited to a single platform. “Obviously there’s more than one option for homeowners who want to have voice services in the house,” said Vivint Smart Home Chief Technology Office Jeremy Warren. “We want to make sure we’re providing a great user experience for our customers regardless of which platform they adopt.” Google announced 11 other new partnerships as well, ranging from Logitech Harmony, to August smart locks, to the Anova sous-vide cooker. As for Wink, founder and Chief Technology Officer Nathan Smith wrote in a blog post today “We’re big fans of voice control. Wink was the first smart home platform to work with voice assistants because we recognized how perfectly voice complements other interfaces, like wearables and mobile phones, when it comes to controlling your connected devices.” Of the two companies, Vivint Smart Home is taking the more ambitious approach to embracing Google Home. Subscribers will be able to control any component in the Vivint Smart Home ecosystem, including lighting, door locks, thermostats, and even home security cameras. Saying “OK Google” to a Google Home device or the Vivint Smart Home app on a smartphone, followed by “Tell Vivint I’m hot,” for example, will result in your smart thermostat being turned down. You’ll also be able to do things like arm your security system, close your garage door, turn lights on and off, and lock your doors, provided you have the appropriate smart infrastructure installed. Google provided us with this list of new Google Home partnerships: Anova (sous-vide cookers) August (smart entry locks) Best Buy Insignia (various consumer electronics) Electrolux Frigidaire (home appliances) First Alert (smoke detectors) Geeni (Wi-Fi light bulbs) LIFX (Wi-Fi light bulbs) Logitech Harmony (remote controls) Neato (robotic vacuum cleaners) Rachio (smart irrigation) TP-Link (Wi-Fi light bulbs) Vivint (smart home/home security systems) Wink (smart home systems) Vivint Smart Home With Vivint Smart Home's system, you can use either Google Assistant or Amazon's Alexa to control every component. Price of admission: $49.95 per month plus the cost of the components. Vivint is also working on its own proactive AI, which will make its system even more automatic. Instead of depending on the user to tell the system to turn on the lights or lock the doors at night, Vivint Sky will aggregate data from door/window sensors, your phone’s GPS, and your daily routine—when you turn lights on and off, when you lock the doors and arm/disarm the security system, and so on—and use machine learning to do these things for you automatically (don’t worry, it will ask for your permission, first). Wink Hub and Google Home users will soon be able to control Wink-enabled Nest thermostats and any Wink-compatible lighting products with voice commands, but they won’t be able to lock their smart locks. That’s something you can do with a Wink Hub and Alexa, so presumably that feature will eventually come to Google Home as well. And here’s a bit of good news for anyone who’s invested in one digital assistant and decided to switch to the other: Both Vivint and Wink will let you use both devices simultaneously, so you don’t necessarily need to toss any hardware aside if you switch. You will, on the other hand, need to remember which device is in the best range of your voice so you can utter the correct wake word. In the real world, I think the vast majority of people will settle on one device or the other and very few will mix the two. Wink Wink has you covered if you prefer the DIY approach, but the company's offering is currently stronger with Amazon's Alexa than Google Home. From my experience with both Alexa and Google Home, I think Google has the better product. But Amazon has the clear lead and a great deal of momentum. The company has also made two moves that Google would be wise to copy: First, it introduced a very inexpensive version of the Echo, the Echo Dot. It’s not a very good speaker, but its low price tag makes it easy to put Alexa in every room of your home. Being able to control your devices without needing to yell is essential to a good smart home experience. Second, Amazon is enabling third-party manufacturers to integrate its version of voice control into their own products. You'll soon be able to summon Alexa with everything from your kitchen appliances to the smartphone holder in your car. It's a shrewd strategy designed to make Amazon Voice Service ubiquitous. Nonetheless, these announcements show that it's much too early to count Google out of the race.

We are featuring motels from all over the United States and have partnered with some of the best motels. Onalaska, United States - March 28, 2017 /PressCable/ -- Finding an inexpensive motel using Google as a resource can be a challenge. A new website, Motels Near Me, are doing their best to cure that headache by providing an easy to search motel directory that prides itself on being the world's most comprehensive resource in the area. The end result is more rentals for local businesses and lower prices paid for rooms by guest - a true all around win/win. Anyone who has used Google or any of the other major search engines to try to find a hotel, is likely to notice the results leave a great deal to be desired. Motels Near Me is a new website that's taking aim at that problem, delivering motel search results that include the mom and pop motels Google ignores, greatly increasing the chances of a motel hunter being able to save money without sacrificing quality. Not surprisingly, the new site is off to a very quick start. "We saw a real need that if filled could help two different groups of deserving people - small motel owners and people looking to rent a room without breaking the bank," commented a spokesperson from Motels Near Me. "Our directory delivers what Google certainly doesn't and doesn't want to for whatever reason. We are looking forward to seeing our directory grow even further in the weeks, months and years to come, along with our number of users." According to Motels Near Me, motels are currently featured from over 1,000 cities and all 50 states. This makes it very likely a motel searcher can find a less expensive option where they are at and also support local motel options at the same time, something that's important to many people. Guests have the option of leaving reviews on the site, something which can be a great help to others when they are deciding where to stay and is helping build a high energy, positive community around the site based on trust. Early feedback for Motels Near Me has been very enthusiastic. Jill S., from Boston, recently said in a five star review, "My boyfriend and I recently took a road trip all the way to Las Vegas and it was huge fun. We used Motels Near Me to find inexpensive places to stay along the way, which was super easy and not one was low quality at all. The whole experience was awesome and we know for a fact that Motels Near Me played a huge part in the adventure being so successful. I can't recommend the site enough."

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today updated its main Search application for the iPhone and added a widget for the home screen. Technically, iOS doesn't support true home screen widgets other than those in the notification panel. In order to make it work, a 3D Touch of the Search app brings up a "Trending on Google" widget directly on the screen with breaking news, trends, and hot topics. A quick press of any of the cards takes users to the content in question. The widget doesn't support users' customized Google cards, which are still located in the main Google app. People interested in using the widget will need to turn it on manually in the app's settings. Google added other 3D Touch actions, as well. A hard press on the Google app icon opens a set of quick search actions from the home screen, but it now also lets people start a new search from within the Google app itself. A hard press of the G button on the bottom of the screen opens a new search immediately, and a hard press on search results can provide a preview of the content before opening it fully. The Google Search app also now works more seamlessly with Google's GBoard keyboard for the iPhone. Google Search is free to download from the iTunes App Store. more info at Google » Related Google news iOS news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Now Google Home can control your August Smart Lock Chris Davies - Mar 28, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit August’s Smart Lock has added Google Home support, allowing users to ask the Google Assistant to lock their doors. The functionality which rolls out from today, builds on the smart speaker’s growing range of Internet of Things abilities, which already include controlling lights among other things. However, in the name of security, August isn’t granting full key-holder privileges to the Google Assistant quite yet. The big omission is unlocking the Smart Lock, which at launch is a feature Google Assistant won’t have. It’s seemingly not a matter of whether such an ability is possible, but more that August still wants to make sure such a system would be sufficiently secure. After all, there’s a big difference between controlling home security via voice and doing it through your app. “Today users can lock and check the status of their lock using the Google Assistant,” Jason Johnson, August CEO, said of the integration. “We are also working with the Google team to develop a safe and secure way to allow unlocking via Google Assistant.” According to August, that unlocking support is expected to arrive later in 2017. It’s not an idle concern. Currently, unlocking an August Smart Lock requires either that you have the company’s app with access privileges, or know the PIN for the optional August Smart Keypad. Either way, there’s a lot more security there than merely being able to shout “Ok Google, unlock the front door.” The functionality joins August’s existing support for two other virtual agent assistants. The August Smart Lock could already be commanded via Apple’s HomeKit and Siri, and Amazon’s Alexa on the Echo. Indeed, the company says, this makes its product the first smart lock to deliver support for all three major voice-control platforms. In order for the integration to work, you’ll need not only a first- or second-generation August Smart Lock, but the company’s August Connect WiFi Bridge too. The latter acts as a go-between, bridging the Bluetooth LE connection the lock itself uses with your home WiFi network. A new August Smart Lock is priced at around $200, while the Connect WiFi Bridge is around $65. Of course, you’ll also need to budget the $130 for a Google Home. There’s no word on whether Google Assistant on Android phones, like Google’s own Pixel and Pixel XL, will be adding support for August’s locks too.

Twitter adds video ads to Periscope amid YouTube content uproar  28 Mar 2017 - 17:39 An illustration picture shows the Twitter logo reflected in the eye of a woman in Berlin, November 7, 2013 (REUTERS / Fabrizio Bensch) By Sarah Frier / Bloomberg Twitter Inc. is adding advertising to posts from its Periscope live-broadcasting tool -- but only on the safest videos. As some of the world's largest advertisers pull spending from Google's YouTube video-sharing site amid concerns about placement with potentially offensive material, Twitter is touting that its Periscope ads will be placed predictably and only with high-quality publishers that the marketers choose. ``They'll be able to scale and have complete control about where their message appears on live content on Twitter,'' Matt Derella, Twitter's vice president of global revenue, said in an interview. ``Brands can control and choose the trusted content they want to align their message with.'' It's a difficult promise to make about live content. Periscope users have posted live feeds of violent protests and crimes, for example. The social-media company has a program to work directly with certain publishers, such as media organizations and influencers. When advertising starts on Periscope in the coming weeks, initially on a trial basis, Twitter will share the revenue with those top-tier creators. The ads will play before the videos start rolling. Twitter is struggling to win market share in a digital-ad market dominated by Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google. It may have an opportunity in video as YouTube works to repair relationships with advertisers that saw their commercials play alongside offensive, racist or extremist content. YouTube had been matching ads to videos automatically, as opposed to letting marketers pick the pairings -- a tactic that allowed the site's ad business to grow quickly but now has the company scrambling for technical solutions. Periscope's progress will be slower, with an invitation-only trial to start, Derella said. Twitter wouldn't say how much of the video on its site comes from its Periscope tool -- only that many millions of hours of Periscope are watched every month. The company is betting on video advertising to help boost its sales, which have slowed in recent quarters and are expected to post their first annual decline this year.

The latest bug, spotted by Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy, affects the most recent version of LastPass for Google Chrome. In a blog post, LastPass acknowledged the issued and said, “we are now actively addressing the vulnerability.” Read: Security Flaw Found In LastPass On Google Chrome, Firefox Details of the vulnerability itself are sparse—neither Ormandy nor LastPass are revealing much until the problem is fixed. However, the issue has been described as being client-side and LastPass described the potential attack as “unique and highly sophisticated.” The password manager service also suggested its users take three precautions in order to protect themselves from client-side issues. First, LastPass recommended its subscribers use LastPass Vault—the page that contains all a user’s information—as a launch pad to open sites directly rather than using the browser extension. LastPass also advised its users to make sure they use two-factor authentication whenever possible. Doing so adds an extra security check before allowing a user to login to a site by requiring them to verify their login attempt was real. This often requires a second device that will receive a temporary code to login with. Finally, LastPass warns users to keep an eye out for phishing attacks. The email-based attacks are still surprisingly common and effective, as all it takes is clicking one wrong link to accidentally surrender a considerable amount of access to your accounts. Read: Digital Privacy: Keeping Your Personal Data, Devices Safe LastPass has had a rough couple weeks when it comes to reported vulnerabilities. Ormandy pointed out two issues to the company last week that affected the browser extensions for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Those issues were patched nearly immediately—in less than 24 hours—and automatic updates were pushed to users to ensure they were not at risk. “Very impressed with how fast LastPass responds to vulnerability reports. If only all vendors were this responsive,” Ormandy said in a tweet.

Google desperately needs a simple messaging strategy Google removing SMS integration from Hangouts: Here's why Video MWC 2017: Top phones get a new lease on life Table of Contents Category I: People who use Hangouts for SMS with a regular carrier-connected number (not with Google Voice or Project Fi) Category II: People who use Hangouts for SMS with a Google Voice number Category III: People who use Hangouts for SMS with a Project Fi number But wait! What about non-SMS chatting? Can I keep using Hangouts for that? Show More So you've heard the news, right? Google is officially pulling the plug on Hangouts' ability to handle SMS messages, just three years after ceremoniously adding that function into the app. The goal back in 2013 was to turn Hangouts into a truly universal messaging solution -- a single spectacular standard that'd work across all platforms and types of devices. Yeah. So much for that. These days, Google is intent on converting Hangouts into an enterprise-targeted tool -- and at the same time, pushing regular consumer users toward its newer Allo and Duo chat apps. Unfortunately, both of those apps suffer from the same foundational problem. And neither is designed to handle SMS. We could talk for days about the confusion and frustration caused by Google's ever-shifting vision for its mobile messaging products -- but we've done that plenty before (I'm particularly proud of the time I used an imaginary conversation to drive home the point earlier this year). So instead, let's accept that an SMS-free Hangouts is the new reality -- and let's move on to discussing what that actually means and what we should all do next. As it turns out, this latest pivot is pretty nuanced, so the answers really depend on your specific situation (yuuuup). Below is a piece-by-piece breakdown along with my advice for each scenario. Find the category and subcategory that applies to you, and get a move on. (A quick heads-up: Regardless of when you make the move from Hangouts or where you go next, you're almost certainly going to have to leave your message history behind. This is due to an apparent annoying quirk with the way Hangouts stores its data; in short, Hangouts doesn't appear to store messages in the global Android SMS/MMS database, as most messaging apps do -- and as a result, there's no way for other apps to import said messages in the way they normally would. Google does offer a way to download all of your data out of Hangouts as a single file, but the file is formatted in a way that'll make it impossible to read and of little practical use. You can continue to access your archives as needed within the Hangouts app -- for now, at least. Beyond that, your best bet is to rely on Gmail as a way to view old Hangouts threads. You can find all of your Hangouts SMS and messaging conversations there by searching for the name or number of the person with whom you chatted.) Category I: People who use Hangouts for SMS with a regular carrier-connected number (not with Google Voice or Project Fi) If this description fits you, the clock is ticking. Starting May 22nd, you'll no longer be able to use Hangouts to handle your SMS text messages -- period, end of story. So what to do? Choose your own adventure: If all you want is basic texting -- and you don't care about keeping your messages backed up or available on multiple devices: Get Android Messages. Google's new SMS-only texting app is clean, simple, and easy to use. It's now the default messaging app for Android as a platform, and it'll get the job done without any fuss or frills. (And yes, it's that same app. And yes, I know.) Android Messages also supports the next-gen RCS messaging standard, so if/when any significant number of carriers and manufacturers gets on board with that system in the future, you'll be ready to roll. Android Messages doesn't, however, back up and sync your messages so you can easily keep them when you change phones -- nor does it let you access your messages from multiple devices (e.g. a tablet) or platforms (via any sort of desktop or web app). And that's where our next option comes into play. If you want to have your messages automatically backed up and restored on any device you use -- and/or want the ability to send and receive texts from multiple devices/platforms: Get Pulse. There are plenty of good messaging apps on Android, but Pulse is the one I personally use post-Hangouts, and it's what I'd recommend for most people. Why? It's intuitive, nicely designed, and simple to use right out of the box -- but it also has plenty of more advanced customization options for those who want 'em. And, crucially, it makes it dead-simple to sync your messages and access them from any device, anytime. (The app is developed by Luke Klinker, by the way -- the same guy behind Talon and EvolveSMS and someone I profiled as part of my How I Use Android series last fall.) Pulse is basically like a better version of Hangouts, quite frankly -- at least, the SMS-specific side of the equation. It lets you do things like pin messages to the top of your messaging list, create custom color profiles for different conversations, search through your messages for a specific term (imagine that!), and use common-sense gestures to get around the app. As for multidevice use, the main Pulse Android app works on phones, tablets, and even Android TV devices. It's optimized to work well with Android Wear watches. And for the desktop warriors among us, there's a companion Chrome extension, standalone Chrome app, Firefox extension, and regular web interface all waiting and available. (The Chrome extension and Chrome app are pretty similar, incidentally. The extension starts in your browser's toolbar and can be popped out into its own window from there, while the app operates as its own independent window from the get-go. The extension also has more options when it comes to things like notifications.) The basic Pulse Android app is free, but you will have to pony up a few bucks if you want to sync messages and/or use the app in multiple places. You can choose from paying 99 cents a month, $1.99 every three months, $5.99 a year, or a flat one-time $10.99 fee for a lifetime subscription. That fee allows the developer to provide strong end-to-end encryption (more on that here) and also, y'know, to make a living. Category II: People who use Hangouts for SMS with a Google Voice number Congratulations! If you're using a Google Voice number, you can stick with Hangouts for now. That being said, it seems safe to say the writing's on the wall. Google may not be ready to pull the plug on Hangouts-Google Voice integration just yet, but it's likely only a matter of time until that happens. So, you've got a few choices: If you want to stick it out with Hangouts until Google actually forces you to jump ship: Hey, go for it. As of now, there is no formal plan for removing GV support from the Hangouts app. Just don't get too comfy. Google's making it abundantly clear that it wants to free Hangouts from its previous consumer-centric purposes, and it's hard to see it as anything but inevitable that GV texting will come on the chopping block soon. If you want go ahead and say so-long to Hangouts now: Go back to the official Google Voice app. Google actually updated the thing for the first time in ages earlier this year, and it's pretty decent now. You can find refreshed versions of the Android app, iOS app, and web app. (The Chrome extension hasn't been updated since 2013, unfortunately, but its basic messaging feature still works. You'll just have to ignore the old voice calling option that's strangely still present as a nonfunctional option.) Category III: People who use Hangouts for SMS with a Project Fi number Fi folk are in the same boat as Google Voice users in that there's no immediate need to ditch Hangouts yet. Again, though, it's almost certainly just a matter of time until that axe falls. So think about what you'd rather do: If you want to stick it out with Hangouts until Google actually forces you to jump ship: Then don't change a thing. The upcoming May 22 kill date for SMS support in Hangouts does not apply to Project Fi subscribers, and Google has yet to divulge any specifics about if/when Fi users will be forced out in the future. Just don't get too cozy, 'cause the safe bet is that your eviction notice will arrive before long. If you want go ahead and say so-long to Hangouts now -- and you don't care about keeping your messages backed up or available on multiple devices: Why put off the inevitable, right? If you're ready to move on and save yourself the trouble later -- and all you want to do is send messages from a single device -- Google's Android Messages app is the simplest way to do it. No frills, no fuss -- just a clean and simple app that gets the basics done, as I outlined above. Just note that after you open up the new app and approve the prompt to make it your default SMS application, you'll need to take one further step: Go back into Hangouts, open its settings, and select your account on the screen that appears. Find the section labeled "Project Fi calls and SMS" and uncheck the toggle next to "Messages." That'll finish removing the link between Hangouts and your messages; if you don't do that, things will be noticeably funky. If you want go ahead and say so-long to Hangouts now and want to have your messages automatically backed up and restored on any device you use -- and/or want the ability to send and receive texts from multiple devices/platforms: Get Pulse. See my full explanation above for all the nitty-gritty. Again, though: Note that after you open up the new app and approve the prompt to make it your default SMS application, you'll need to go back into your account's section of the Hangouts settings and uncheck the toggle next to "Messages" under the "Project Fi calls and SMS" header in order to complete the transition. But wait! What about non-SMS chatting? Can I keep using Hangouts for that? Yes! No matter which of the above categories you fall into, you can keep using Hangouts for IM-style "chat" messages as long as you'd like. At some point down the line, you'll be prompted to switch from the Hangouts app you know now to the newer Hangouts Chat app, but the basic functionality should remain the same. Just note that without SMS support present, Hangouts will essentially just be another isolated chat service -- one that, in other words, will work only for communicating with people who are also actively signed in. And I'd argue that the pool of present people will diminish pretty quickly once the SMS switch gets turned off and folks start moving away from the app for day-to-day use. Particularly with the ongoing pivot to enterprise-oriented features and the fact that Google is no longer preloading Hangouts on Android phones as the default messaging app, the incentive for regular consumers to use Hangouts in any way is only going to keep decreasing over time. So if you really want a chatting app beyond just basic SMS, take your pick. You can try out Google's Allo -- if, um, you know either of the other people who actively use it (and if you don't mind having an app that works only on a single phone, with no multidevice support or desktop interface). Or you can go with any of the more established chat platforms, like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or any of the other popular communication apps of the moment. If none of those options sounds enticing, just stick with SMS for your text-based communication. Or you can always just wait a little while and see what other options show up in the foreseeable future. If history is any indication, it shouldn't be long before Google comes out with Yet Another New Messaging Service for you to consider.

By David Gilbert March 28, 2017 16:35 BST Close Head of Google Europe apologises for online adverts appearing near extremist material ITN For all its moonshots, funky offices, and perception that it is a technology company, Google's main business is it sells ads. It may prefer to talk about self-driving cars, robots that will give you nightmares and its work at the cutting edge of AI, but to fund all these headline grabbing projects, the company sells ads. It may not like to talk about it too much, but in the internet age, it is very good at it. Unfortunately, Google now has no choice but to talk about its advertising model. An investigation by the Times, revealed that major brand names, including Marks & Spencer, McDonald's and Tesco found that their ads were being placed on videos from rape apologists, anti-Semites and those preaching terrorist propaganda. There were taxpayer-funded ads from government departments. Brands quickly pulled their advertising money from YouTube in the UK and Google's EMEA chief Matt Brittin even apologised publicly for the failing of his company. It was not a good look for Google and its "don't be evil" motto. Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer tried to sooth advertisers worries saying: "In the coming days and months, we're introducing new tools for advertisers to more easily and consistently manage where their ads appear across YouTube and the web." It didn't work. The problem spread to Ireland and then the US where giants like AT&T and Verizon said they were withdrawing from the platform. And despite Google's hand-wringing and promises the issue would get better, the problems persist. On Thursday (23 March) Bloomberg found that major advertisers across Europe and Asia are still appearing alongside extremist YouTube videos. An English Defence League video was accompanied by ads from Total, Netflix, IBM and Tag Heuer. Viewers in Germany, France and South Africa saw an anti-Semitic video proclaiming the existence of a "Jewish World Order" alongside ads from AXA, Total and Range Rover respectively. Enemy of the state The result is that Google has now seen as an enemy of the state by some and in recent days some news outlets have sought to conflate one issue with another. Last week, in the wake of the terror attack on Parliament, the Daily Mail called the company "the terrorists' friend" simply because you can search online for a terrorist manual on how to carry out a terror attack using a car. Of course this sort of idiocy only serves to do the work of the terrorists for them – further instilling fear and hatred among the public – but it also makes Google seem in league with the terrorists and extremists when clearly this is not the case. It's no surprise that Google has not been able to fix the problem quickly however. To put the challenge in context, in the time you have been reading this article so far, about 400 more hours of new video content have been uploaded to YouTube. Between now and tomorrow more than half a million hours of video will have been uploaded. Over the course of a year, that's 210 billion hours of video. As technology analyst Ben Thompson points out, Google would need to employ 100,000 people working full time to watch everything that is uploaded onto YouTube. Human curation is not practical and Google is investing a lot in machine learning to try and automatically remove extremist content, but there is more the company should be doing – and this may now force it to change things more quickly. And yet, despite all this concern and indignation, have you noticed that the advertisers and their agencies are not unilaterally saying goodbye to Google? Instead they are "pausing" ad campaigns and this is seen as "a temporary move". This is because the ad agencies no longer call the shots. The changing advertising landscape Very few brands – and certainly no major ones – buy ads directly. Ever since there was more than just a single place to place ads for your product or services, we have had ad agencies. The first one opened in 1841 and it offered to use its relationship with all the newspapers on the market at the time to get brands better rates as well as handling the job of knowing where to place their ads and when. As the popularity of radio and in particular TV grew, the need for such agencies became even more important, especially for big brands who needed help crafting television ads. This led to the rise of the powerful Madison Avenue advertising agencies and ad men of the 1960s — epitomized by the the dapper Don Draper character in AMC's Mad Men. Then, along came the internet and suddenly the old models didn't work so well anymore. As the internet has evolved, two big players emerged – Google and Facebook – and these two companies now hold all the power because their have all the users. And of course they are responsible for making sure the ads on their network are placed in the right place, but surely the ad agencies – who now have a lot less work to do because the effectively only have to deal with two companies – should be doing more to protect their clients? "Advertisers and ad agencies should be accountable as well," Thompson says. "If ad agencies want to be relevant in digital advertising, then they need to generate value independent of managing creative and ad placement: policing their clients' ads would be an excellent place to start. If The Times can do it so can WPP and the Havas Group." This is not a problem which is going to go away anytime soon, but for brands who want to continue to leverage the power of Facebook and Google user bases, they need to make their ad agencies work for their money.

Google Wifi now available to buy: How does the mesh router work? You can buy multiple routers to form a mesh network. You basically put several of these discs around your home to boost your network, allowing you to get Wi-Fi signal everywhere, from your bathroom to your basement. Think of Google Wifi as an expandable system for better coverage. Instead of one router, multiple routers work together to deliver fast input to throughout your home, Google said. It's basically a modular system. Google Wifi has a feature called Network Assist that allows it to actively manage and optimise your network behind the scenes so you don't have to adjust settings. Google Wifi handles networking automatically, picking channels, etc, and it keeps the signal strong in every corner of your house by transitioning your device to the best router for less congestion and better speed. Although Google Wifi can optimise service without your input, you can still control it through a companion smartphone app. You can even manage several features, including the Wi-Fi access of your kids. Google said, "You don't have to shut down the router, just go to the app and hit pause." Google Wifi will be available in the UK from 6 April for £129 for one router or £229 for a pack of two. Google Home UK release date and price revealed The launch of Google Wifi in the UK follows the much anticipated arrival of Google Home, Google's always-on assistant and rival to Amazon Echo.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About March 29, 2017 Source Parts on TaoBao: An Insider’s Guide 34 Comments by: Naomi Wu March 28, 2017 For hardware aficionados and Makers, trips to Shenzhen’s Huaqiangbei have become something of a pilgrimage. While Huaqiangbei is a tremendous and still active resource, increasingly both Chinese and foreign hardware developers do their sourcing for components on TaoBao. The selection is vastly greater and with delivery times rarely over 48 hours and frequently under 24 hours for local purchases it fits in nicely with the high-speed pace of Shenzhen’s hardware ecosystem. For overseas buyers, while the cost of Taobao is comparable to, or slightly less than AliExpress and Chinese online stores, the selection is again, many, many times the size. Learning how to effectively source parts from Taobao will be both entertaining and empowering. XKCD: Up Goer Five Understanding How Chinese Works is Helpful You can find nearly anything on TaoBao, if you know the Chinese name for it. This doesn’t mean you need to speak Chinese, but you should understand how it works. While the site can be navigated using Google Translate, it can’t accept English language searches. Figuring out what an object or part is called in Chinese is therefore the first and largest challenge. Once you find that string of characters you don’t need to be able to read it any more than any other snippet of code needs to be human readable in order to be manipulated. So long as you know roughly what the code represents that’s all that you need. In Bunnie Huang’s Essential Guide to Electronics in Shenzhen (yes, it is (absolutely essential), Bunnie compares Chinese to XKCD’s Up Goer Five. This installment of the comic uses “only the ten hundred words people use the most often” to explain all the parts of a rocket. It’s a very accurate analogy, and once non-Chinese speakers grasp this they are able to more accurately define their search terms when sourcing online. A few thousand words are used to describe a huge number of components. Often in a pretty intuitive way if you break it down. A 电脑 (Diànnǎo), directly translates as “Electric Brain” or a computer in English. While most Chinese characters have diverged so far from their origins to be unrecognizable — 电 (Diàn) or “electric” is one you’ll see a lot. This character is a representation of a cloud with a lightning bolt going to ground. Likewise, a 手机 Shǒujī or “Hand Machine” is a mobile phone, and 手 still looks a bit like fingers on a hand. If you keep this structure in mind — that Chinese part names are rarely one dedicated word, and more of a semi-intuitive set of keywords — it will make finding those names much easier. Finding Your Part by Name Some parts you can simply use Google Translate, but sometimes it’s not specific enough or returns the wrong context for that word. In that case, it’s best to use technical websites that have been localized into Chinese as a resource. For electronic parts the .com and .cn versions of the Mouser site are interchangeable. Mostly just the category names are translated but that can get you very close and is useful for working with Chinese engineers. You can send them the URL of the type of part you want, there is a picture and no confusion. They can do the same for English speakers but in reverse. So: http://www.mouser.com/Sensors/Capacitive-Touch-Sensors/_/N-1b8oy/ becomes http://www.mouser.cn/Sensors/Capacitive-Touch-Sensors/_/N-1b8oy/ For mechanical parts, Misumi offers similar functionality by replacing “us” with “cn”. https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/mech/M1500000000/M1501000000/M1501030000/M1501030100/ becomes http://cn.misumi-ec.com/vona2/mech/M1500000000/M1501000000/M1501030000/M1501030100/ Refining your search Google Translating “switch” will get you “开关” You can paste that into the TaoBao search field and get a large and somewhat random collection of mostly AC light switches. But if we make the string “开关 DPDT” things start to get more useful. When possible add the numbers for the voltage, amperage etc. required and it will get you a lot closer. If we see something pretty close to what we want we have two options, the first is to mouse-over the product image. An orange bar will come up, it may give you the option to “找相似” or “Find Similar”. Clicking on this will bring up things that are close, but not identical to that product. If there is no option to “Find Similar” you can copy the Chinese description into Google Translate for more useful keywords. 6只脚DPDT蓝色MINI小型SMTS-202双刀双通钮子开关 YW2-102 and Google Translate tells us the string “双刀双通钮子开关” is “Double pole double button switch”. A search using that string gets us a large number of similar switches to choose from. Finding Your Part by Image Taobao has a very clever search-by-image function. If you have an image of the part you want you can use that to search. It’s the little camera icon on the right hand side of the search bar. This has a number of uses: finding the upstream distributors of products, finding unauthorized copies of products, and seeing if new Crowdfunding campaigns are based on pre-existing Chinese products. Making Your Order Unlike Amazon, the “Buy” button on Taobao is more an invitation to chat about buying with the store owner. There’s usually a certain amount of required conversation. Some non-Chinese speakers copy and paste a “sorry I don’t speak Chinese” boilerplate but many stores won’t fulfill an order based on this because they are concerned that miscommunication will lead to a bad review which will cost them more than the profit on the item. This process of chatting for more than half of all orders and lack of a straightforward shopping-cart-and-buy-it process means it can be difficult for those who can’t read Chinese to make TaoBao purchases. They also don’t accept PayPal and while supposedly there is a process to accept Western credit cards I don’t know anyone who’s set it up successfully. Fortunately, there are services that will simply take care of this on you behalf. You send them links to the products you want and for a modest fee they take care of the rest. These brokers buy the items, charge it to your PayPal or credit card, accept the packages on your behalf, consolidate them and then forward them to you. Usually, the cost of the item plus this service fee is still less than purchasing the same items through AliExpress and gives you access to a far larger selection. Some TaoBao brokers (in no order): https://www.bhiner.com https://www.taobaoring.com http://www.yoybuy.com/en/ When in Shenzhen, Ringy provides translation services for free over WeChat and can have the packages sent to your hotel. WeChat: ringyringy Things to Avoid “Will it be ready by Monday” Never ask if it will be ready by a specific date, the answer will almost always be “yes”. There’s nothing much you can do if it’s not, so they have no reason to lose the sale. So when dealing with your TaoBao broker don’t ask “Can they have it ready by Monday?”, instead ask “What day do they say it will be ready?” and you get a much more accurate answer. In general, this pattern should be followed when sourcing in China. Ask “What colors does it come in?” before the much more problematic “can they make it in pink?”. It’s far easier to be successful when working within the supplier’s established timeline and product range then starting out with something new. “What do you want it for?” Never answer this question from a store owner. This means they want to know if they can substitute something else based on what imagine will suffice for your requirements. Why would a 3D printer heated bed need an expensive sheet of PEI? Acrylic should be fine. You’ll get a very nice sheet of PEI colored acrylic for a bit less than the cost of PEI but a lot more than what acrylic costs. Stick with the item as listed on the BOM, if they don’t know what it’s for there is more risk of a substitution failing immediately and a poor review. Avoid buying anything that has not been reviewed by other buyers. Are their fake reviews? Sure, tons of them (although it’s getting better). But they cost money for the store owners to purchase and usually there are authentic ones as well — that’s cost sunk into that listing. If a listing has no feedback, a store owner loses nothing by simply taking it down in the event that you (or the agent on your behalf) gives it a bad review. Don’t Bargain Hunt The “get it cheaper” part is already done with when you made your choice to use TaoBao instead of a distributor back in the West. Further attempts to save money will result in problems. Everyone on Taobao sources from the same factories, if an identical or very similar product is much cheaper there’s a reason for it. Look at the top five most popular listings for a part, the average price of those or higher is what you can expect to pay. While there are certainly challenges to sourcing on TaoBao, for any hardware enthusiast the vast, and frequently customizable selection available make it a very useful resource and skill set to have should the need arise.

You pay them and get a HQB address to send your stuff to. Check them out, much cheaper than those agents. Buying from taobao is super fun while in Shenzhen, you can spend a day scouring through the hqb markets and not find what you wanted, or you can order it on taobao and find it by your apartment complex guard the next day.

Report comment Reply RoGeorge says: March 28, 2017 at 8:46 am Thanks for the good advice! Please let me give an advice, too. NEVER talk about yourself at 3’rd person, and NEVER add self validation statements like this: “Naomi Wu is a hardware enthusiast and Shenzhen native. The above guide was compiled with the generous assistance of the Shenzhen hardware community.” It makes you look insecure, and makes readers wondering themselves why do you need to justify yourself without a direct question from somebody else. Otherwise, it was an interesting read, well done! Report comment Reply notarealemail says: March 28, 2017 at 8:51 am There are a lot of people here who want that 3rd-person bit at the end. Report comment Reply Sheldon says: March 28, 2017 at 9:12 am Or, maybe Naomi didn’t add that bit of text at the bottom. Perhaps it was added by the editors of HaD seeing as she is effectively a guest author and not everyone will know who she is or what authority she is talking from. It’s not a new thing to do (both on here and generally in professional publications). Was the italics text too subtle? Report comment Reply Andy Dodd says: March 28, 2017 at 9:53 am Yeah. Such blurbs are pretty much standard for newspapers, etc. (They have been slowly getting replaced with clickable links, but again – I see such blurbs all the time) Report comment Reply RoGeorge says: March 28, 2017 at 10:12 am Since you asked a direct question, it would be rude to ignore it. Subtle? No. Misused? Maybe. I don’t know. https://www.google.ro/search?q=when+to+use+italics I don’t want to argue here about my personal opinions/advice, and I totally understand some people might require an “authority” to tell them what is good and what is wrong. As I already said, for me the writing was interesting no matter who wrote it, so welcome @Naomi Wu, I’m looking forward for your new writings. :o) Report comment Reply B says: March 28, 2017 at 11:23 am I think articles should have their titles at the end rather than the start.

China really needs to sort it’s shit out, the honest companies who sell quality products are suffering because nobody can tell them from some kid with a bedroom full of stuff he nicked out of the bins round the back of a factory. A multi-billion dollar black market is no foundation for an economy. Does the PRC government only keep total control over what their citizens say and think? Not interested in the way they do business? Back when the Silk Road was still going, I heard it was normal for people’s orders of Class-A drugs to come through with no trouble. Very few scams. Says something for China when a bunch of drug dealers are more honest and reliable than they are. What do the Chinese people think of all this? I’ve heard the Chinese attitude is that to rip someone off is seen as wise, clever, good business, making extra profit out of nothing. I wouldn’t want to be in one of their tower blocks in an earthquake. How do they live in a country where everything is third-rate ersatz garbage? Where kettles heat water by simply passing mains voltage through it? Xmas lights where the LEDs are at mains potential connected by cheap bell wire. Is it something to do with going from a country of peasant farmers, to a modern high-tech consumer society, in the space of a couple of decades, rather than centuries in the West? Report comment Reply Valentin says: March 28, 2017 at 1:21 pm You are spot on. You also have to consider how individuals in the Chinese Parliament are primarily of the “Lost Generation” (Born mid 50’s to early 70’s). Of which these people merely DO NOT care about any sort of occupational safety and health. I work for a Chinese dude in a computer store from this. Basically made a business by swapping easily-serviceable computer parts. (HDD’s, RAM, PSU, etc.) Economy has changed now a days for the worst, and people aren’t willing to pay prices they used to for repairs, Thus making this business model irrelevant. This guy stacks laptops like Pancakes, and graphics cards in piles like greeting cards. Places a powered on heat-gun in a cardboard box. No regard whatsoever for cleanliness, organization, or keeping track of inventory. Gets away with all of it by brown-nosing the license inspector. They live like nomad rats too. Never settling down in one location for any amount of time. And living with parents, grand parents, children and wife. Guy could theoretically just sit home and sing Kumbaya, not even working. Fuck cultural/religiously instituted “family values”, nobody is there for you at the end of it all.

It’s called “CraigsList” & “Dogs” Report comment Reply martynC says: March 28, 2017 at 10:16 pm Nice article but a little too brief. Long time taobao user (I live in Hong Kong and work is Shenzhen). I buy the majority of my electronics from taobao. Prefer taobao to the Shenzhen markets which are a nightmare when you have specific things to buy. Understanding and accepting what you are buying is a major point. If you are buying something very cheap it is a fake or has fake parts. Many shops will opening admit this now, although just as many will state everything is genuine when it is obviously not. You can bargain and should do so especially when buying multiple units. You may not get cheaper prices but I often get free delivery or some small gift thrown in. A lot of shops give repeat customer discounts (you need to be pushy). I have a few favorite shops and get extra discount from them now. Many shops don’t know about the product they are selling, especially electronics. If you need to confirm specs or want additional information, taobao is probably not the place for you. It is great of you know exactly what you want though. Customer care has come a long way in the last couple of years and most shops now offer some kind of guarantee or refund (not the same level as in the west), the buyer will need to cover any courier fee though. As the main article implies, sellers are very concerned about their rating and will often give this priority over other things. A short while ago they tightened up the accounts system and I am not sure if you can open an account from outside the intended markets. My wife uses an account from Hong Kong and we had a lot of hassle when they changed the system (it didn’t help that she lost her password either). We ended up opening a new mainland bank account just for her taobao addiction. Report comment Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Under the staircase, or in your office, where the phone line is. While it tries to cover your entire house, it has to fight walls (thick and thin), objects and floors. Most of the time, it doesn’t make it. And you end up with spotty coverage in your upstairs bedroom, cursing YouTube because it keeps buffering. Mesh Wi-Fi systems want to put an end to this horror. What Is Mesh Wi-Fi? Mesh routers take care of spotty coverage by adding more muscle and smarts. Instead of one router, you have multiple units (satellites, as they’re usually referred to), spread across your house. They all talk to each other, forming an interconnected network — a mesh network. You might have heard about mesh networking when the app Firechat first broke through into our collective conscious. The app lets users chat without the internet. At the time, it felt like magic. The app was using smartphone radios to create a device-to-device network. This is similar to what AirDrop does AirDrop Not Working? Troubleshoot Your File Transfer Woes AirDrop Not Working?

FireChat did this for millions of users and what you had at the end was a major area covered in the network. Mesh routers do the same but for your Wi-Fi routers. Reasons to Use Mesh Wi-Fi 1. Blanket Wi-Fi Everywhere Image Credit: Eero If you’ve got a large-ish or a multi-storied home, you’ll benefit from a mesh network router. Once the main device is setup, all you have to do is plug in a satellite unit and connect it to the network. Eero, for example, starts you off with three satellites and you can add up to ten satellites in the same network. Put one in your garage, and you’ll get internet access in the front lawn and your backyard. 2.

Maybe You Just Need a Better Router Image Credit: TP-Link Mesh routers come into their own when your house is larger than 1,500 square feet or multi-storied. Anything smaller than that (say a studio apartment), you’re better off with an old-fashioned single router setup. If your current router is proving troublesome even in a small area, consider upgrading to something like TP-Link Archer C7. It’s a dual-band, three-stream 802.11ac router that has amazing range and it’s under $90. A fraction of the cost of a mesh router starters kit. 2. They’re Still Quite Expensive You’ll get an awesome standalone Wi-Fi router from TP-Link or Netgear for around $100. Eero’s starter pack is $399 (three units), Google Wifi is $299 (three units), and Netgear Orbi is $399 (two units). That’s a significant cost. Worth it if spotty Wi-Fi coverage is getting in the way of your productivity. Not so much if the worst thing that happens is you lose a bar when you’re out in the backyard. 3. They’re Not Exactly Pro Tools If you’re a power user who wants complete control over their own network, including customization tools, the current crop of mesh networks aren’t for you. You’d be better off creating your own multi-device wireless system using high-end routers and repeaters. While mesh routers are faster and more reliable than single router setups, they still don’t hold a candle against a wired network solution. They usually lack a web configuration tool and rely solely on mobile apps. Image Credit: UniFi Then there’s a crop of (similarly priced) enterprise level multi-device wireless routers from Ubiquiti that the Ars Technica writers have taken a liking towards for their reliability and customization options. You connect each unit using Ethernet and they provide their own Wi-Fi coverage in their own area. So the actual internet connection isn’t traveling through three connecting devices — it’s coming straight from the Ethernet port, no matter where you are. Recommended Mesh Wi-Fi Routers eero Home WiFi System — The router that started it all is still the reviewer’s darling. The entire setup and user experience is thoughtfully designed, it’s extensible and the networking is reliable. Google Wifi — Google Wifi is similar to Eero and a bit cheaper. The satellites are quite small and fashionable enough that you won’t mind having them up on display in your living room. If you’re all into Google’s ecosystem, it makes sense to go with Google Wifi. In future, it’s bound to receive features that will make it work better with Android, Chromecast, and Google Home. Orbi Home WiFi System — Netgear Orbi is not as sexy as Eero or Google Wifi and its starter kit only comes with two satellites. But what’s interesting about Orbi is its tri-band system. Other than the two frequencies for internet access, it has another that’s just for the mesh network. Which means that while Orbi satellites are talking to each other, strengthening your Wi-Fi system, it’s not actually taking away from available internet bandwidth. Mesh Wi-Fi is big on potential, as well as internet coverage. Mesh offers a realistic Wi-Fi solution for large houses, and while the initial outlay is somewhat eye-watering, it represents a good choice for basic and advanced users.

Since it was then back ordered, I purchased a two unit Luma system. Had some issues at first, but their support was very patient and overnighted me a replacement for one Luma that would not take a firmware update. Now I'm very happy with the performance and ease of use. The slowest corner of my two story house is 400 mbps. This was a corner that had no coverage before Luma. Now there is no way I would give Luma up. Reply Timothy Buck March 28, 2017 at 10:55 pm If you're considering mesh wifi for home, I urge you to consider Plume (www.plumewifi.com). Their approach is to scatter sleek little (and I do mean little - they look like night lights) wifi "pods" to every room in your house (6 pods come with the system - that's all you need for most houses). In their "Adaptive Wifi" system, all the pods communicate with one another to balance the signal where it's needed. And it JUST WORKS - my home is quite a wifi challenge, with construction ranging from classic frame to 16-inch thick adobe walls covered in wire mesh (a virtual Faraday cage) and plaster, in an odd layout. No other wifi system I've tried has been able to provide consistent, reliable coverage like Plume. I'm not a Plume employee, nor did they pay me for this comment, I'm just a satisfied customer! Reply Antonio J Blanca March 29, 2017 at 12:59 am I agree. My house is a 2 story, 2,000 square foot structure with solid concrete roof and floors, and CBS interior partitions (no drywall). Doors are aluminum and glass. Plume just works and I have coverage in every nook and cranny and customer support is off the charts excellent. I had a Luma system that doesn't hold a candle to Plume. Gave the Luma to my daughter's in-laws. Reply Khamosh Pathak 25 articles Khamosh Pathak is a user defender, technology writer, and a UX designer.

Free land in OpenSim VR Headsets VR QR Codes Columns / VR & AR 0  Print This Post   •    Email This Post   •   App lets you configure your VR viewer by David Kariuki · March 28, 2017 Google Cardboard-compatible viewers are a great choice for people who want to experience VR but don’t want to shell out the hundreds of dollars that the big-name headsets cost. In fact, these viewers can start at just $5, and are pretty good for watching VR videos and playing casual games. Plus, they work on most late-model smartphone, so you don’t need a new computer or lots of wires. Check out our list of 10 best VR viewers under $100 and 10 super-cheap viewers for trying out VR. However, one big problem with many of these viewers is that the smartphone has to know what lenses the viewer has, and how they’re positioned. Since the viewers are dumb — they’re just lenses in a plastic or cardboard case — you normally do this by scanning a Google Cardboard QR Code. And many manufacturers don’t provide that QR Code. Maybe they’re lazy, or maybe they want you to just use their app, and not any of the thousands of other VR apps in the app stores. This is what a Google Cardboard QR Code looks like. Note the outline of a VR viewer in the center. Whatever the reason, this is a big headache. We have a list of QR Codes here, but we don’t have a QR Code for every single headset out there. Plus, new ones keep popping up all the time. What to do? You can randomly try other codes to see if they’re close enough. Or you can use Google’s own QR Code generator, though it’s a little tricky. But now, there’s a new, easier option. Sites in VR is a virtual tourism app, but it also comes with its own QR Code generator. I tried it out, and found it relatively easy to use and quick to configure my own VR viewer, Play VR. It wasn’t instant and automatic. It took about ten minutes total, and I had to customize the inner and outer distortion, field of view, chromatic aberration, lens separation distance, screen to lens distance, and the interpupil distance. But once I was done, I had the perfect QR Code for my headset. I configured the PlayVR viewer using the Sites in VR application. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) Plus, the app already comes with a selection of ready-to-go QR Codes, in case your viewer is  the official Google Cardboard headset, or a Daydream View, SmartVR, Virtual Vizor,  Homido, Homido Mini, Dscvr,VR Fold, Wearality Sky, Vrizzmo Revolt, Mattel View-Master VR, Merge VR, Durovis Dive 5, ColorCross VR, Soyan, Geeach, Gear VR, Cardboard V2, Bobo VR Z4, Ant VR, Baofeng Small Mojing, Baofeng Storm II, VR Box, Leap-HD or Ritech 3D. (And even if your viewer isn’t one of those, sometimes one of the other QR Codes works well enough, anyway.) How to create your own custom QR Code with the app If your viewer isn’t on their list, and you want to create your own QR Code from scratch, start by downloading the app for free on the Apple or Android app store. Then touch the little icon of a viewer, then on the “viewer settings” icon.   Now you should be at a screen that lets you adjust all the techie configuration settings for your customer viewer. That includes the distortion, field of view, lens separation distance and the interpupil distance. You can also use this to modify the settings for a QR Code that was provided by the manufacturer, but doesn’t look right to you because either the manufacturer made a mistake, or it doesn’t work with your particular smartphone for some reason, or if you have weird eyes. The custom viewer settings screen of the Sites in VR app.   I tried out the process of adjusting for field of view and other features, following the online instructions. I recommend starting with the ruler setting. This allows you to set the screen size. You will need to go and find an actual ruler for this one. If you don’t have a ruler, you can set it for your phone’s official screen size, but be warned that the official specs might not be exact, and, as a result, the virtual reality view that you get might be slightly off. This is the ruler calibration screen. Put an actual ruler on top of your phone, and use the arrows until the the screen’s rulers match your own. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) For all the other settings, your phone will switch to a virtual reality view. To calibrate those settings properly, put the phone inside your virtual reality headset, then move your head until the picture looks right. Then hold your head still for a couple of seconds to save — you will see a little indicator, a circle filling, that will show you that it’s saving. Customizing for inner distortion. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.)     When at the main settings menu, go to a new setting by looking in the direction of the icon — a little blue circle will appear to help you with the selection — and pause until it activates. Then you go back to the viewer settings screen, but this time in virtual reality mode, so you can configure the other settings without taking your phone out of the headset. Here is the custom viewer settings screen in virtual reality, side-by-side view. You can see the little blue circle that is the selection cursor floating just above the “Field of View” settings button. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) It seems to switch into that mode automatically — if you need to switch back out to the regular phone view, take the phone out of the viewer, touch the screen, then touch the little cardboard viewer icon at the bottom of the screen. To go back to the virtual reality mode, just select any calibration setting again. Now you can work your way through all the other settings. Adjusting the lens separation distance. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) The lens separation distance is how far your viewer’s lenses are from one another. Again, tilt your head up and down until the picture looks good to you, then pause to save. Normally, if you were creating a custom viewer code manually with the official Google viewer profile generator tool, you would need an actual ruler or calipers to measure this. So the Sites in VR app is a big time saver here. Adjusting for screen to lens distance. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) All in all, it took me about ten minutes to get through everything and create a working viewer profile. To see whether you’re done, click on the “Test View” button and you can see a little preview of what it all looks together once it’s put together. To go back to your settings selection screen, look for the little gray circle with a square inside of it — that’s the “back” button in this app — and look at it to activate it. The Test Room screen of the Sites in VR app. Once you’re all set, you can go try out your new custom viewer settings in another VR app. Once you’ve set up your custom viewer, your phone will remember it until you change it. You can also check out the rest of Sites in VR app itself, since the main purpose of this app is virtual tourism. The viewer calibration feature is just an added bonus. Select the destinations according to country, city or desired group of attractions such as nature or museums. (Image courtesy David Kariuki.) Sites in VR has about 1,700 tourism destinations from around the world, grouped by country, city or type of destination. Bursa New Thermal Spring bath in Turkey.

As some of the world's largest advertisers pull spending from Google's YouTube video-sharing site amid concerns about placement with potentially offensive material, Twitter is touting that its Periscope ads will be placed predictably and only with high-quality publishers that the marketers choose. ``They'll be able to scale and have complete control about where their message appears on live content on Twitter,'' Matt Derella, Twitter's vice president of global revenue, said in an interview. ``Brands can control and choose the trusted content they want to align their message with.'' It's a difficult promise to make about live content. Periscope users have posted live feeds of violent protests and crimes, for example. The social-media company has a program to work directly with certain publishers, such as media organizations and influencers. When advertising starts on Periscope in the coming weeks, initially on a trial basis, Twitter will share the revenue with those top-tier creators. The ads will play before the videos start rolling. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Twitter is struggling to win market share in a digital-ad market dominated by Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google. It may have an opportunity in video as YouTube works to repair relationships with advertisers that saw their commercials play alongside offensive, racist or extremist content. YouTube had been matching ads to videos automatically, as opposed to letting marketers pick the pairings -- a tactic that allowed the site's ad business to grow quickly but now has the company scrambling for technical solutions. Periscope's progress will be slower, with an invitation-only trial to start, Derella said. Twitter wouldn't say how much of the video on its site comes from its Periscope tool -- only that many millions of hours of Periscope are watched every month. The company is betting on video advertising to help boost its sales, which have slowed in recent quarters and are expected to post their first annual decline this year.

Study: PPC cannot accurately identify winning organic titles Contributor Brian Wood from Wayfair.com shares data which suggests that title tags that perform well in paid search don't necessarily indicate winning SEO titles. Brian Wood on March 28, 2017 at 10:37 am More Title tags are a meaningful on-page ranking factor and are among the most influential factors in determining click-through rate (CTR) from search engine results pages. Higher CTR not only drives more traffic immediately, it also improves organic rankings when combined with good on-site metrics. Title tag CTR is also difficult to test: it requires a large number of pages that drive a lot of organic visits, and a pretty big chunk of time — usually around two months to give Google time to index all the pages in the test and then collect enough data to have statistically significant results. A tempting alternative is to use PPC ads to get quick answers about what title tag is best. Unfortunately, testing at Wayfair.com shows that PPC ads are not always an accurate measure of what titles will perform well in the organic results. The reason is that users who click on paid ads are not a random sample of searchers; they are a biased group. We know they behave differently from overall searchers because they are in the minority of users who click on ads. And it turns out they respond differently to titles than users who click on organic results — specifically, it appears that promotional messaging (“on sale,” “discount,” “free shipping,” “50% off”) performs far better in paid ads than it does in organic results. Titles that performed best in ads often drove organic users away. Testing shows that PPC ads are not always an accurate measure of what titles will perform well in the organic results. Three title testing methods The Wayfair SEO team wanted to know if there was a faster way of testing title tag variations that gave accurate answers, so we tested a list of 10 different title tag formulas in three different ways: Mechanical Turk surveys Google PPC ads Live SEO test Each test used the same 10 title tag variations (except the Mechanical Turk test, which had only seven) and the same control title tag, and the tests ran separately over a three-month period in the summer. Here is the methodology and findings of our tests. Mechanical Turk We used the Mechanical Turk & SERP Turkey method. We tested our title tag variants with two different keywords, and tested them in the #1 position and the #3 position. Our goal was to get 1,000 clicks in each bucket: not large enough to detect very small changes in CTR, but that was fine, because we were looking only for meaningful wins. This test took about a month. It’s worth noting that it was difficult to get enough survey completions through Mechanical Turk, and we had to pare down our list of title variations to seven so we could get sufficient clicks in each bucket. A meaningful negative of Mechanical Turk is the fairly limited number of title variations that can be tested at once. Interestingly, the results of this test were actually different based on what position the title tag was ranked: In the #1 position, promotional language title tags performed best. The eventual winner of the live SEO test also did well in position #1, but not as well as promotional language. In position #3, the promotional language titles outperformed the control, but the eventual winner of the live SEO test did best of all. SERP Turkey pages — basically mockups of search engine results pages (SERPs) that you build yourself — do not include any paid ads above the results, and my hypothesis is the users who might have clicked on those ads are instead clicking on the organic results (particularly the ones at the top), and we’re seeing that paid click behavior in the organic results. This biased the #1 ranking position greatly and had a smaller bias on rankings farther down the page. Ultimately, I think SERP Turkey would be a much more valuable platform for this kind of testing if we could also insert fake ads into the fake SERPs, to draw those users out of our test data. That said, this method — using the #3 ranking position and not #1 — correctly predicted the winning title tag; however, it also measured some title tags as performing significantly better than control that actually lost in the live SEO test. PPC ads The PPC testing was by far the easiest and fastest way to get results — we had strong results in under a week. We tested our list of 10 variants on a few dozen different keywords, including the same keywords targeted in the SERP Turkey test, with the same control. We ensured only the first line changed between variants and keywords, and over-bid to guarantee visibility. Unfortunately, the results did not correctly predict the winning title tag — instead, they gave victory to losing title tags. Of note: Promotional language title tags did very well in the PPC tests. The eventual live SEO winner also outperformed the control in the PPC test, but did worse than promotional language. It seemed very clear that users who click on paid results are positively influenced by promotional (“hot deals,” “buy it now” and “save save save”) language. There did appear to be some other discrepancies with the live SEO test that were harder to explain, other than to say what’s good for a paid ad title isn’t necessarily good for an organic title, and vice versa. Live SEO test The live SEO test is the tried-and-true method we were trying to replace. The test took about two months to run (30 days for everything to get indexed, then another three weeks to collect visit data). We took a large number of product listing pages in similar furniture categories, generally ranking on the first page, and randomly distributed 2,000 URLs each into groups for the variants and a control group. We used the same control and variants as the PPC test, and all of the SERPs associated with the pages had ads present (usually three). Almost all also had the Google Shopping block. As an example, the groups might look something like this: Control: “[category name]” Variation 1: “[category name] — Free Shipping” Variation 2: “Shop All [category name]” Variation 3: “Find the Best [category name]” Variation 4: “[category name] as Low As $xx” Variation 5: “Find Your [category name]” Each variant was tested on 2,000 pages, and each 2,000-page group received over 100,000 organic visits each week. We measured the change in organic visits to the test pages vs. the control pages to see how the groups performed, and also spot-checked CTR changes in the Search Console, though these numbers are only relevant for terms with large search volume. This method remains the best way we’ve found of testing title (or meta description) changes. We saw that groups with promotional language in the title tag all performed worse than the control — sometimes substantially worse. We also saw winners, including some that also did well in the PPC and Mechanical Turk tests. Takeaways In our testing, paid ads did not consistently identify winning organic title tags. While trying to improve your title tags is definitely a very smart SEO play, relying on PPC might end up steering you wrong. PPC was able to identify some winners, but also mislabeled losers as winners, particularly when it came to promotional language. Mechanical Turk fared similar to PPC ads, particularly in the #1 ranking position. I hypothesize that you really need a test set with top ads in them for an effective test. The number of variants you can test is fairly limited due to the lack of huge numbers of people on Mechanical Turk, and it still took a pretty long time to generate results. Mechanical Turk is probably only a viable testing platform for sites that don’t have enough search traffic to their pages to do an on-site test. Neither method mislabeled winners as losers. If it did badly in either Mechanical Turk or PPC, it also did badly in organic, so using PPC ads or Mechanical Turk can be a good way to at least weed out very bad title variants. But ultimately, neither was a replacement for actual live SEO testing on high-traffic pages. A winning formula One piece of general title advice I can give after several rounds of testing over the years is this: It is incredibly difficult to find an e-commerce title tag better than a simple “[category name] | [site]” formula. So “Mustache Wax | Rand’s ‘Stache” is almost always a winner. Some opinions expressed in this article may be those of a guest author and not necessarily Search Engine Land.

While there have been many rumors of the impending demise of Google’s social network it’s still around. Google has now removed a feature the social network that has been a part of it for a few years. The Google+ location sharing feature is no longer available to users. The location sharing feature allowed Google+ users to share their location with anyone for as long as they want. The feature was launched a couple of years ago for Google+ but it has now been removed and with good reason. Google has decided to bring the location sharing feature to Google Maps, the app in which this feature would have made more sense from the get-go, allowing Maps users to share their location with friends either for a limited time or indefinitely. Google has now confirmed that the location sharing feature is being rolled out for Maps users and will soon go live for all users worldwide. It has thus disabled the feature on Google+. Users who head over to the Locations tab in Google+ to find this feature are now being told to take advantage of it in Google Maps as it should have been from the start. Filed in Web.

Elyse Betters28 March 2017Gadgets Google Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google introduced Google Wifi in the US at the end of 2016 and now its own broadband router is coming to the UK. It's a bit different to many other routers in that it can pair with other Google Wifi routers around the home to make a mesh network and therefore ensure better wireless internet connectivity. In addition, each base station looks like a Scandinavian-style, double-stacked hockey puck that Google described as a "visually subtle" disk. It's a far cry from the usual router brick. Here's everything you need to know about Google Wifi, including when and where you can buy it. What is Google Wifi? Google describes Google Wifi as a "Wi-Fi system that beams a powerful signal throughout your home". It is designed to be expandable, so you can use several of them in your home. It can also handle multiple devices, meaning you can stream in the living room and kitchen while someone games in the basement - and there should be no Wi-Fi congestion or a contest for bandwidth. How does the Google Wifi mesh network work? You basically put several of these routers (aka points) around your home to boost your network. You will get Wi-Fi signal everywhere, from your bathroom to your basement. Think of Google Wifi as an expandable system for better coverage. Instead of one router, multiple routers work together to deliver fast input throughout your home. It essentially offers mesh network-like coverage so avoids black spots in your connectivity. How many Google Wifi routers do you need? If you have a smaller home (up to 1,500 square feet), Google recommended that you start with a single Google Wifi router. You can add more points if you need more coverage. Google is offering a three-pack set that covers up to 4,500 square feet. What else can Google Wifi do? Google Wifi has a feature called Network Assist that allows it to actively manage and optimise your network behind the scenes so you don't have to adjust settings. Google Wifi handles networking automatically, picking channels, etc., and it keeps the signal strong in every corner of your house by transitioning your device to the best router for less congestion and better speed. Does Google Wifi come with an app? Yes. Although Google Wifi can optimise service without your input, you can still control it through a companion app. You can even manage several features, including the Wi-Fi access of your kids. As Google said, "You don't have to shut down the router, just go to the app and hit pause." When will Google Wifi be available? Google Wifi bundles available in the US through Google Store, Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. It will also launch in the UK on 6 April, also through the Google Store, where you can currently join a waiting list. How much is Google Wifi? Google Wifi costs $129 in the States for one base station or $299 for three. UK pricing starts at £129 for the one Google Wifi base station. A pack of two will cost £229.

How to get started with the Google Assistant on your Android phone Video Three things HTC got right in the U Ultra The AI battle on our Android phones is getting serious. After Google added Assistant to millions of handsets running Marshmallow and Nougat, Amazon followed by adding Alexa to the Mate 9. And now Microsoft is looking to enhance its new position on the lock screen. Microsoft added Cortana to the Android lock screen earlier this month, but it was little more than a feed of information with news, calendar appointments, and weather. With the latest update, Cortana on the lock screen has been enhanced to allow lock-screen interactions, giving Google Assistant a serious run for its money. The feature, which can be enabled inside the Cortana app, adds a familiar circle to your lock screen that can be swiped to the right to see your Google Now-style series of cards. At the bottom of that screen you’ll also see a new microphone icon. Tap it and it'll take you to a new screen where you’ll be able to ask Cortana questions just like you would in the app. Greenbot You can now talk to Cortana right on the lock screen of your Android phone. In addition to the new lock screen functionality, Microsoft has also updated the Cortana feed on Android to provide information about your upcoming schedule, commute, and reminders, as well as the ability to quickly add reminders and new calendar items to your day. Lists are also easier to access now so you can quickly manage your tasks. Cortana also plays nicer with Windows 10, syncing your reminders and letting you respond to calls and texts on your PC. The update is rolling out to the Google Play Store, but if you’re not seeing it, you can get it early by side-loading the APK from APKMirror. AI vs. AI: Suddenly our phones are getting very crowded. With Assistant and Cortana both accessible from the lock screen, and now Alexa beginning to cross over to Android, it’s going to be interesting to see how Google can fend off the infiltrators. No AI assistant is perfect, but they all have their strengths, so Google is going to need to keep teaching Assistant new tricks if it wants to keep winning the battle over our phones.

Furious 8, a.k.a. All in the Fambly, this April is conspicuously blockbuster-lite. (Unless you count Smurfs: The Lost Village, and we do not.) No better time, then, to do a bit of exploring around the indie fringes. Offbeat genre pictures are abound this month, from a sleazy revenge picture to a slippery character study/kaiju movie combo to a virtuosic opera of gunfire. Elsewhere, Tom Hanks tackles a technothriller, Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson venture into the jungle and a rock and roll fixture gets his bio-doc due. Here are the 10 movies you need to see this April. (Note: Only one of them has a chase scene involving a nuclear submarine. Feel free to guess which one.) The Assignment (Apr. 7th) Cult film director Walter Hill (The Warriors) has long since passed the point of giving a damn what people think, and the premise of his latest scuzzy genre flick has already raised plenty of eyebrows. Michelle Rodriguez plays a hitman-turned-hitwoman on a revenge rampage in search of – wait for it – the surgeon who tampered with her genitals. If you need some sick pulp kicks, rusty-razor-blade dialogue and a DGAF performance from Sigourney Weaver as the Poe-quoting mad doctor, and we've got a trashterpiece that proud Z-movie bottomfeeders will suck right up. The Circle (Apr. 28th) Mae (Emma Watson) thinks she's hit the jackpot when she lands a prestigious job at a powerful Internet company named the Circle. The Google-ish-but-definitely-not-Google-per-the-movie's-lawyers job seems too good to be true, and as with most tech startups, it is; cue some ethically cloudy practices going on in the corporation's closed-circuit monitoring operations. The company's outwardly benevolent but unsettling founder (Tom Hanks) doesn't look too kindly on whistleblowers. Soon, the corporation's whole "total virtual omnipresence" thing turns out to be just as sinister as you'd think. John Boyega, Ellar Coltrane, Karen Gillan, and Patton Oswalt round out the cast. And Google, if you're listening – we love you. Colossal (Apr. 7th) How to classify Nacho Vigalondo's genre-bridging new whatsit? It's one of those quarter-life-crisis coming-of-age movies, where a rudderless, metropolitan thirtysomething (in this instance, an endearingly dysfunctional Anne Hathaway) returns to her hometown to try to scrape some semblance of a life together. There's some sci-fi in there, too – she's somehow linked to a gargantuan mutant beast that terrorizes Seoul every night. And as she strikes up a complicated relationship with a good-natured bartender (Jason Sudeikis), the film pivots into a toothy commentary on codependence and masculine entitlement. Three clever, hearteningly original movies for the price of a single admission? In this economy?! The F8 of the Furious (Apr. 14th) Each new chapter of Hollywood's fastest, furiousest franchise is a contest to one-up the previous film, so the question is: How will director F. Gary Gray (Straight Outta Compton) top the multi-skyscraper centerpiece of the seventh go-round with the [cue Vin Diesel voice] fambly of high-living motorist rogues? Try a hailstorm of cars out of the windows of a high-rise, a nuclear-class submarine chase across a stretch of ice and a turn to the dark side for Diesel's hero Dom Toretto. The rest of the usual suspects launch a counteroffensive to figure out why our mumbly hero could have turned tail and teamed up with an evil geoterrorist (Charlize Theron). At this rate, it's only a matter of time until the series goes to space. Which would, of course, be fucking awesome, bro! Free Fire (Apr. 21st) In Seventies Boston, a motley crew of criminal lowlifes (a game ensemble collecting Brie Larson, Armie Hammer, and a surprisingly tolerable Sharlto Copley) converge on a warehouse to run some guns. An order gets bungled. Communication breakdown ensues – and director Ben Wheatley then turns the heat up over the next 90 minutes in a grueling, drag-down shootout. With a healthy dose of black humor to leaven the proceedings, the assembled crooks all scheme to escape with their lives, if not the cache of firearms. Jumpy viewers will have conniptions. It's that good. The Lost City of Z (Apr. 14th) James Gray (The Immigrant) returns in grand fashion with another lavishly produced historical epic, now chronicling an audacious turn-of-the-century expedition to locate a forgotten civilization deep in the Amazon rain forest. Charlie Hunnam plays the explorer fanatically pursuing his quest at the cost of his own sanity, Sienna Miller appears as his long-suffering wife; Robert Pattinson plays the right-hand man gradually losing faith in their mission. Think Apocalypse Now, returned to the colonialist setting of Conrad's original Heart of Darkness. And then add Robert Pattinson. My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea (Apr. 14th) When people talk about the treacherous terrain of high school, they're usually being metaphorical. Not so with this curious animated flick, in which unpopular sophomore Dash (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) discovers that Tides High has been built over a fault line. Of course the school is going to crack in half. He'll have to deal with the expected jealousy and crushes of any teen comedy while leading his friends (voiced by Reggie Watts, Maya Rudolph, Susan Sarandon and Lena Dunham, among others) to safety on the roof. Finally, the film finally bridges the gap between John Hughes and San Andreas. Shot! The Psycho-Spiritual Mantra of Rock (Apr. 7th) Mick Rock may have been the single most significant photographer of rock and roll during its Seventies heyday. The British invader spent David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust period as the glam-rock pioneer's personal chronicler, then went on to shoot everyone from Iggy Pop to Lou Reed to the Sex Pistols to the Ramones. This documentary recounts his wild days in the belly of the glammed-out, coked-out beast, while also finding time to touch on more personal matters – Rock's various entanglements with addiction, namely. It's an insider's view at some of music's most outsized personalities. Sleight (Apr. 28th) Orphaned and left to care for his younger sister, Bo (rising star Jacob Latimore) has no choice but to get involved with gang life to keep a roof over his head. When he has a change of heart and begins looking for a way out, his mysterious magic abilities and expertise in the subtle arts of misdirection and distraction could help him find a new life. Joining Now You See Me in the emerging "cool magicians" subgenre, this indie drama deploys its special effects tactfully for a smaller-scale superheroic spin of the usual gang-life narrative. And if nothing else, it's a step in the right direction considering the sad lack of superpowered black characters onscreen. A Quiet Passion (Apr. 14th) Sex and the City's Cynthia Nixon turns in a career-best performance as the famously tempestuous poet Emily Dickinson in this take on the moody wordsmith, but don't let the biopic trappings fool you: director and British-cinema national treasure Terence Davies (Distant Voices, Still Lives) has created a portrait of an artist that's bitchy, hysterical and wounding in equal measure. Balancing a careful consideration of Dickinson's works with a probing look into the turbulence that defined her personal life and mental state, it's both a takedown of stuffy, overly reverent heritage movies and a proper bio-genre highmark. Don't miss this.

Everything you need to know What is Google WiFi? Everything you need to know By Darren Allan Wi-Fi   What’s so great about Google’s mesh-networked cylinders? Shares Google WiFi has been out in the US since the end of last year, but as is often the case with big tech launches, other countries have had to wait. For people in the UK, that wait is almost over, as it debuts in the UK next week, on April 6 to be precise. Maybe you’ve heard about Google WiFi, and perhaps something about mesh networking, but you’re still not quite certain why you should be all that bothered about the router system. We’re here to explain exactly what’s different about Google WiFi compared to your average router, and why you should be excited concerning its imminent arrival. What is it? First of all, the basics. The idea of Google WiFi is to provide multiple devices which hook up together to ensure better wireless coverage across your home. One of the router devices – they’re all identical compact little white cylinders – connects to your DSL or cable modem as normal, and the others are strategically placed elsewhere around your home, connecting wirelessly to this first unit, and ensuring a strong Wi-Fi signal in their vicinity. In other words, you won’t just have a belting Wi-Fi signal in your living room where the primary device is. If, for example, there’s a ‘dead spot’ (poor connection) way over in the kitchen on the far side of the house, placing a Google WiFi device there will ensure great connectivity while you’re cooking up dinner, rather than a sluggish surfing experience. These linked-up cylindrical devices form what is known as a mesh network. In the UK, you’ll be able to purchase a two-pack of Google’s devices for £229, with a single Google WiFi unit costing £129. What’s so great about Google WiFi? If you’ve got a large house, you may well have problems with dead spots – perhaps upstairs is a weak connectivity nightmare. Google WiFi can eliminate these issues with a minimum of fuss, and three of the WiFi cylinders are able to cover up to 4,500 square feet (418 square metres) of your house, according to the company. One of the other big attractions here is that it’s extremely easy to set the system up, and to subsequently tinker with it. Installation is facilitated via a free Android or iOS app which takes all the pain out of the process and configures the network for you. Once you’re up and running, you can use that same app to easily tweak various settings. For instance, it’s possible to prioritise bandwidth for a specific device, so if you’re doing something intensive like playing an online game or streaming 4K video, you can give the hardware in question a leg-up. Or with just the tap of an icon, you can ‘pause’ Wi-Fi coverage, temporarily turning it off when, say, you’re sitting down for a meal at the dining table, to make sure the family is chatting together and not stuck with their noses in their respective phones or tablets. It’s also easy to test the performance of the overall Wi-Fi network, and tweak the positioning of your Google WiFi devices if coverage isn’t optimal (i.e. move one device closer to the base unit which is hooked up to your modem, to give it a better connection). There really is a focus on user-friendliness here – although note that more tech-savvy users might wish for a bit more in terms of advanced options. But they’re not who Google WiFi is aimed at. Another plus point to bear in mind is that in our review, we found Google WiFi boasted impressive performance levels when it came to real-world speeds (if you’re interested, check out the full benchmarks here). And finally, on the aesthetic front, the cylindrical devices are relatively smart-looking and unobtrusive, meaning you should be able to stash them about your house without provoking any comments about technological eyesores. Any pitfalls to be aware of? It can’t all be glowing news, right? As mentioned, it’s true that advanced users may want more configuration options than Google gives them. And the UK pricing isn’t pitched at such a tempting level as it is in the US. Over in the States, Google sells a three-pack of the devices for $299, whereas in the UK, only a two-pack is offered at £229. So if you want three devices to cover your large house, you’ll have to buy an extra single unit at £129 for a combined cost of £358 (compared to $299). That said, you may well only need a two-pack to cover your home (two should do for a medium-to-larger house, according to Google), and the system is still temptingly enough priced – it’s just not quite as compellingly cheap as it is in the US. This probably shouldn’t be a surprise, though, given that the whole Brexit vote and resulting currency fluctuations have hit the UK hard in terms of hardware prices.

The historically black university is opening Howard West at Google's headquarters in Mountain View. Howard University hide caption toggle caption Howard University Students at Howard University in Washington, D.C. The historically black university is opening Howard West at Google's headquarters in Mountain View. Howard University It's clear from the numbers. Google has a diversity problem. For the past few years, the company has publicly shared its workplace makeup in a report detailing the race, gender and ethnicity of each employee hired the previous year. Last year, while the number of black employees went up, they still represented only 2 percent of the company's workforce and Google admitted it fell short of its diversity goal. In one small step to grow those numbers, this summer 25 students from Howard University, the historically black university based in Washington, D.C., will train at the tech giant's headquarters in Mountain View, Caif. With Howard West, as it's being called, Google believes it can meet that goal faster, says Bonita Stewart, the company's vice president of global partnerships. "We have the opportunity to be able to build a qualified pipeline of talent across the black community," she says. NPR Ed A High School's Lesson For Helping English Language Learners Get To College The pipeline, or the pipeline problem, is an idea commonly held in Silicon Valley that there just aren't enough blacks, Latinos and women with computer programming skills to fill jobs. The 25 students at Howard West will be mentored by Google engineers and get regular classroom instruction from Howard professors. Howard and Google plan to train 750 students over five years and will open the program to students from all historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. Wayne A.I. Frederick, Howard's president, says this is an important step, "but I think just as important, will be exposure to the culture here." Frederick heard from alums working in the industry, who said they felt Howard prepared them technically, but not culturally, to work in Silicon Valley. There's the management style, which values collaboration over hierarchy, the importance of networking and, of course, how to dress. "So, for instance, I'm dressed in a suit and tie, and I haven't seen anybody else in a suit and a tie," he says, jokingly. "So that's one example to just being exposed to that culture." Christian Simamora, of Code2040, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing the number of blacks and Latinos in the tech sector, applauds the opening of Howard West. He's concerned, though, that the narrative will become, "there's a pipeline problem," he says. NPR Ed Can Schools Solve The Tech Industry's Pipeline Problem? "We would hire more black engineers if we could find them," Simamora says, mimicking a common refrain from tech companies. "The fact of the matter is the talent is there." Simamora points out that about 18 percent of computer science majors in the U.S. identify as black or Latino, but they represent only 5 percent of the technology workforce. He says the problem is with recruitment. "Many of the top tech companies aren't even recruiting at the HBCUs — Howard, Spelman. All these schools have CS programs." So why aren't big tech companies recruiting at HBCUs? "I can't speak for those companies," he says. "But what I find interesting is that tech disrupts; tech hiring does not disrupt. It does not question what came before it." Simamora says many tech companies continue to focus their recruitment efforts at a few schools, like Stanford, Harvard and MIT - the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Considering that, Simamora says the opening of Howard West at Google is disruptive and might force the tech industry to start acting differently. black engineers tech companies Howard University tech industry Silicon Valley hbcu Google Facebook Twitter Google+ Email nprEd HOW LEARNING HAPPENS nprEd HOW LEARNING HAPPENS About We've been to school.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Home and Google WiFi land in UK next month Eric Abent - Mar 28, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Here in the US, we’ve been able to enjoy the benefits of Google Home and Google WiFi for a few months now, but our friends over in the UK haven’t had the same opportunity. That’s all about to change next month, as Google has announced that both devices will be making their way across the Atlantic at the beginning of April. Google Home, as you may already know, serves in part as a vehicle for Google Assistant. Similar to Amazon’s Echo line of devices, which connect you to Alexa, Google Home allows you to rely on Google Assistant for a number of different tasks. For instance, you can use Google Home to ask about the current weather or get the day’s news headlines from sources like the BBC or The Guardian. You can also use Google Home to play your music through the device’s built in speaker. It can serve as the center of your connected home as well, letting you control your lights, climate systems, or lock the doors automatically through voice commands. Google WiFi, on the other hand, is a router system that aims to make your WiFi signal more consistent throughout your entire home. Instead of providing WiFi through a single device, Google Home routers can be spread throughout your house to create a mesh network, creating better WiFi coverage in every room. Both devices will be launching in the UK on April 6. Google Home will set you back £129 while Google WiFi is available for the same price or in a double pack for £229. Both will be available at a number of retailers, including Dixons, Argos, Maplin, and John Lewis, or through the Google Store online.

Similar to Amazon's Echo speaker , the Home is a voice-controlled "smart speaker" with the Google Assistant built in. You can ask it to read the news, play some music or answer any question with a Google search. The speaker has been on sale in the US since November but Google announced this week it'll land in the UK on April 6th at a cost of £129. That's £20 less than the Amazon Echo. Read More Google's answer to the Amazon Echo smart speaker finally gets UK release date We tried out the speaker at a launch event in London this week and early impressions are good. The speaker will work best if you already have other so-called Internet of Things (IoT) devices in your house. If, for example, you have a Chromecast plugged into the TV and a Netflix subscription, you can order Google Home to start playing your current series. Design Short and squat when compared to the Echo, the Google Home speaker is designed to effectively blend into your home decor. It's unassuming and about as minimalist as you can get. Read More Revealed: The secret Chrome and Google Search tricks that'll make your browser even more powerful (Photo: Jeff Parsons) The sloping top of the device is touch-sensitive and you can roll your finger around it to raise or lower the volume. A swift tap on the top will turn it on and off. Four lights in Google colours: red, blue, yellow and green will indicate when it's listening to you and processing a command. There's only one button on the entire device and that's a mute option for the microphone if you don't want the speaker listening out for the "Hey, Google" command. Read More Google Home coming to the UK to take on Amazon's all-conquering Echo speaker (Photo: Jeff Parsons) (Photo: Jeff Parsons) The bottom grille actually comes away from the speaker and Google is offering a range of different colours to choose from. So you can set up and personalise the little gadget to work with different rooms. Features At the very least, Google Home is an adequate voice-controlled speaker. If you've got a Spotify or Google Music subscription, then you can ask it to play a particular song or playlist. The volume and quality is enough to fill a small-to-medium sized room, but it won't replace a fully-functional hi-fi setup. Read More Anything Apple can do...Google reveals stunning images of its sprawling 'Green Loop' campus (Photo: Jeff Parsons) But that barely scratches the surface of what it can do. Google has engineered it to work with other devices (Chromecast, Nest thermostats, Philips Hue light bulbs) so that it can be the voice-controlled hub of your house. We're not quite at the level of JARVIS from Iron Man , but theoretically you can march into your house and have it dim the lights, turn the temperature up and cue up Netflix with a few barks at the speaker. Google Assistant The Google Assistant is the ace-in-the-hole for the Home speaker. It taps the superior power of Google's search engine, allowing you to ask more complex questions in a more natural way. You can also ask follow-up questions, so it feels more like a conversation. Read More Artificial intelligence can spot early signs of skin cancer just as well as a trained doctor Google Assistant running on a smartphone An example would be: “Where is the nearest petrol station?” and then a follow up with: “When does it close?” Moreover, the Assistant on Google Home is the same as the Assistant built into Android smartphones, so data can be shared across both devices. Should I buy it? Internet-connected devices are becoming more and more popular in our homes and Google is clearly aware of this. If you're happy to go all-in then Google's Home speaker is definitely the place to start. Read More Get ready to start talking to your car, your TV and your fridge - Amazon Alexa steals the show at CES 2017 (Photo: Jeff Parsons) It's cheaper than Amazon's alternative and we'd certainly recommend it if you've already got a Chromecast or Chromecast Audio. Of course, if you're using a Fire TV Stick it makes sense to stick with Amazon. Of course, Google is going to refine and update this technology as it improves, so there's no harm in sitting back and seeing how it plays out before you decide to make a purchase.

The search giant is finally bringing its voice-activated smart speaker to UK, and it will be available from April 6 at the price of GBP 129 (roughly Rs. 10,500). The search giant has also launched Google Wifi in the UK, its mesh Wi-Fi solution. It will be launched on the same day as Google Home in UK and the pricing for the router will start from GBP 129 as well. The California-based company's Google Assistant-powered speaker will be made available in UK at Argos, Dixons, John Lewis, and Maplin from April 6 and is said to be coming soon to EE as well. The coloured bases will be made available for GBP 18 (roughly Rs. 1,500) for fabric and GBP 36 (roughly Rs. 2,900) for metal on the Google Store, Google said in its official blog. While users will be able to get Google Wifi 1-pack for GBP 129, they will have to shell out GBP 229 (Rs. 18,700) in a Google store for a 2-pack. Google Wifi will also be made available from Dixons, Argos, Maplin and John Lewis and will be coming soon to Amazon, as per Google. With Google Home speaker, users can get answers to their queries and can also perform various tasks using just their voice. The voice-activated speaker can help users with calculations as well as translations and bring them news from publications such as BBC, The Guardian, The Sun etc. "Using the Google Assistant, Google Home can answer questions about your interests, the weather, traffic, sports, finance, local businesses and more. You could ask "Where is the nearest petrol station?" and then follow up with,"When does it close?" The Assistant can also have fun - it can tell you jokes, play trivia or make animal sounds," Google said in its blog. Users can further ask the smart speaker to play songs using services such as Spotify and Google Music. Coming to the Google Wifi, it uses mesh Wi-Fi technology and aims to solve the problem with traditional routers that have usually not been built to support increasing number of devices with activities that use high bandwidth, Google says. "Google Wifi is a connected system that replaces your current router to bring smarts, security and simplicity to home Wi-Fi to give you consistently strong coverage in your home," it said. Google Wifi comes with its own app that even allows users to stop Wi-Fi access to certain devices. Interestingly, UK has become the first country after the US to get Google Home speaker. The search giant seems to be following the same marketing strategy as its rival Amazon, which introduced its Echo speaker in the UK after launching in the US initially. As the Amazon Echo retails for around GBP 150 (roughly Rs. 12,200), Google seems to have a pricing advantage over its competitor speaker.

Image: Charles McLellan/ZDNet Google has launched its Google Home smart speaker and Google Wifi wireless router in the UK. Both products have been on sale in the US since late last year. Amazon Echo review: Alexa is the first digital assistant that is actually helpful You may not think you need a voice-activated speaker and a cloud-powered digital assistant in your home, but Amazon's Echo and Alexa may persuade you otherwise. Read More The Google Assistant-powered Home is Google's answer to Amazon's Alexa-driven Echo and Echo Dot. With the distinctly utilitarian wake-phrase 'OK Google', the £129 smart speaker will give voice-driven access to Google services like Search, Maps and Translate. You can access media such as Google Play Music, Spotify, TuneIn and BBC Radio, playing music either on the Google Home device itself or on other connected speakers around the house, and send video to a Chromecast-connected TV. You can also create and query information in your Google calendar, set timers and alarms, and create to-do lists. Other compatible smart home devices from Nest, Philips and Samsung Smartthings can be controlled via Google Home too. Google Home will be available on 6 April from the Google Store, at £129. It will also be on sale at Argos, Dixons, John Lewis and Maplin, and (soon) EE. The Google Store will sell you coloured bases for £18 (fabric) or £36 (metal). Google Wifi comes in single units or as a 2-pack for mesh networking. Image: Charles McLellan/ZDNet Google Wifi Google Wifi is a puck-shaped 802.11ac router that plugs into your broadband connection and can create a mesh network delivering whole-home internet coverage. You can buy Google Wifi in single units (suitable for a small home) or as a two-pack system. Google Wifi will also be available on 6 April, costing £129 (1-pack) or £229 (2-pack) at the Google Store. Argos, Dixons, John Lewis, and Maplin will also sell the router, as will Amazon. According to Google, there are a few 'British treats' secreted in the UK version of Google Home, which ZDNet looks forward to discovering when review units become available.

News Technology Google Home set to launch in UK next month Tom Powell Tuesday 28 March 2017 14:01 BST Click to follow The Evening Standard Google Home: the device can control lights, play music and answer queries PA Google is launching a voice-controlled device which can switch off lights, play music and answer questions in the UK this April. Google Home can search online, use maps and translate in order to answer queries and even ask follow-up questions. The speaker, released in the US last year, uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to understand context and answer follow-up questions to initial voice commands. Suveer Kothari, director of product planning at Google, said: "With your permission, Google Home can assist you in planning your day, based on information like your calendar entries or flight information from your Google account. "But if you'd rather keep things to yourself, you can turn off personal results any time in the Google Home app with a single swipe." Artificially intelligent voice assistants have become increasingly popular products among technology firms, with Samsung announcing its own take on the subject, Bixby, last week to rival Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana and Apple's Siri, which are already in use.

Home will cost £129 and will be available in a range of colours, Google said. The tech giant also announced it was launching its Wifi router - Google Wifi - in the UK. The device, which will also cost £129, uses technology called mesh Wifi, which Google says uses multiple routers to evenly spread internet signal throughout the home.

From April 6, Google Wi-Fi will go on sale and will cost £129 for one device, with packs of two costing £229. ADVERTISEMENT Google Home is coming to the UK on April 6 for £129 Google Home is coming to the UK on April 6 for £129 Google 1 day ago At the product's UK launch at a press event in London Suveer Kothari, director of product and partnerships at Google Home, said the device is meant to make Wi-Fi available "like a sprinkler system rather than a firehose". READ NEXT Google Home is coming to the UK on April 6 for £129 Google Home is coming to the UK on April 6 for £129 By Matt Burgess To do this, it has been created to use mesh networking Wi-Fi. The protocol works by spreading out the wireless connection across a number of devices to create a wider coverage pattern. A Google Wi-Fi unit is able to connect to other Google Wi-Fi devices and increase the wireless broadcasting range across the space it is placed in. Subscribe to WIRED The Google router itself is a small cylinder that does not look like a traditional Wi-Fi access point. The firm, which originally launched the product in the US in 2016, has attempted to design the router so that it will blend in with furniture and accessories in the home. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Android Wear 2.0 is coming to more smartwatches from Hugo Boss, Diesel and Movado Android Wear 2.0 is coming to more smartwatches from Hugo Boss, Diesel and Movado By Amelia Heathman Google Google claims the device gives "consistently strong coverage" across a space. "Traditionally Wi-Fi routers haven’t always been built to support the increasing number of devices we use or high bandwidth activities like gaming or watching video," it said in a blog post. The firm says for smaller homes one of its Wi-Fi points will be appropriate whereas "medium to large" homes may need two. Homes with thicker walls may need to have more access points than those with thin ones. Norton's new router aims to keep your home safe from IoT botnets Norton's new router aims to keep your home safe from IoT botnets CES 2017 03 Jan 2017 It continues to say: "Within our mesh network, each Google Wi-Fi point creates a high-powered connection, and the different Wi-Fi points work together to determine the best path for your data". ADVERTISEMENT As with almost all new product launches, Google Wi-Fi will also come with an app to control it. The app allows home-owners to see which devices are connected to each Wi-Fi point and also has parental control features built in. Within the app, it is possible to 'pause' the Wi-Fi connection for certain users. Google says it is ideal for stopping children's connections "when it’s time to come to the dinner table". The Google Wi-Fi device will be sold from the Google Store and also Dixons, Argos, Maplin, John Lewis and Amazon.

By Luke Johnson / Published 29th March 2017 DAILY STAR ONLINE ECHO RIVAL: Google has confirmed it will launch its Google Home smart speaker in the UK soon The Amazon Echo was the must-own gadget of 2016, with the smart speaker continuing its success this year with a number of new features. Despite still being a great device, however, there’s now a serious reason not to buy one. That’s because Google just launched its own rival product here in the UK. Already available in the US, the search giant has confirmed that its own smart speaker, dubbed Google Home, will go on sale in the UK in the coming days. Amazon Echo tips and tricks - things you need to ask Alexa right now Friday, 3rd February 2017 AMAZON'S Echo speaker was the surprise hit of 2016 and, if you've just bought one, here some things you need to ask Alexa. 1 / 9 DS Amazon Echo tips and tricks Having been available stateside since October, Google has revealed that the Google Home smart speaker will hit UK retailers on April 6. It will cost £129 at launch, £20 cheaper than the rival Echo. Like the Amazon Echo, however, it’s controlled by your voice. Instead of featuring Amazon’s Alexa AI at its core though, it’s built around the Android maker’s own Google Assistant platform. This lets you play music, check the weather, control connected smart home devices and even interact with your TV via a Google Chromecast, all using nothing more than your voice. Being Google, search is also key, with users able to ask questions to rooms featuring the internet-connected speaker using the ‘OK, Google’ voice command. Answers are then relayed through the speaker which has interchangeable bases to better fit with the style of your home. DAILY STAR ONLINE “This device won’t look out of place anywhere in your home, it doesn’t look like a traditional consumer device,” a Google spokesperson said at the launch. “We’ve simulated thousands of noisy environments so we can offer best in class voice recognition. “This is the perfect device to get answers and keep you involved.” If you’re worried about Google listening in to your every conversation, don’t be. Like the Echo, Google Home keeps your privacy in mind, with a mute button located on the rear of the device to cut power to the microphones. “In your home, it’s your rules and we’re really sympathetic to your privacy,” Google said. “The only physical button is a mute button.” Giving the smart speaker a nice UK flavour, Google has confirmed there will be a number of UK-specific easter eggs when it hits British shops next week. Not the only new device Google is bringing to the UK, Google Home will launch on the same day as Google Wi-Fi. A powerful, intelligent router, Google Wi-Fi gives you more control over your wireless internet connections. With daily chain style abilities, you can use one or multiple devices to connect your mass of internet-hungry gadgets and bring strong, reliable Wi-Fi to all corners of your home. What’s more, using the Google Wi-Fi app, you are able to prioritise Wi-Fi to a certain device at any time, perfect for when you’re trying to stream a movie to your TV. Also set to hit the UK on April 6, Google Wi-Fi will cost £129 as a standalone device, or £229 as a two pack.

The historically black university is opening Howard West at Google's headquarters in Mountain View. Howard University hide caption toggle caption Howard University Students at Howard University in Washington, D.C. The historically black university is opening Howard West at Google's headquarters in Mountain View. Howard University It's clear from the numbers. Google has a diversity problem. For the past few years, the company has publicly shared its workplace makeup in a report detailing the race, gender and ethnicity of each employee hired the previous year. Last year, while the number of black employees went up, they still represented only 2 percent of the company's workforce and Google admitted it fell short of its diversity goal. In one small step to grow those numbers, this summer 25 students from Howard University, the historically black university based in Washington, D.C., will train at the tech giant's headquarters in Mountain View, Caif. With Howard West, as it's being called, Google believes it can meet that goal faster, says Bonita Stewart, the company's vice president of global partnerships. "We have the opportunity to be able to build a qualified pipeline of talent across the black community," she says. NPR Ed A High School's Lesson For Helping English Language Learners Get To College The pipeline, or the pipeline problem, is an idea commonly held in Silicon Valley that there just aren't enough blacks, Latinos and women with computer programming skills to fill jobs. The 25 students at Howard West will be mentored by Google engineers and get regular classroom instruction from Howard professors. Howard and Google plan to train 750 students over five years and will open the program to students from all historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. Wayne A.I. Frederick, Howard's president, says this is an important step, "but I think just as important, will be exposure to the culture here." Frederick heard from alums working in the industry, who said they felt Howard prepared them technically, but not culturally, to work in Silicon Valley. There's the management style, which values collaboration over hierarchy, the importance of networking and, of course, how to dress. "So, for instance, I'm dressed in a suit and tie, and I haven't seen anybody else in a suit and a tie," he says, jokingly. "So that's one example to just being exposed to that culture." Christian Simamora, of Code2040, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing the number of blacks and Latinos in the tech sector, applauds the opening of Howard West. He's concerned, though, that the narrative will become, "there's a pipeline problem," he says. NPR Ed Can Schools Solve The Tech Industry's Pipeline Problem? "We would hire more black engineers if we could find them," Simamora says, mimicking a common refrain from tech companies. "The fact of the matter is the talent is there." Simamora points out that about 18 percent of computer science majors in the U.S. identify as black or Latino, but they represent only 5 percent of the technology workforce. He says the problem is with recruitment. "Many of the top tech companies aren't even recruiting at the HBCUs — Howard, Spelman. All these schools have CS programs." So why aren't big tech companies recruiting at HBCUs? "I can't speak for those companies," he says. "But what I find interesting is that tech disrupts; tech hiring does not disrupt. It does not question what came before it." Simamora says many tech companies continue to focus their recruitment efforts at a few schools, like Stanford, Harvard and MIT - the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Considering that, Simamora says the opening of Howard West at Google is disruptive and might force the tech industry to start acting differently. black engineers tech companies Howard University tech industry Silicon Valley hbcu Google Facebook Twitter Google+ Email nprEd HOW LEARNING HAPPENS nprEd HOW LEARNING HAPPENS About We've been to school.

It can sometimes take months for a product or service the company debuts in the States to make its way to other countries, especially in the case of the UK. Today, though, Google is finally bringing two US products “across the pond” ─ Google Home and Google Wifi. The best gifts for Android users These products don’t differ too much in the UK besides the plug adapters, but there are some nice tweaks for the locale. For example, Google Home in the UK can interact with publications such as the BBC, The Guardian, The Financial Times, The Sun, The Telegraph, Huffington Post, Sky News, Sky Sports, and more with the daily briefing feature. Of course, it can also answer questions about local businesses and addresses as well. Google even says that Home in the UK will be able to tune in live to BBC Radio. Along with that, Google Wifi is also making its way to the UK with the same strong mesh wifi network capabilities in tow, all designed to keep everything connected despite a massive number of devices or high bandwidth. You can learn more about both of these products in our reviews below, but if you’re interested in purchasing, both will be available in the UK starting on April 6th. Google Home will cost £129 and Google Wifi will run £129 for a single pack and £229 for the double-pack. In addition to the Google Store, Google Home will be available from Argos, Dixons, John Lewis and Maplin and coming soon to EE.

While it was once marketed as a way to secretly buy gifts or plan anniversary surprises, most users know it as a way to privately browse porn. Now Google has addressed the elephant in the room by adding a cheeky message for heavy users of its incognito mode. Scroll down for video  Google Chrome's 'Incognito mode' offers internet users a way to browse the web without fear of any activity appearing in their history. In Chrome's normal browser, after opening 100 tabs the tab counter is replaced with a smiley face, as can be seen in this image HOW TO TRIGGER THE MESSAGE  Open up Google Chrome on an Android mobile device. Open 100 or more tabs in the browser. Where a normal browser would show a smiley face, a winking face appears instead. In Chrome's normal mode, users who open up 100 or more browser tabs are shown a smiley face. The face appears instead of the tab counter in the top right hand of their browser. But after a new update, in Incognito mode this smiley face instead becomes a winking face. Chrome's new winking message only appears on the Android version of the app. In iOS versions of the browser, opening 100 Incognito tabs simply brings up a normal smiley face.

Share this article Share 43 shares For heavy users of Google's Incognito tab a winking face (pictured) pops up after opening 100 tabs, a cheeky nod to the private browser's notoriety as a platform for watching pornography in secret. The 'Easter egg' only pops up for Android users of the browser It is not known if the company intends to include the tongue-in-cheek message in its iOS browser in future. 'We're not sure why this happens, but we think it may be that the app wasn't designed to have more than two characters in the number of tabs field,' Mashable journalist Freia Lobo said. 'So instead of having three tiny characters in the field, they just switch over to smileys which have two characters.' Google Chrome is a treasure trove of hidden features and messages, known in internet slang as 'Easter Eggs'. These include an incredibly addictive video game, accessed by pressing the space bar when an internet page won't load. A dinosaur on the page will spring to life and run across the screen, users can press space bar to help him dodge obstacles.  Desktop Chrome users who search 'Google in 1998' from their browser bar are transported back in time as their search results are presented as if plugged into Google's original 90's search engine. And Chrome users who search 'Beam me up, Scotty' in Youtube will find their video results pop onto the page as if teleported from Star Trek's U.S.S. Enterprise. Chrome's new winking Easter Egg only appears on the Android version of the app. In iOS versions of the browser, opening 100 Incognito tabs simply brings up a normal smiley face (stock image) Read more: Google Chrome is definitely not judging you and your 100 incognito tabs Share or comment on this article e-mail 43 shares Most watched News videos Dead man is cut out of the stomach of a seven metre long PYTHON Shocking moment a driver is punched through his car window Monkman gets the better of Seagull in University Challenge semi-final Maid caught on camera appearing to be POSSESSED by evil spirits Brazen man catches huge COBRA out of hole with his bare hands Mother films invasive TSA pat-down of her disabled teenage son Furious cyclist smashes driver's windscreen with his own bike New ISIS video shows child soldiers hunting and killing prisoners Shocking carer steals money out of dementia patient's handbag Medics fired after mocking patient on a surgery table Miraculous moment baby who was 'buried alive' is rescued in India Driver's hilarious attempt to squeeze car through tight gap Horrifying moment villagers cut open a giant python and...

Even in 3rd world countries like Zimbabwe, it has become slightly easier for people to access smartphones, computers and the internet. TechZim recently came across a list of technologies we didn’t have a decade ago and thought it would be interesting to share some of the more locally popular technologies and devices that weren’t around in 2006: the iPhone The first generation iPhone (iPhone 2G) was announced in January 2007 and released in America on 29 June 2007.  By 2013 Apple had completely stopped supporting the device and classified it as a vintage unit. advertisement Most people in Zimbabwe never really got the chance to use this device and are more familiar with its successor the iPhone 3G (2008) which is also classified a vintage unit now. At its time of release the iPhone 2G packed a whopping 4GB storage and operated on iOS 1. Android mobile operating system The first version of the popular mobile operating system was called Android Alpha and came out in 2007, however, its first commercial release was in September 2008. The Alpha OS or Android 1.0 developed by Gooogle had a whole range of Google services running on it which included Gmail, Google contacts, Google Maps, Google Sync, Google Talk (Gtalk) and the popular Android Market (now called Play Store). Android has become arguably the most popular operating system right now largely owing to it being free, open source, ability to work on almost anything (low-end to high-end devices) and the large community of application developers that contribute to the large app store. The first commercially available smartphone running Android was the HTC Dream, released on October 22, 2008. Instagram The online photo and video sharing platform first release was back in 2010 and caused major disruption to the photography industry as everyone instantly became both a photographer and editor through the use of filters. When it first came out many professional photographers hated the idea of the public having access to filters that turned basic photos into professional looking images. Businesses have also taken advantage of the platform to share images and short video clips of their products and services communicating directly with their target market. Snapchat Snapchat is another online photo and video sharing platform with a unique twist. Its initial release was in 2011 under the name Picaboo and two months later it was changed to SnapChat. The platform allows users to share short clips or images of what they are doing to an audience of followers through “snaps” that expire after 24hrs. The Snapchat model has seen it become a hit with many teenagers and youth that other social networking platforms and copied its snap model of filters and expiring content to try and retain its followers by increasing the amount of user engagement. WhatsApp WhatsApp is by far the most popular application in Zimbabwe, helped on by the social media bundle it has become most Zimbabweans primary mode of communication and source of news. WhatsApp came out in 2009 and by 2016 it had over a billion users. In 2014 it was sold to Facebook for $19 billion in a structured deal which saw its co-founders earn $4 billion in cash, $12 billion in Facebook shares and $3 billion in restricted stock units. WhatsApp messages have end-to-end encryption which means no one can “hack” into them, the combination of high-level security and popularity has seen WhatsApp blocked in most hostile countries as some Governments view it as more of a threat than innovation. WhatsApp continues to grow its massive user base especially in developing countries like India and Brazil where it has become one of the most threating OTT services to mobile telecom revenues. The services also continue to add new features like video calling and image editing adding on to its popularity.

Elyse Betters28 March 2017Smart Home Pocket-lint 4.0 stars £129 For Good-looking design will integrate anywhere around the home, touchpanel controls, future potential is great, in-depth conversational and search-based results Against Less third-party app support than Amazon Echo, Assistant doesn't sound as good as Amazon Alexa, microphone pick-up limited when music is playing Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment If there's one thing Google is good at, it's search. Its 20 years of experience has helped it to become the number one site we all go to when we want to look up anything. Heck, most people just say "Google it". Beyond search we use Google brands for a range of tasks, including getting directions, sending email, and watching videos. In early 2016 Google came up with Google Assistant: a voice-based, conversational way for us to interact with Google's products and services. These have all been stepping stones to Google Home: the company's £129/$129 connected speaker. A home hub device that, for the first time in Google's history, allows you to leverage all of what Google offers without having to tap or click on a screen. It will be in the UK from 6 April 2017, following in the footsteps of its 2016 US launch. Which all sounds very exciting. But then there's Amazon's competitor, Echo, which has been in the market since 2014 and is further down the line in third-party app integration. Do two decades of search experience give Home the edge it needs over Echo? Google Home review: Flexible design 96.4mm (D), 142.8mm (H); 477g White finish, interchangeable bases Touchpanel and voice control Home is a minimalist's dream. It's a short device - about half the size of Echo - that complements anything from Ikea. It's only available in white, but you can still match it to your decor by swapping out the bases (Google is selling $20 optional bases that come in a variety of fabric or metal finishes and colours). Pocket-lint We have to mention it though: most of our friends say Home looks like an air freshener. We don't mind as that just means we can place it anywhere, from kitchen to bedroom. It doesn't smell like potpourri thankfully. The top of Home slopes at an angle and hides a touch-sensitive panel that you can swipe gestures upon to change volume, play and pause music, and activate Assistant's listening mode. You'll see colourful, very Googley lights glow in the panel when Home hears its wake words "OK Google" or "Hey Google" or it responds to a command. Amazon Echo, on the other hand, has a blue ring of light at the top with a physical rotation ring. Echo also has physical buttons press to mute the listening mode and whatnot, which just doesn't look or feel as futuristic as Home's setup. Google Home review: Voice control Voice-control using "OK Google" or "Hey Google" wake words Far-field voice recognition for hands-free use The only other things you'll notice about the top-half of Home are these two divots for the far-field microphones, which theoretically allow Home to pick up your voice commands from across a room. That's key for a largely voice-controlled product. Pocket-lint However, we found that their pickup weren't very accurate when the device's speaker at the bottom is blaring out tunes full blast. With quieter or no music playing, however, it had no problem hearing us. Google has tweaked the device for regional accents, so for its 6 April UK launch it comes with a distinctly more British accent than its American cousin. It can do translations in various accents too. Similar to Amazon Echo, Home can listen and respond to your voice commands. You can't change the OK Google/Hey Google wake words, and you must say them every single time you want to interact with Home. This can be a bit of a barrier for Assistant's potential conversational capabilities and, just like with Echo, we'd like a more natural to-and-fro conversation. Some people don't like the idea of Google always listening to you and your household while relaying information to the cloud for processing. So, in an effort to alleviate any privacy concerns, Google has promised it's not constantly recording you, and it even includes a mute button that completely turns off the listening feature. Google also allows you to peek at all the data Home sends back and forth (go to myactivity.google.com). Pocket-lint When we looked at our activity, it was obvious that we mostly use Home as a connected music speaker. Google Home review: Speaker quality 2-inch speaker driver Two 2-inch passive radiators No Bluetooth connectivity As for the audio quality, Home has two passive radiators for bass and the output is adequate enough to fill a room. We think it's plenty loud, with fair sound quality for its £129 asking price. If you're just looking for an average speaker to sit on your kitchen counter or bedroom nightstand and casually play some tunes, rest assured that it'll get the job done just fine. We streamed tunes from built-in sources like Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Spotify, and Pandora. We even used it to wirelessly cast audio from our phone and laptop. Pocket-lint Unfortunately, Google Home doesn't have Bluetooth connectivity like Echo, so you'll need to use apps and services with it that support Google Cast - but that's basically everything. Home can also send audio to a Chromecast Audio-connected speaker. Just say "Hey Google, play this on Chromecast Audio". Or if you plug a Chromecast into, let's say, a bedroom TV, you can say "OK Google, play Pocket-lint videos on my bedroom TV" (it only does this with YouTube and Netflix at present, but there's scope for that to expand). Finally, you can group multiple Home speakers together and stream through all them at the same time. Echo can group Echo units together, too, plus it supports casting to Fire TV devices. Pocket-lint Interestingly, we found that Home needed to know the exact name of a song if we asked it to cue something specific, and it wouldn't understand us when we accidentally left out a word from the song title, whereas Echo never seems to have this problem. Google Home review: Google Assistant Supports Android 4.2 / iOS 8.0 and higher Home is all about Assistant, really, which is the gateway to question-and-answer information. Assistant doesn't have a real-person name, like Alexa or Siri, but it does have a (sort-of robotic) female voice, which you can't change. What is Google Assistant? And she's always waiting for you to talk to it or ask it something. Currently, you can call on those everyday, mundane tasks like manage cooking timers, set morning alarms, and remember shopping lists. You can also ask Assistant to fetch weather and traffic information, look up flights, check your calendar, get local business information, and order an Uber for you. Assistant even does jokes and trivia: Just say "OK Google, entertain me" and see what happens next. Pocket-lint However, Assistant is a fairly basic assistant right now. Especially for Google and when considering the bigger picture. We'd love if Home could check our Gmail for new messages or track our packages, but it can't do that. We'd also like it to text or call our friends for us, even through our wirelessly connected Android device, but it can't do that either. We'd even love the ability to add appointments to our Google Calendar or set reminders, but again, it can't do any of that... yet(?). At least it's got some of the typical stuff down; it quickly became our daily alarm clock and the easiest way to check the score of the most recent Miami Hurricanes game. Google Home review: Searching for answers Where Home has a notable upper hand over Amazon Echo is in search capability. Pocket-lint First, understand that Assistant can follow your use of pronouns and remember context for follow-up questions, whereas Alexa cannot. That means you can ask "OK Google, who is the President of the US?" and then ask "OK Google, how old is he?", and Assistant will know you're asking about the President's age. Second, Assistant pulls from most of Google's online services as well as its deep well of search knowledge. You can ask what you should have for dinner, and Google Assistant will locate local places to eat and serve up suggestions. There are endless things you can ask, and nine times out of 10 it will have an answer for you. Alexa, on the other hand, really seems to love the phrase "I don't understand the question." If you do happen to stump Assistant, it simply apologises and says it can't do that "yet", which is a subtle way for Google to remind people that more features are coming. Assistant is supposed to smartly hand-off commands too. We use a Google Pixel XL which also has Google Assistant built-in and is meant to be clever enough to understand when you're talking to Home rather than the phone. Sadly, that's not the case: more often than not we wouldn't get a response from Assistant on Home, but rather on our phone. Pocket-lint But the biggest gripe we have with Google Home/Assistant is that it only works with one Google account at a time. It remembers search history, music tastes, purchases, and all sorts of other data that's based on you, for you. It surfaces your calendar and adds stuff to your shopping lists and knows all about your day - but no one else's, which means it isn't family-friendly in a sense. For a speaker that's meant to be the hub a of a home, it certainly could do a little better at servicing the entire household. What apps does Google Home support? Home is designed to sit in your house and not only be your assistant but also your primary means of controlling smart home gadgets - with just your voice. And, yes, Echo does this too. With either speaker, you can turn your smart lights on or off, control your smart thermostat, and more. You can also program IFTTT commands. They're true control centers for the home. However, because Echo has been around for two years longer, it has a big leg up in terms of integrations. Right now, Home supports Google Nest, Philips Hue, Samsung SmartThings, Belkin Wemo, and Honeywell smart devices. That list has increased since its US launch, and will continue to grow, but it's not quite as wide-ranging as the Echo's extensive list. It's a game of catch-up, though, and we get the strong feeling that Google integration will be accelerating fast. Verdict Does two decades of search experience give Home the upper hand over Amazon Echo? In terms of search results, yes. But is it the better product? Not always. Home might be better looking, but it's not as well rounded... yet. That's largely because Home is in its early days and can't hold a candle to Echo when it comes to controlling the home. Amazon's Alexa assistant has thousands of skills: it can send texts through AT&T and read recipes from Allrecipes.com; it's got tonnes of app integrations available from the likes of Expedia, Thrive, Capital One and beyond. So if you want the full-blown voice-activated connected speaker experience right out of the gate, you're silly to consider anything other than Echo. But here's our prediction: within two years, Google Home will probably have just as many integrations and partnerships available as Echo, perhaps even more. Home is already better at conversational points and search. Plus it's £30 cheaper than Echo and doesn't want you to add an annual Amazon Prime subscription into the mix to get the most out of it either. So, in many ways, we prefer Home. If you don't mind waiting for it to mature, then it's the speaker to get. It's better looking and better sounding too and, we suspect, has the potential to be the best voice-assistant speaker going. The alternatives to consider... Pocket-lint Amazon Echo £149 With its Alexa voice-control assistant, Echo is the premier home product: it can play music, interact with third-party apps (including home controls, such as Nest heating adjustment and Hue lighting controls) and plug-into all the great and the good of an Amazon Prime subscription too. It's perhaps not as smart or conversational as Home for everything, but it's the must-have voice-assistant home speaker to buy right now.

 This ex-Microsoft exec is charged with making programmers love Google Matt Weinberger Mar. 28, 2017, 8:00 AM 3,811 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google Cloud VP Sam RamjiGoogle For the lion's share of his five-year stint with Microsoft, Sam Ramji had a job unlike any other, acting as liaison between Microsoft and the community of open source, Linux-loving programmers it viewed as a huge threat. "I was the odd man out," Ramji tells Business Insider. Nowadays, Ramji is about four months into a new gig serving as VP of Product Management for Google Cloud, a service where developers rent functionally unlimited supercomputing power straight from the search engine's own global server infrastructure.  And while Google has never been shy about its love for open source, Ramji still says his new role is "not too different" than his time at Microsoft. Ramji's job is "building bridges" with programmers, working to convince them that Google, not Microsoft or Amazon, is the right digital home for their most critical software. The opportunity is huge, says Ramji, but so is the challenge. From his perspective, Google can win developers over, just as long as it doesn't abandon Larry Page and Sergey Brin's famous 2004 declaration that "Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one." In other words, Ramji says, he thinks Google can win against the leading Amazon Web Services and the second-place Microsoft Azure clouds by "being enterprise-y, but staying Google-y." The push for enterprise Under the leadership of VMware cofounder Diane Greene, Google Cloud has been making a major push to close its competitive gap by selling the service to large businesses.  To Ramji, the gameplan is pretty straightforward: Build a service that developers, all kinds of developers, actually like using. Very often, the programmers in even the biggest, stodgiest, most bureaucratic companies still do their own personal projects on nights and weekends.  "Enterprise developers are developers on the weekend, too," Ramji says. "An enterprise developer is just a developer who works at an enterprise."  Google Cloud chief Diane GreeneBusiness Insider That's key to the Google gameplan, says Ramji. Even if the IT department is wary of giving Google Cloud a look after many years of being happy Microsoft or Amazon customers, Ramji's plan is to reach out to communities of developers and convince them to give it a shot.  From there, Ramji highlights the progress that Google has made in getting its cloud prepped for the largest companies. A major push for Google is in making sure that its cloud computing platform integrates both with their customers data centers (called "hybrid cloud") as well as with other providers, including Amazon and Microsoft. "Enterprises need a cloud provider that respects their architecture, which is multi-cloud and hybrid," Ramji says. The challenge So, that's the strategy. Now, Ramji has to think tactically about the best way of rolling out the red carpet for developers. "There's still an awareness gap," says Ramji, so "our front door has to be awesome."  A big part of the reason Ramji made the switch from his previous gig as CEO of the Cloud Foundry Foundation, a nonprofit software organization, was because he kept hearing and seeing that Google Cloud was faster and cheaper than the competition. That performance is great, Ramji says, and something Google is going to keep investing in. But with so much marketing buzz around each cloud, and a general perception that the major cloud platforms are pretty much equivalent feature-wise, it takes more to win over developers. Google Cloud is computing infrastructure rented out of the search giant's own data centers.Google He says that stuff like offering developers free Google Cloud services, giving them plenty of documentation for how to use it, and generally working with the community is a huge help — Ramji says that Google Cloud engineers often hop into Reddit or Hacker News threads to offer help and advice. Plus, Ramji says, Google runs a few different programs to embed its engineers and systems architects in with customers, helping them build and manage their software in the same way that Google itself does. "We're here before and after the sale," Ramji says. The Google advantage There's a more ineffable advantage held by Google, says Ramji. In his time as an industry exec, Ramji has been around the block a few times, working at tech companies large and small. But he says he's continually impressed with the sheer quantity of smart people at the company working on big-impact passion projects. He describes the general feeling at Google as "like a Montessori school where the kids are in charge." Google's Urs Hölzle removes the company's "Titan" security chip from his earring during a keynote at Google Cloud Next '17.Google In his experience, however limited, that means that there's also an astonishing number of Googlers who come into Google Cloud, stay for a while, and then go off to work on Google Docs or search advertising or even take posts at the self-driving car spinoff Google, and vice versa. It means a constant flow of fresh talent with different skillsets. "We don't hire for the job, we hire for Google," says Ramji. In its own way, though, that could be a potential roadblock, says Ramji. When you're inside Google, you get used to doing things at Google's pace. That has the potential to alienate Google Cloud customers, Ramji says, if they mishandle things, given that most large companies don't build software at Google's speed. "Sometimes you'll accelerate too fast and the wheels falls off," Ramji says. Get the latest Google stock price here.

Those rules, not yet in effect, would have required internet providers to ask your permission before sharing your personal information. That’s a much stronger privacy-protection weapon than letting them use your data until you tell them to stop. As anyone who has ever tried to stop getting targeted ads on the internet knows, opting out is hard. Without those protections, consumer advocates fear that broadband providers will be able to do what they like with people’s data. “Advertisers and marketers are lining up to get access to all the information that’s now available about us,” said Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy, which advocates for tougher internet privacy measures. ONLINE PRIVACY? WHAT ONLINE PRIVACY? Of course, Google and Facebook already track you. But proponents of the privacy measure argued that the company that sells you your internet connection can see even more about you: every website you visit, every app that sends or receives data, everyone you email and many that you message. Telecom companies argue that companies like Google know far more about users than they do. Consumer advocates also point out that it can be hard, in many areas of the country, to dump your cable or phone company for another one if you don’t like its practices. Of course, it’s also hard to stop using Google or Facebook. Undoing the Federal Communications Commission’s regulation leaves people’s online information in a murky area. Today, you can tell a broadband provider not to use your data. Experts say federal law still requires broadband providers to protect customer information — but it doesn’t spell out how or what companies must do. That’s what the now endangered rules from the Federal Communications Commission aimed to do. “There’s kind of a void,” said Perkins Coie telecom attorney Marc Martin. BUIDLING DIGITAL-AD BUSINESSESES Cable companies, cellphone carriers and the advertising industry attacked the FCC rules as an overreach. Having to get permission from customers to use their browsing and app histories would likely make it more difficult to build stronger ad businesses, as telecomcompanies want to do. Internet companies like Google operate under laxer requirements and don’t have to ask users’ permission before tracking what sites they visit. Republicans and industry groups have blasted that discrepancy, saying it was unfair and confusing for consumers. REGULATORY TUSSLE If the just-passed measure also clears the House and is signed by President Donald Trump, no future FCC could pass the broadband privacy rules again without further change to U.S. law. The Trump-appointed chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a critic of the broadband privacy rules and has said he wants to roll them back , along with other Obama-era policies meant to protect consumers and promote competition. He and other Republicans want a different federal agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to police privacy for both broadband companies like AT&T and internet companies like Google. But broadband providers don’t currently fall under FTC jurisdiction, and advocates say the FTC has historically been a weaker agency than the FCC. “At the FCC, consumers are much more protected with strong privacy rules that give (internet service providers) clear rules as to what’s fair and what’s foul,” Dallas Harris, a policy fellow with consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said last month. “The FCC is a stronger entity with a bit more teeth to hold ISPs’ feet to the fire.” For more business headlines from Jane King at the Nasdaq, watch Daybreak Monday through Friday.

Howard University hide caption toggle caption Howard University Students at Howard University in Washington, D.C. The historically black university is opening Howard West at Google's headquarters in Mountain View. Howard University It's clear from the numbers. Google has a diversity problem. For the past few years, the company has publicly shared its workplace makeup in a report detailing the race, gender and ethnicity of each employee hired the previous year. Last year, while the number of black employees went up, they still represented only 2 percent of the company's workforce and Google admitted it fell short of its diversity goal. In one small step to grow those numbers, this summer 25 students from Howard University, the historically black university based in Washington, D.C., will train at the tech giant's headquarters in Mountain View, Caif. With Howard West, as it's being called, Google believes it can meet that goal faster, says Bonita Stewart, the company's vice president of global partnerships. "We have the opportunity to be able to build a qualified pipeline of talent across the black community," she says. NPR Ed A High School's Lesson For Helping English Language Learners Get To College The pipeline, or the pipeline problem, is an idea commonly held in Silicon Valley that there just aren't enough blacks, Latinos and women with computer programming skills to fill jobs. The 25 students at Howard West will be mentored by Google engineers and get regular classroom instruction from Howard professors. Howard and Google plan to train 750 students over five years and will open the program to students from all historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. Wayne A.I. Frederick, Howard's president, says this is an important step, "but I think just as important, will be exposure to the culture here." Frederick heard from alums working in the industry, who said they felt Howard prepared them technically, but not culturally, to work in Silicon Valley. There's the management style, which values collaboration over hierarchy, the importance of networking and, of course, how to dress. "So, for instance, I'm dressed in a suit and tie, and I haven't seen anybody else in a suit and a tie," he says, jokingly. "So that's one example to just being exposed to that culture." Christian Simamora, of Code2040, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing the number of blacks and Latinos in the tech sector, applauds the opening of Howard West. He's concerned, though, that the narrative will become, "there's a pipeline problem," he says. NPR Ed Can Schools Solve The Tech Industry's Pipeline Problem? "We would hire more black engineers if we could find them," Simamora says, mimicking a common refrain from tech companies. "The fact of the matter is the talent is there." Simamora points out that about 18 percent of computer science majors in the U.S. identify as black or Latino, but they represent only 5 percent of the technology workforce. He says the problem is with recruitment. "Many of the top tech companies aren't even recruiting at the HBCUs — Howard, Spelman. All these schools have CS programs." So why aren't big tech companies recruiting at HBCUs? "I can't speak for those companies," he says. "But what I find interesting is that tech disrupts; tech hiring does not disrupt. It does not question what came before it." Simamora says many tech companies continue to focus their recruitment efforts at a few schools, like Stanford, Harvard and MIT - the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Considering that, Simamora says the opening of Howard West at Google is disruptive and might force the tech industry to start acting differently. black engineers tech companies Howard University tech industry Silicon Valley hbcu Google Facebook Twitter Google+ Email nprEd HOW LEARNING HAPPENS nprEd HOW LEARNING HAPPENS About We've been to school.

Recent surveys show that more than 90% of all clients have used Google searches and online reviews to find both online and offline businesses and products, making online visibility key to overall business success.

To increase page responsiveness, the software includes page speed optimization functions allowing the user to control a variety of page metrics directly linked to loading times. The website also offers cross-platform responsive webpages that can be viewed on smartphones, tablets and other devices.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Google Home launching in UK for £129: How does it compare against Amazon Echo? Google is also launching Google Wifi in the UK on April 6. Sami Khan   March 28, 2017 17:23 IST Twitter/@madebygoogle Amazon Echo has enjoyed popularity without any rivalry in the UK, but that's about to change soon. Google announced that it will be launching its smart speaker – Google Home – in the UK on April 6, stepping up the pace on the niche smart home battle in a new market. This is also the first time Google Home is stepping outside its home country since the official launch in the U.S. last October. The device has received positive reviews so far, giving Amazon a tough competition. In the UK, Google Home will be priced at £129, which works out at £20 cheaper than Amazon Echo's £149 price tag. Google's smart speaker has managed to outperform Amazon Echo, but Amazon's outreach to partner with third-party developers has worked well in its favour. According to Edison Investment Research's Richard Windsor, Amazon has managed to sell 10 million units of Echo smart speakers compared to less than a million Google Home devices, the Guardian reported. Amazon faces a serious threat from Google, but it is still in the lead. For so long, shoppers in the UK had no option but to go with Amazon Echo. With the upcoming launch of Google Home, it will be interesting to see how the trend changes from here onwards. Amazon Echo and Google Home are great devices in their own way. There are many similarities and some unique elements that make the products stand out. Both speakers come with smart digital assistants that can carry out most of the operations assigned to them. Google Home is integrated with Google Assistant, which gets activated with the signature "Ok Google" command. You can throw any question at Google Home and it will find an answer for you in a matter of seconds. The speaker, other than playing music, understands you better with time, thanks to the machine learning capabilities, and answers follow-up questions to your initial voice commands. Google Home's cross-integration will also allow users to control other smart devices around the home, such as light bulbs, thermostats, TVs and other speakers. The device comes in different colour shades, so you can match it to your interiors easily. If you are still looking to buy the Amazon Echo, it is certainly not a bad choice. Amazon has the advantage of playing this smart home game for longer than Google. In addition to doing everything Google Home does, it handles third-party devices support extensively. Amazon Echo works with devices from a wide range of brands like Nest, Philips, SmartThings, Belkin, Wink, Insteon and more. It has more than 3,000 skills up its sleeve for you to explore. Wait... there's more! Google WifiGoogle official website Google Home isn't the only product set for launch in the U.K. next month. The internet search titan is also going to launch Google Wifi for £129. The wireless router promises to deliver a consistently strong coverage through its mesh system.

The speaker comes with the Google Assistant built-in, allowing users to ask it questions, control the connected devices in their home or just simply play music. The Huffington Post UK If this sounds an awful lot like Amazon Echo then you’re bang on the money. Home is Google’s direct response to Echo. Packed into its small but surprisingly weighty body you’ll find three powerful speakers along with two specially tuned microphones that allow you to communicate with Google’s personal assistant. The Huffington Post UK Google claims that the microphones are ‘best in class’ allowing you to talk to Google Assistant as you would another person. Simply activate the speaker by saying “Ok Google” and then start your request. For news and weather Google has partnered with every major news organisation in the UK giving you flash updates on the days events as and when you need. For audio it’s compatible with Google Play Music, Spotify and TuneIn. If you have any Chromecast’s connected you’ll also be able to use Google Home to play content from Google Play or Netflix. The Huffington Post UK The company also unveiled a brand new router which it claims will combat the many connection woes that plague large houses. Called Google WiFi, this small but powerful device uses a new technology called mesh networking to connect to devices around the home. Designed to be used with other Google WiFi units dotted around the house the router creates a ‘web’ which then encompasses the entire building. While your device might switch between devices you’ll never notice, instead the routers all work in sync creating one single network that you connect to once and never have to worry about again. The Best Gadgets You Can Buy In 2017 Xbox One S Microsoft If you own a 4K TV and also own an original Xbox One then the Xbox One S is the console for you. It is quite simply Microsoft’s best Xbox ever, it’s also the cheapest 4K Blu-ray player you’ll be able to buy this side of Christmas. Your games collection will look stunning and if you trade in your old console the relatively small cost shouldn’t sting while you wait for Microsoft’s uber-console Project Scorpio to arrive next year. Apple iPhone 7 Apple This is Apple’s best iPhone ever, and if we’re honest it’s one of their most innovative devices yet. Its exceptional camera, combined with with a slim, water-resistant body mean that while it's not a leap in design it is a leap in just about everything else. No it doesn't have a headphone jack, but wireless audio is finally ready. Sky Q Sky Sky Q as a complete package is the future, not just one single feature.It’s knowing that everything you’ve ever recorded is available in every room. It’s knowing that you can download any recorded show onto your iPad. It’s also knowing that every Sky Q box also doubles as a WiFi hotspot.This is where Sky Q makes sense. This is an all-in-one system, it does literally everything. There’s no switching, no painful tinkering, it all neatly fits together and if there’s one thing us humans like it’s everything working just as it should. Google Pixel Google This is Google’s iPhone. It’s that simple. As such there are achievements and compromises. If you’re after an incredibly well-built, powerful Android flagship, Google have given you a truly five-star smartphone. If you’re a photographer, the Pixel’s camera and cloud storage option make this a no brainer. This is Google's first 'made by us' smartphone and it's absolutely brilliant. Hive Active Heating 2 Review Hive If your boiler is compatible and you’re willing to spend the initial £249 (including installation) then Hive is one of the most complete smart home systems we’ve ever seen. While Nest offers third-party accessories like Philips Hue, Hive almost fights back by keeping things simple: If it’s got the Hive logo on it you know it works. Components are reasonably priced and the entire system has been utterly rock solid, we haven’t had a single issue since installation. Amazon Echo Amazon Amazon Echo works best when you have other gadgets that it can utilise such as Hive, Nest or Philips Hue. On its own its an incredibly smart speaker, paired with these other gadgets though and it becomes the fully fledged conduit to your home. It’s also really good at doing homework. Alexa really is the first gadget we actually felt comfortable talking to. Roli Lightpad Block Roli Don't be alarmed by its alien appearance. This is actually one of the most innovative music-making gadgets we've used all year. A large transparent gel-like surface is both touch and pressure sensitive allowing you to create music in a way that's both utterly unique and incredibly intuitive. The accompanying app is properly easy to use and once mastered the Lightpad can become the only tool you need to create an entire song. Apple Watch Series 2 Apple The Series 2 is the complete package. It’s the smartwatch that we feel Apple always wanted to make. It’s a fitness tracker, health monitor and wellness device that’ll help you stay fit and, just as importantly, calm in mind. BeoPlay A2 Active By B&O Play Bang Olufsen At £299 this is not a cheap option, however for that money you’ll get a product that’s just as happy being your main living room speaker as it is keeping you company on a road trip. The sound quality is truly room-filling and at the high standard you would expect for a Bang & Olufson product. The A2 Active is quite simply one of the best Bluetooth speakers you can buy. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Samsung The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is powerful but won’t run out of battery, beautiful yet able to work underwater and capable of transporting you to alien worlds through the medium of virtual reality. If there’s a product that encapsulates all the of the best technologies on offer today it’s this one. Oh and it won't catch fire, so that's nice. PlayStation VR Sony At the moment, if you own a PS4 and are desperately excited to get into virtual reality, PlayStation VR is the only place to start. It’s comfortable, gloriously easy to use and when the hardware and software work in harmony it’s an utterly breathtaking experience. Visceral, emotional and yet entirely accessible, it’s a technological marvel. Bowers & Wilkins P9 Signature Bowers Wilkins Anyone who wants an industry-leading sound but without the usually eye-watering price tag. Yes, these are £699, but when you think that the average audiophile will spend upwards of £1000 on a pair of HiFi-quality headphones these make every bit of sense. They’re B&W’s best headphones ever and they’re quite frankly one of the best pairs of headphones we’ve ever used. PlayStation 4 Pro Sony If you’re looking for an affordable (it costs as much as the original PS4) entry into the world of 4K gaming then the PS4 Pro is a no brainer. Pair it with a 4K HDR TV and games look absolutely astonishing. At present most games are simply being given a new coat of paint but going forward there will be an army of titles designed with this console in mind. OnePlus 3T OnePlus The OnePlus 3T is simply a continuation of the ethos that makes OnePlus phones so good. It’s exceptionally well-built, powerful and offers you everything you could want in an affordable and meaningful package. No smartphone will give you more value for money. Beats by Dre Powerbeats3 Wireless Beats by Dre While Apple's AirPods might have got most of the limelight in the post-iPhone 7 world it's actually Apple-owned Beats who have given us the ultimate solution to the lack of a headphone jack.The Powerbeats3 are ultra-portable, durable, wireless headphones that are a doddle to set up and last for days then we’ve found the pair for you. They sound great, they’re comfy, they’re perfect for sports and they last for days. These are very, very good. Samsung UE49KS9000 Samsung TVs are massive these days. They're also really really expensive. The KS9000 then has a very special place in our hearts because at a very sane 49-inches it's the most living room-friendly TV we've seen in recent years. Oh and because it's part of Samsung's flagship range you're still getting probably one of the best 4K TVs on the market.  Sonos Play:5 (2nd Gen) Sonos While it was released in December of 2015, Sonos' newest speaker has played an undisputedly important role in how we consume music in 2016. This was the year of wireless and Sonos continued to show us that when it comes to ditching those wires, they were one of the best.  Withings Activite Pop Withings This is the anti-fitness tracker of fitness trackers. Boasting a beautifully minimalist design the Pop is all about getting the job done without shouting about it. A simple measurement dial at the bottom shows you varying metrics for how active you're being while Withings' app reveals just how much data is actually being collected. While Fitbit has led the way in Fitness trackers, Withings has been offering even the most resistant consumer a change to start taking better care of themselves./ More: United Kingdom Google Computers Google Home Google Assistant Suggest a correction Advertisement Suggested For You by Gravity Comments Advertisement Suggested For You Close SUBSCRIBE TO & FOLLOW UK TECH Learn more Newsletter 142 K 17.4 K 22.4 K Podcast Add us on Snapchat Advertisement Google Home Available In The UK On April 6th For £129 CONVERSATIONS Advertise RSS Careers FAQ User Agreement Privacy Comment Policy About Us About Our Ads Contact Us Archive "The Huffington Post UK" is provided by AOL (UK) Limited. © 2017 AOL (UK) Limited its affiliates and licensors.

Google Home is almost available for UK consumers, effectively replicated the much advertising Amazon Alexa/Echo proposition. The hands-free smart speaker powered by the Google Assistant will essentially act as the new interface to bolster the internet giants fortunes, tapping into Search, Maps and Translate products to build revenues in its traditional manner, but now with a modern twist. The team has also introduced Google Wifi to improve wireless connectivity throughout the home. Using Wifi-mesh technology, point creates a high-powered connection, and the different Wifi points work together to determine the best path for your data. This, in theory should allow for connectivity in parts of the home which were more difficult using traditional means. Both products will be available in the UK from April 6th. Telcos around the world have previously made their fortunes through a more product orientated business model, however with the disruption of the OTTs and a more digitally-enabled environment, those monumental profit margins are looking a thing of the past. The transition towards a service orientated business model, making use of mountains of customer data, is a logical step, however Google is looking to swoop in and steal the business before the telcos have even had a chance. The idea here would be to replicate what Facebook has done with social media. In this instance, Facebook has created a sturdy walled garden, charging premium prices for advertisers and partners to access the user. The data stash can be used to create personalized adverts to move away from less efficient over-the-top advertising strategies. With the emergence of the IoT-world, in particular the smart home, the telcos do have the opportunity to replicate this business model in the ‘offline’ world. Assuming Google doesn’t beat them to the punch. “Google Home is a hands-free smart speaker powered by the Google Assistant that does just that,” said Suveer Kothari Director, Product Partnerships & Planning for Google Home. “Whether you want to get answers from Google, turn up the music, sort out some everyday tasks or control compatible smart devices in your home, all you have to do is say “Ok Google.” And now, Google Home is coming to the UK.” While the majority of telcos will most likely put on a cool and calm face, welcoming the challenge as a catalyst for self-improvement and innovation, this is a worrying sign. The smart home was always going to be an area of growth for the digital economy, and the telcos looked like a perfect segment to capitalize on the fortunes. They’ve been the connectivity provider for years, so it could be a logical transition. But it looks like they are not acting quick enough. The major worry here is the element of trust in the brands themselves. On one hand you have the telcos who have woeful reputations for customer service, get caught by Ofcom overcharging too frequently, been the victim of data breaches on numerous occasions and fund advertising campaigns which could be seen as misleading and frustrating. Elsewhere you have Google. The world’s most successful search engine, which does have a few faults, but has a well-respected and credible reputation. The prominence of Google Play through the Android operating system is beginning to normalize the idea of giving Google your credit card details, and if you trust Google with your browsing history, there probably isn’t much you won’t trust them with. The telcos have been looking to diversify their own business models to bolster dwindling profit margins, while Google has been looking to new areas to continue to momentum it has gathered through traditional search advertising. The smart home is an area where there can be some serious cash made, and once again it looks like we’ll be saying the telcos were just a little late to the party.

COMMENT Google is taking action on sites with popup ads Ben Lobel OK, maybe not cracking down in the literal manner, but there is some penalty by way of lower SERP positioning. Google, in its constant push to provide the ideal web experience for the regular mobile internet user has introduced an algorithm, in its latest update, that seeks and penalises interstitial-guilty websites. What are interstitials? My exact thoughts the first time I heard them. Apparently, they are pop-ups that appear on a website immediately a user logs onto it. Interstitials often sell or suggest something of value to the visitor. While there’s nothing wrong with having propositions on your site, truth be told, it can be annoying to see when you are searching for important information. Especially in the intrusive way they pop-up, sort of like a Jack-in-the-box (and I never liked those toys by the way). Brendan, online expert at domains4less.co.nz says, ‘Making a proposition to site visitors in the first few seconds interferes with their overall user experience. Often, they just close the box because they are not looking to buy at that time. It’s important to build a relationship before.’ Google’s mobile-friendly ‘war’ began in early 2015 when it began dropping sites it deemed not mobile-friendly from its result page. As a result, many sites have since amended their ways. In fact, up to 85 per cent of websites are now mobile friendly, so Google has decided to take out that label. The mobilegeddon fight has since moved on to other juicier areas, like the interstitial ads. The crackdown on intrusive pop-ups Since early, January, Google has been dropping websites with intrusive ads down its search ranking page. They have described it as any item that interferes with the main content, either before, or during the time the user accesses it. They gave three instances of interstitials that make content access user-unfriendly. Displaying a pop-up that blocks the main content, either immediately the user lands on the page from search results, or while going through the page. Showing a separate interstitial which a user has to close before they can access the main content. Using a layout where the above-the-fold section of the webpage looks like the separate interstitial, but the main content is placed below the fold. The reason behind these updates can be traced back to Google’s continuous push for a more mobile friendly user experience. According to Google, these intrusive interstitials give users an inadequate experience in comparison to other webpages that present the sought content immediately and without interruption. I couldn’t agree more too. Twitter already had its response to this, with Rachel Howe, owner of Bite Sized Media, tweeting that Google had already started taking actions on the course. However, Google has also announced that not all interstitials will be punished. According to them, the following cases would not be affected by the new update, if used responsibly. Interstitials that show up in response to a legal duty, such as use of cookies, or verification of age. Login form fields on sites with content that is not publicly indexable. An example of this is private content such as email or unindexable content like credit card details. Banners that use a fair amount of screen space that can easily be dismissed. For instance, Chrome’s and Safari’s app install banners that take up little screen space. I’d like to discuss Google’s growing internet power, but before that, here are some tips to avoid falling foul of the update. How to avoid getting caught in the interstitial penalty Ensure you get rid of any intrusive interstitials that activate the moment a user lands on your website (except it fall into the exemption categories). Google isn’t saying you should get rid of pop-ups entirely, just not before or during a reader’s content consumption. So, you may hold your pop-up till the visitor is done navigating your webpage- and present it less obtrusively. Study your analytics. Do people leave at an astounding rate- is your bounce rate high? If it is, find out if you can attribute it to pop-up ads. To find out more about how people interact with your pop-up (and whether it is worth having at all), consider acquiring a heat mapping program for this insight. Some examples include Virtual Web Optimizer and Hotjar. Without entirely ridding your website of pop-ups, you can redesign or reimagine more effective ways they could be displayed without interfering with users’ experience. For example, apply the native ad format in the content structure. Make it just as seamless and attractive as possible. Look into the design and the messaging your pop-ups. Do they fit with the web branding? Also, ensure you are giving visitors something of value in return for their email address. Finally, keep testing what you have. It is only through testing that you can optimise your website for better results. Are your current pop-ups working? Which methods convert better? Conducting A/B tests of these variations will give you a better insight for the way forward. Google’s growing power Now like I said, every period, webmasters and website owner are always on the look-out for Google’s latest updates. This is necessary because one new policy could send your hard-crafted SEO effort into the drain. But the question is, what do you think about the latest update? Is it okay to have Google playing ‘net design’ watchdog? No doubt, these modifications benefit users’ mobile experience, but on the grander scale, should Google be telling site owners what their visitors think about their site experience? Or how they should design their web page…and penalising them for it? Sometime in November 2015, Jeremy Stoppelman of Yelp argued that Google was making updates to protect its monopoly on search. His argument was based on the fact that, by asking sites to remove app download banners, it was trying to prevent users from downloading them. In his defence, Stoppelman said, ‘The more people downloaded apps, the less likely they were to use search engines,’ which is not far-fetched at all. After all, when I go directly to Yelp’s app, I don’t need Google to show me the address of a restaurant anymore. As we continue to respond to the tide of updates from ‘almighty’ Google, let us pause to ask ourselves, Is Google getting too powerful?

There was participation from existing investors - Menlo Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Tenaya Capital and Western Digital Technologies - as well as its new investor, Google Inc, which notably did not invest through its funding arm, GV (Google Ventures). Initially the amount was reported as $14m but, after the initial funding announcement was made, there was an additional amount added to the round by the investors, bringing it up to $27m. The company says it wants to use the new funds to drive product innovation and help expand its hybrid cloud product offerings. CEO, president and co-founder Ron Bianchini said: “In 2016 alone, Avere has grown its cloud business by 97 per cent, nearly doubling growth from the previous year, and closed the year with cloud offerings driving close to half of our annual bookings.” The 11-year-old firm developed its technology to run in remote and branch offices, also to front-end public cloud storage, and then extended its software to run in the public cloud. The company sees its customers using a mix of on-premises (private) and public cloud storage and compute facilities; it’s a hybrid world as far as it is concerned. It received a $15m A-round in 2009, a $17m B-round in 2010, a $20m C-round in 2012, and another $20m in a 2014 D-round. With the latest E-round, total funding is now $97m. We asked Bianchini some questions around the new funding. El Reg: How far away is profitability? Ron Bianchini: Our current forecast show us reaching profitability in 2018. El Reg: What are the features of the hybrid cloud (in more detail than the release) that you will be using the E-round funding for? Ron Bianchini: We're not ready to discuss new cloud products at this time; however, big areas of continued focus for us are ease of deployment within the public cloud and further in-cloud performance and scalability enhancements. El Reg: Will you aim to take advantage of 3D Xpoint and possibly other storage-class memory media in your products? Where would such media fit in your existing media tiers in your hardware? Ron Bianchini: It is not on the roadmap at this time, but we like to think of our architecture as storage media agnostic. When one type of media has outlived its usefulness, there is no technical reason why it can't or shouldn't be replaced with something better. El Reg: What public clouds do you support, which are on the roadmap? What protocols will be used to access them? Ron Bianchini: We support Google, AWS and Azure (bursting only). No others are currently on the roadmap - these three representing more than 90 per cent market share of public cloud spend. We use S3 to access the storage portion of the cloud and NAS protocols for cloudbursting. El Reg: Do you have a multi-cloud strategy, with your customers able to use two or more public clouds simultaneously? Ron Bianchini: Yes, this is one of the strengths of an Avere solution, to provide customers the ability to mirror storage between clouds with our FlashMirror product. This is a popular feature for customers who want to avoid lock-in to a single cloud provider. El Reg: Any Internet of Things edge device interest from Avere? Ron Bianchini: We are interested in supporting any devices that speak the same protocol language as we do. +Comment Fishing for new product info in Avere’s pool is a pretty unrewarding pastime. Our thinking is that $27m is a healthy dose of cash and that some of it will fund software development to enhance the in-cloud product’s performance and scalability. We also think that on-premises FXT kit will get easier interaction with the public cloud, but it doesn't take a genius to work that out. ® Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register NAS vendor Synology taking on Microsoft, Dell, Slack and AWS Plans own European data centre for cloudy VM failover from new all-flash rack-mount NAS AWS cloud cash share: Bigger than Microsoft, IBM, Google COMBINED Cloud democratising IT?

Google Removes Location Sharing in Google+ Before Rolling It Out on Maps GO The feature now redirects users to Google Maps Mar 28, 2017 11:02 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Last week, Google anxiously announced that it would introduce a new feature for Android, iOS and desktop users of its Maps platform. The new tool would allow users to share their real-time location and ETA with friends and family. To do so, users would simply need to open the side menu inside Google Maps or tap on the blue dot showing their location on the map. Location sharing was designed as a simple and quick method for everyone to share their current position and let people know how much time is left before they reach their destination. In its release report, Google didn’t mention when the new feature would roll out to all users, the tech giant only said that it would reach Android, iOS and desktop users soon. Location sharing is disabled in Google+ But it seems that Google has already disabled the feature in Google+ and redirected users towards Google Maps, as Android Police noticed. When users tap on the side menu in Google+ and choose Locations, the app displays a message saying that “Location sharing has moved to Google Maps.” It also says that users should continue to Google Maps to choose the people they want to share their location with. That’s quite simple and straight-forward, except for the fact that location sharing in Google Maps is not yet live for everyone. Perhaps, Google intends to start rolling out the feature as soon as possible, but decided to remove the feature from Google+ beforehand. Either way, users are now left without any solution from Google to share their current location with friends and family, except for the Trusted Contacts app. The move does come just a day after Facebook announced that it introduced live location sharing in its Messenger app, both on Android and iOS. Nonetheless, Google will surely sort this out very soon, with an update to bring live location sharing to its Maps application. #Google#Maps#Location sharing#Google+#Android subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Facebook Adds Live Location Sharing Feature to Messenger App Google Is Reportedly Killing Hangouts Text Messaging Feature Google Updates Duo with Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Google Adds New Maps Feature for Sharing Your Real-Time Location and ETA The Best Antivirus Software for Windows 7 Phishing Campaign Promises Free In-Game Pets to World of Warcraft Players Mozilla Firefox 52.0.2 Released to Fix Linux Crash on Startup, Other Issues HTC U Flagship With Touch-Sensitive Frame to Launch in April Samsung Galaxy S8 User Guide Leaks Hours before Official Unveiling Microsoft Releases a New Windows 10 Build for Mobile but It’s Not What You Think The Best Antivirus Software for Windows 7 Oracle Linux 6.9 Released with Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel 4.1.12, TLS 1.2    Google+ location sharing moved to Google Maps New Android APKs Growtopia APK: Updated March 28th, 11:49 GMT feedly APK: Updated March 28th, 11:46 GMT Night Owl APK: Updated March 28th, 11:44 GMT NewsTab APK: Updated March 28th, 11:41 GMT Star Trek Timelines APK: Updated March 28th, 11:36 GMT Khan Academy APK: Updated March 28th, 11:32 GMT N.O.V.A.

One of the biggest features of Truecaller 8 on Android — iOS users still have to wait a while — is a new SMS filtering feature. Truemessenger, a standalone app that did this, has now been integrated into the main Truecaller interface. Following the update, you’ll now be able to identify unknown messages and block that pesky spam from marketers and retailers alike. Truecaller points out that you can even block SMS by name and number series. Additional functionality includes a flash messaging feature, which, allows you to respond to messages with quick, canned responses. These responses even include location information. Truecaller calls this Flash Messaging. Yet another feature is Google Duo integration. Google Duo is a simplified video calling app from Google that’s meant to make video calling as simple as a voice call. The app will soon feature a Duo button alongside contact information, allowing you to initiate a Duo-enabled video call from within Truecaller itself. The feature also means that Truecaller will filter out video call spammers as well. The above update isn’t yet available and will be integrated into Truecaller “in the coming months” as an opt-in service. These updates are welcome, but not as welcome as a couple of India-specific updates that are making their way to the app. For a start, Truecaller is partnering with Airtel to deliver advanced caller ID functionality to feature phones. Truecaller doesn’t directly support feature phones, but the partnership means that Airtel will be able to query a Truecaller database to deliver caller ID directly to feature phone users. Bigger than this, however, is the announcement of Truecaller Pay. Keeping up with the times, and maybe a little late to the party, Truecaller will be embracing the Digital India and cash less India initiatives by offering its own version of a digital wallet service. To be launched in partnership with ICICI Bank, Truecaller will integrate UPI support to enable transactions via a Virtual Payment Address unique to every user. These transactions will be handled by ICICI Bank, which means that Truecaller itself will not be handling your financial data. So there you have it. Truecaller 8 it is coming to Android soon and will offer a great deal more functionality than it’s been offering up to this point. Are you excited? Let us know in the comments section below.

YouTube's ad troubles, with brands freezing spending, could cost it $750 million, according to one estimate. Credit: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg Most Popular There are some in the ad industry who are likely a little gleeful about YouTube's current state. For them, it's rewarding to see such a dominant player fall. In some cases, the critics even benefit. That's just part of the YouTube pile-on ever since major advertisers started freezing their spending on the video site because brands' ads were seen alongside objectionable videos. The backlash has gotten so great that some have predicted the ad freeze from major brands could cost YouTube $750 million. With that amount of money at stake there are going to be some winners and losers, and here they are: WINNERS Old-fashioned publishers These are the classic media players who started losing their lunch the second Google started owning the internet. One could imagine publishers grinning ear to ear, thinking, "Told ya so. Quality content isn't so easy." "There could be a flight to quality," said Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade group that supports publishers. "If it doesn't happen now, then I don't know when it will." Now The New York Times, The Guardian, Condé Nast, Hearst, Gannett and the like can make a convincing case that knowing the content and the audience actually is still important. On a more conspiratorial note, some analysts have even suggested the story of extremist content on YouTube is getting so much attention because old media is eager to cover it. Streamers "Sling, Dish and TV networks all benefit," said one ad tech exec speaking on condition of anonymity. "Really anyone selling streaming ads is in a good position." Heading into the TV upfront season, a diminished YouTube helps everyone else looking to win over advertisers. At the upfronts, Hulu, Roku, TV networks and anyone with a digital video platform will be showing off their highly curated content. These new shows and programming will look pretty good compared to, say, terrorist attack and extremist rant videos for brands looking for safety. Tech tools The industry already has been demanding the technology to monitor online ads to fight fake traffic and viewability issues. Brands have called for digital platforms like Facebook and Google to clean up the media supply chain and to be more transparent with data. The brand safety issue on YouTube is yet another bit of leverage to force more cooperation. Independent third parties like Integral Ad Science, Double Verify, Moat and others will find more brands at their doorsteps looking for ways to ensure their ads appear near quality content. The agency One of the most important roles for agencies was helping brands make sure their ads didn't show up in the wrong place -- that ads ran where they said they'd run on TV and in print. Well, now that service is valuable again. "There's an opportunity for agencies here," Mr. Kint said. LOSERS Net neutrality Net neutrality, which Google supported in previous battles, prevents internet service providers such as Comcast and AT&T from charging the biggest users of bandwidth (such as YouTube) anything to offset the costs they incur. When the Trump administration moves to undo net neutrality, as many anticipate, Google's ability to defend it in idealistic terms could be undermined by all the talk about serving ads on terrorist video. Programmatic It took a long time for programmatic to stop being a dirty word. Programmatic advertising was once considered the least controlled, lowest quality ad inventory at the lowest price. In part, Google helped change that image with more selective programmatic advertising. Related Stories Meet the Man Behind YouTube's Sudden Ad Crisis. He Has a Patented Fix Marketers Halting YouTube Buys Puts Pressure on Media Shops J&J and Verizon Join Major Marketers Suspending YouTube Advertising "This moratorium could hit open exchanges," said Eric Franchi, co-founder of Undertone, the digital ad company bought by Perion. "Brands could start to pull back from blind, untargeted buying without transparency." YouTubers There is a whole community of YouTubers that is about to be impacted by changes coming to YouTube that could hurt their earnings. YouTube has said that part of its solution is to implement stricter community standards, and that could mean more bannings and ad blocking from their videos. YouTube is trying to walk a line between allowing a free exchange of ideas on the site while also giving advertisers the ability to choose where their ads appear. However, it could be quicker to cut a channel at the least offense now that brands are watching closely. Advertisers still on YouTube OK, this was a tough call. On one hand, there could be some cheap media to buy on YouTube while other brands are retrenching. How bad could it be, really, to keep ads going? Well, YouTube is still implementing its fixes, so ads can still appear near undesirable content. Brands like Casper mattress company basically have the run of the site. That's fine, but YouTube's brand mix does seem less diverse, and nobody needs to see the same ad 100 times.

Along with news of this integration, Truecaller announced a completely new redesign of the Android app, and now with a broader array of useful features including: SMS: Instantly see who’s SMS’ing you and filter out all spam messages. Spam SMS account for 15% of all SMS messages sent globally, and represents 1.2 trillion spam messages each year. Flash Messaging: which allows you to send quick pre-defined messages to any Truecaller user to let them know if you’re in distress, you’re on your way, your location, or that you’ve reached home. “From the very beginning we have worked relentlessly to build a product that helps simplify communications for consumers across the globe, and help them address important needs such knowing the identity of those calling, and blocking unwanted numbers. With valuable partners like Google, we are excited to take the next step in our journey, bringing all your mobile communications under one roof and giving you the safest, most efficient, and most convenient experience possible without having to switch back and forth,” said Nami Zarringhalam, Co-founder and CSO of Truecaller. “Video calling should work for everybody, regardless of what platform they are on. Our aim is to make video calling simple, fast, and available to everyone,” said Amit Fulay, Head of Duo at Google. “With this Truecaller integration, we’re able to bring a better video calling experience to millions of new users.” The new look and feel of Truecaller is consistent with its ongoing commitment to provide a safe and efficient experience for millions of mobile users who’ve become increasingly frustrated by the growing problem of spam calls and texts from unknown users. Now as one of the fastest growing mobile apps in the world, Truecaller sits at the center of your mobile phone experience helping you connect with the people who matter, in the way you want to communicate, while avoiding calls and texts from those you don’t. Google Duo is a simple video calling app that takes the complexity out of video calling. The service has been built to be fast and reliable, with a single button push for connecting with other users. Truecaller integration with Google Duo will be available in the coming months for Android and iOS as a permission-based service, where users will be able to opt-in and out at any time.

Today they introduce Google Local Inventory ads and explain how they can drive online traffic into your off line store: How Google “Local Inventory Ads” are redefining the consumer experience Nowadays, online and offline consumer journeys are considered to be worlds apart. Brick-and-mortar retail appears to have taken a back bench when it comes to progression, with retailers who previously relied on in-store sales having to go digital in order to keep up with the surging trends in the ecommerce industry. However, in-store sales remain the main source of revenue for many retailers. In order to live up to all-the-more demanding consumer expectations, online retailers need to follow suit and establish a brick-and-mortar presence. We can look to Amazon as an example. The online retail giant recently revolutionised the shopping experience with the creation of their first cash free convenience store. In order to continue evolving in the retail industry, the online and offline worlds need to join forces and establish a link that benefits consumers, providing them with the best shopping experiences possible. With this in mind, in 2013 Google launched their Local Inventory Ads (LIA) in the US and extended LIA to the UK in 2014. LIA is system that showcases products and store information to nearby shoppers searching with Google. From Online to In-Store In the UK alone, 39% of e-commerce transactions involve multiple devices in the path to purchase. Google takes advantage of this growing consumer trend through the multi-channel nature of LIA, recognising that consumers are increasingly using several devices in their buying journey. The integration of LIA into the Google Shopping platform allows retailers to to promote both online and in-store stock and increase their customer touch points. There are no longer any boundaries between online and in-store purchases, in fact, 82% of smartphone users say that they consult their phones on purchases they’re about to make in-store. So how does Google’s ‘in-store’ ads work? When a consumer is searching for an item, with LIA, a selection of products that correspond with their search will come up. Rather than just showing what is available online, consumers are directed to products that are available in stores in their vicinity. In one simple click, the user is taken to a Google-hosted ‘Local Storefront’ page which accesses the product sheet, checks the product price and availability, tracks the store location, maps the route and finally finds the opening hours and customer reviews. River Island was the first UK fashion brand to use Local Inventory Ads and they saw their return-on-spend rise by 15%, while a 33% increase in sales was observed when offline performance data was included. The incorporation of LIA into Google Shopping Ads brings a whole new dimension to the customer buying experience, creating a bridge between the growing demand for ‘local’ searches and mobile commerce. For retailers who rely on both online and in-store sales, LIA is an attractive feature charged on a CPC basis. Note that as a retailer, you can also use LIA even if you do not have an online store. Tackling the challenges of e-commerce There is a growing demand for immediate purchases with prompt delivery, which proves to be a challenge for online retailers. With this new advertising format, Google is responding to the demands for flexibility and immediacy that retailers need to implement in their stores, both online and off. A study by Google and Ipsos in 2014 revealed that consumers can be influenced to make an in-store purchase if they know that a store is nearby and that they can get the product quickly. LIA takes away the barrier of high delivery costs (74% of consumers abandon their baskets due to the cost of delivery), offering an alternative way for consumers to receive their products. Additionally, by diverting consumers to their physical stores, retailers can make up for financial losses incurred by having out of stock items online. Overall, this is a great opportunity to boost shop traffic, get additional sales, and avoid missing out on orders. An added bonus to using LIA is being able to offer consumers the option for last minute orders. Although the online retail market continues to evolve, unlike Amazon, the majority of market players are not equipped to manage last minute orders and guarantee same day delivery. The management of last minute orders is often considered essential in order to stand out in today’s market, however it requires significant investment and additional costs that not all market players can afford to set up. With the emergence of new consumer behaviour patterns, market players are obliged to constantly reevaluate and evolve their services in order to reach a wider audience. This can be through Google, but equally through Facebook as the social network now plays an interesting role in the ecommerce industry. In 2016 Facebook launched Dynamic Ads for Retail (in the United States), an advertising format similar to that of Google LIA. This reinforces the idea that the key to a successful multi-channel strategy lies in multiplying the number of marketing channels in order to give visibility to your entire product catalogue.
