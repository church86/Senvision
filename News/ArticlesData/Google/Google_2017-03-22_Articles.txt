Photographer: Liam Kidston. Margi MurphyThe Sun DID you know that Google has designed a glue that pedestrians will stick to in the case of a crash? The Sun reports it’s just one of the many futuristic — and questionable — inventions created by the biggest names in the industry. Forget the iPhone and the Galaxy S8, the likes of Apple, Samsung and Sony have a crack team creating devices that could be plucked from science fiction. But here are some of the strangest. GERM KILLER Smartphones are smothered in bacteria, and most of us are guilty of not cleaning them properly. Microsoft filed a patent in 2011 for an automatic smartphone disinfectant. It uses a UV light to disinfect the surface. Squeezable phones Samsung has designed a squeezy, stretchy phone and filed a patent for it in 2012. SONY’S SMART WIG The Japanese TV giants have designed a wig that can connect to your smartphone which vibrates when you receive calls.

MICROPHONE TATTOO If you can’t be bothered to hold your phone while you chat, Motorola filed a patent for a throat tattoo microphone in 2012. It means the vibrations of your larynx would be sent straight to the handset. GOOGLE’S EYE IMPLANT Google designed a lens that sits on the surface of the iris, bringing the smartphone menu right onto the eye itself. GOOGLE’S CAR GLUE A membrane of glue is coated onto the bonnet of cars to ensure that if a pedestrian was struck, they’d stick to the car, so as to catch them rather than strike them down.

Similarly, in 2012 Google filed a patent that will allow the front-facing camera to observe and read our expressions. It would know and recognise us specifically, and we could even unlock it by giving it a wink or a smile. ROBOT SKIN HP filed a patent to artificially create the sense of touch for robots — like a robotic skin. There’s been no word on when these technologies will get into our hands. But the patents, compiled by cash-for-gadgets site musicmagpie.co.uk, were all filed within the past eight years. This story first appeared on The Sun.

Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, said audio-only calls on Duo would be available from Wednesday in Brazil, and would be rolled out to users around the world in the coming days. The audio-only calls would work well on all connection speeds and be data efficient, Google Vice President for Product Management Mario Queiroz said in a blog post after he announced the moves at a Google conference in Sao Paulo. With more than 139 million people online, Brazil ranks among the top five internet populations in the world. In response to requests from users in countries like Brazil, Google said that Android users everywhere would be able to share documents and other files (.pdf, .docs, .apk, .zip, and mp3) with friends on Allo in group chats. It also said it was rolling out two new features for Google Photos on Android and iOS to make backup and sharing easier on low connectivity. “Now your photos will back up automatically in a lightweight preview quality that’s fast on 2G connections and still looks great on a smartphone,” Queiroz said in the blog post announcing the new features. When a stronger Wi-Fi connection becomes available, backed up photos would be replaced with high-quality versions, he added. Google also said it was adding a new location sharing feature in Google Maps to allow users to let friends and family know where they were and when they would arrive at their destination. Users can stop sharing that information at any time, Queiroz said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Smartphone device can test sperm quality Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Montblanc just launched a smartwatch — here’s why it matters China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Google could have three Pixel handsets in store for late 2017 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Is it time to say ‘goodbye’ to Google Allo?

Name: Subject: Message: You can thank Sony for some of the wireless audio improvements in Android O Newsby John Callaham11 hours ago 10 803 29 The first developer preview of Android O has a number of improvements when it comes to audio. However, Google didn’t come up with all of these new features on its own. The company has confirmed it got some help from its hardware partners. In fact one of them, Sony Mobile, helped Google to improve the wireless audio support for Android O. See also: Bluetooth audio just got a lot better with Android O 2 days ago A Google spokesperson told The Verge that Sony Mobile has “contributed more than 30 feature enhancements and 250 bug fixes” for Android O. Those improvements include adding the LDAC codec to Android O’s Bluetooth support. As we reported earlier this week, this codec will allow Android O to transfer up to 990 kbps of data, which should allow for a much better audio experience on Bluetooth-based wireless headphones. The catch to these updates is that other smartphone makers, as well as Bluetooth-based headphone companies, will still have to pay a licensing fee to Sony Mobile in order to let their devices use the more advanced LDAC codec in Android O. It remains to be seen if they will take that plunge. We have also discovered that Android O will support Qualcomm’s aptX and aptX-HD protocols for wireless audio, with the latter capable of offering 24-bit music quality for Bluetooth users.

LastPass has had to patch a flaw in one of its browser extensions that could have enabled hackers to steal passwords from users after visiting a malicious website. LastPass is a popular password manager which stores encrypted passwords in private accounts. It offers free and paid-for versions. Two vulnerabilities were found by seasoned security researcher Tavis Ormandy who works for Google's Project Zero. According to a security advisory posted by Ormandy, the flaw affecting the LastPass Chrome extension works by attacking an intermediary JavaScript code between a browser and LastPass' cloud service, which stores user passwords. “This script will proxy unauthenticated window messages to the extension. This is clearly a mistake,” he said in the advisory. “This allows complete access to internal privileged LastPass RPC commands. There are hundreds of internal LastPass RPCs, but the obviously bad ones are things copying and filling in passwords (copypass, fillform, etc).” Ormandy developed proof-of-concept code that launches an application (in this case Windows Calculator), via this JavaScript code. The code could be altered to steal user passwords before they are populated in the browser's username and password fields. “There are a lot of RPCs, allowing complete control of the LastPass extension, including stealing passwords. If you have the 'Binary Component' installed, this even allows arbitrary code execution,” added Ormandy. LastPass tweeted that it had already fixed the issue reported by the Google researcher and would publish further details later. A second bug affects LastPass's Firefox add-on version 3.3.2 only. According to Ormandy, this only affects LastPass' Firefox extension, version 3.3.2. As with the Chrome extension, the flaw can be exploited by malicious webpages to extract passwords from the manager. This version of the LastPass add-on is set to be retired by the firm. Ormandy has also found a similar bug in LastPass version 4.1.35 for Firefox. The researcher is gaining quite a reputation in finding bugs with LastPass. In July last year, he discovered a flaw in LastPass that allowed remote code execution.

But it won’t tell the world what’s inside. The company calls this new creation 3D XPoint—pronounced “three-dee cross-point”—and this week, after touting the stuff for a year-and-a-half, Intel finally pushed it into the market. You can think of the new technology as a computer building block that can serve more than one purpose—a single thing that can replace several others.

That’s probably why it won’t say what the memory is actually made of. Certainly, Intel doesn’t want others duplicating the technology, which it developed alongside hardware maker Micron. This chess game is worth watching because it could indeed change the way machines are built, most notably inside big internet companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These companies now build machines on a massive scale. They’re hardware markets unto themselves. And more than anyone else, they stand to benefit from Intel’s new technology. But a built-in tension exists here as well. Because they operate on such a scale, Google and Facebook don’t want their fate controlled by just one hardware supplier. They want choice, which brings efficiency by driving down prices. This dynamic is shaping the worldwide market for data center hardware. And Intel is pushing in the opposite direction. Traditionally, computers stored data in two ways. They stored most of it on hard drives, which could hold large amounts of information for long periods of time, even as machines were powered on and off—and do it pretty cheaply. But computers also used separate memory systems called DRAM to store the data they needed right now. This memory was much faster, but it was also more expensive and held less data. 3D XPoint can replace all those pieces—or so Intel says. “This is truly transformational,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich tells WIRED. “It allows architects—both at the PC level and the data center level—to rethink how they build the system.” Krzanich sees this technology redefining gaming machines and other personal computers. But that’s almost beside the point. A PC is a PC. Where this could really change things is inside the massive data centers operated by the internet’s biggest companies. As their online empires continue to grow, these companies always need faster and cheaper ways of storing ever-larger amounts of data. Over the past several years, they’ve already moved beyond hard drives to significantly faster flash solid state drives, or SSDs. Since even these drives aren’t fast enough in some cases, they’ve created a new breed of database that pushes massive amounts of data into memory. 3D XPoint could help in both those areas. According to Intel, it’s about 1,000 times faster than flash and can store about 10 times more data than DRAM. What Goes Inside But right now, neither of those numbers really apply. On Sunday, Intel released the first 3D XPoint product, a storage device marketed under the name Optane that can replace hard drives or flash SSDs. But this device is only about five times faster than flash SSDs—not 1,000—because of the standard interface that connects the drive to the rest of the machine. Eventually, Intel will offer products that plug straight into the heart of the machine, removing this bottleneck, but that won’t happen until at least the second half of the year. RELATED: Microsoft and Intel’s Decades-Long Alliance Has Started To Fray When that happens, the likes of Google and Facebook really could build new kinds of systems—systems that can hold data in memory even when powered down, that merge memory and storage or mix and match them in new ways—all in an effort to create vast networks of machines that can more efficiently juggle information. This is no small undertaking. If they significantly reorganize their hardware, they must also rewrite their operating systems and other software to accommodate the changes. According Krzanich, Intel is already working with “almost all of the big cloud service providers” to explore these possibilities. These companies, he says, have been testing sample hardware since early last year. Still, so many questions remain. Intel now says that 3D XPoint is only about one percent as fast as DRAM. Even if that improves, says Jim Handy, an analyst with Objective Analysis who follows the memory and storage markets, the technology only makes sense as memory if it’s significantly cheaper than DRAM. Whether it will be remains unclear. It’s also unclear when Intel will allow this technology to plug straight into processors offered by competitors—though Krzanich indicates it will. “We will always have options that can fix with anybody’s architecture,” he says. “With something as ubiquitous as memory, you’ve got to have it work with everybody.” What Krzanich does make clear is that Intel will not sell raw 3D XPoint memory to anyone else. “We won’t sell this in any other form but a finished product,” he says. Today, Intel is one of so many companies that sell flash, and that means its opportunities are slim. It wants to build a market for 3D XPoint where other options are scarce. Will the internet giants embrace that kind of arrangement? It’s an important question. As Google, Amazon, and Microsoft expand their cloud computing businesses, offering services where others can set up their own online empires without buying their own hardware, these internet giants will account for more and more of the worldwide hardware market. Increasingly, these are the main customers for parts suppliers such as Intel. In 2012, Intel vice president Diane Bryant told WIRED that Google bought more server chips from Intel than all but about four other companies. As Krzanich points out, Micron will also sell 3D XPoint hardware. So some competition will exist, eventually. And others are developing alternatives. It’s possible competition will push down prices, and the internet’s biggest companies will bite. But for now, the dance goes on to decide what really winds up inside.

The Mountain View tech titan is going to give Google Maps users the power to share their location with friends and colleagues. The sharing will work from both Android and Apple iOS mobile operating systems, Google said March 22. “And the people you share with will be able to see your location on Android, iPhone, mobile web, and even desktop,” Google Maps engineering manager Daniel Resnick said in a blog post. “Whenever you want to let someone know where you are, just open the side menu or tap the blue dot that represents where you are. Tap ‘share location’ and then select who(m) to share with and how long to share — and you’re done! “The people you’ve chosen to share with will see you on their map.” Imagine how helpful this service would be at a huge, crowded event such as a music festival or a major tech conference, and how many phone calls or text messages you wouldn’t have to make or send while wrangling a group of friends together for drinks-before-dinner. Of course, what’s good for users has got to be good for Google, and this addition to the Maps experience will bring a wealth of valuable data to the company, which it can use for selling targeted ads. “It’s a convenient feature that not so coincidentally makes it way more likely you’ll spend a lot more time within Google’s map ecosystem,” Wired magazine reported. “The unspoken hope is that all this good stuff will keep you tethered to the friendly blue-n-white interface, and churn out information on the way you move.” Google said it would roll the service out worldwide “soon.”   Photo: Google’s new logo near the Googleplex on Charleston Road in Mountain View in 2015.  (Nhat V.

Just like we saw with Google Photos, Google Duo is also receiving some love to better accommodate slower network conditions. Debuting over a year ago (wow, time flies) Google’s video calling app will soon add one of its most user requested features: audio-only calls. This is a Brazil-only exclusive, at least for today, but Google says audio-only calls will eventually roll out worldwide “in the coming days.” So no matter where you live, you’ll be able to place VOIP calls using Duo without having to worry about your makeup. It’s a pretty nice feature to have and comes standard on messaging apps like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. We’re just wondering what took Google so long.

Digital Trends Home > Web > ‘Googling’ a certain name could get… ‘Googling’ a certain name could get you caught up in a police investigation By Jon Martindale — March 20, 2017 8:00 AM Share Strada Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you While this warrant may not hold up if challenged, it goes to show that it can be easy to get caught up in investigations. If you performed a Google search for the name of Douglas [redacted] then a warrant issued by a Minnesota judge could well apply to you. In a case that has drawn concern from analysts over its broad reach, the judge issued a warrant that covered anyone who searched for a certain name on Google, in an attempt to help police track down a passport forger. According to the warrant, the case targets a person who used a fake passport to enable the transfer of $28,500 from a Spire Credit Union to a Bank of America account. When investigators searched Google for the victim of fraud, they discovered the image used on the faux passport was available through Google images. While we know the victim’s first name is Douglas, the surname has been redacted from the warrant. Although the warrant request was filed within the township of Edina in Minnesota, its reach is potentially unlimited, meaning anyone who searched for that person’s name between December 1, 2016 and January 7, 2017, could have their details handed over to the police. More: Wikileaks: Government was spying on you using phones, computers, even smart TVs Those details include everything Google has to hand, too. That includes IP addresses, MAC addresses, names, addresses, telephone numbers, date of birth, email address, payment information, and social security numbers. It’s not clear at this time whether Google would comply with such a warrant. It has previously rejected an administrative subpoena that attempted to force its hand in a similar manner. The Register highlights how the firm has refused to cooperate with some requests in the past and has a vested interest in protecting the identities of its users. It did release a generic statement in request for comment, saying that it would “always push back when [it received] excessively broad requests for data about [its] users.” There is also the question of whether such a warrant is even legally viable under Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. However, the harvesting of mass data in what is often described as “dragnet” information-gathering tactics by law enforcement and intelligence agencies has become far more commonplace in recent years. Indeed 2017 will be an important year when it comes to this issue, as many politicians and lobby groups hope to force Congress to allow the special provisions in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to expire.

The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars. YouTube's popularity stems from its massive and eclectic library of video, spanning everything from polished TV clips to raw diatribes posted by people bashing homosexuals. But that diverse selection periodically allows ads to appear next to videos that marketers find distasteful, despite Google's efforts to prevent it from happening. Google depends largely on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. Earlier this week, Google vowed to step up its efforts to block ads on "hateful, offensive and derogatory" videos. "We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us," Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, wrote in a Tuesday blog post. As part of Google's solution to the problem, Schindler promised to hire "significant numbers" of employees to review YouTube videos and flag them as inappropriate for ads. He also predicted YouTube would be able to address advertisers' concerns through Google's recent advancements in artificial intelligence technology parlance for computers that learn to think like humans. But that promise so far hasn't appeased AT&T, Verizon Communications and an expanding global list of advertisers that includes Volkswagen, Audi, HSBC Holdings, the Royal Bank of Scotland and L'Oreal. "We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate," AT&T said in a statement. "Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms." By extending its ban to everything beyond Google's search results, AT&T is also effectively pulling its ads from more than two million other websites that depend on Google to deliver ads to their pages. In its statement, Verizon said it decided to pull ads from YouTube to protect its website while it investigates the "weak links" among its digital advertising partners. Both AT&T and Verizon may have an ulterior motive to make YouTube look like an untrustworthy spot for marketers because both companies are trying to sell more digital ads in their own networks. YouTube has become one of the fastest growing parts of Google's ad system, which generated USD 79 billion in revenue last year. Google doesn't disclose how much of that came from YouTube ads, but the research firm eMarketer estimated that the video site accounted for USD 5.6 billion that amount. EMarketer projected YouTube's advertising will rise 26 per cent this year to USD 7 billion, but that prediction came before marketers began to suspend their spending.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Don't throw the box away: Smartphone… Don't throw the box away: Smartphone packaging may transform into a VR viewer By Kyle Wiggers — March 20, 2017 9:52 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Rather than discard your new phone's packaging, Google envisions a better use for it as a VR headset. Google’s made no secret of its ambitions to carve out a slice of the virtual reality market. It’s shipped more than 10 million of its low-cost Cardboard devices for smartphones and launched its high-end Daydream platform in 2016. A new patent from the search giant, though, envisions a far more scalable solution: device packaging that can double as a VR viewer. The patent in question, “Integrated mobile device packaging and virtual reality headset,” was originally filed in February 2016 and describes a box that folds along perforated lines into a headset. It’s constructed from cardboard and heavy paper stock, held together with a combination of glue and tape, and packs a pair of lenses — one for each eye. More: YouTube wants to make it “chocolate rain” in VR Road to VR speculates it could be related to new Google job postings for a VR engineer, lead product designer, and hardware validation manager. In 2016, Engadget reported Google was working on a VR headset that “[integrates] eye-tracking and [uses] sensors and algorithms to map out the real-world space in front of a user.” The project was said to be “separate from the company’s Daydream VR platform.” Google is not the first to integrate a VR viewer into packaging — McDonald’s, for example, recently shipped a Happy Meal box that folded into “Happy Goggles” — but VR-equipped box align’s with the company’s broader mission of attracting “hundreds of millions of [Android] users” to VR. At Google’s I/O development conference in 2016, it announced plans to build a “multi-billion dollar business” out of Daydream, a VR platform that combines a motion controller, flagship hardware, and software from hundreds of partners to deliver a “premium” virtual reality experience. “The hope is that if in five years we’re collectively working on another frontier technology, that we can look back and say again that we’ve created value [with Daydream],” Brahim Elbouchikhi, senior product manager on the Google VR team, said at I/O. “[Our] intention is to operate at Android scale.” More: Google wants to show off your face a bit better in VR and mixed reality To that end, Google’s VR efforts extend beyond hardware. In February, Google’s Research division showed off a project that leverages 3D computer vision, machine learning, green screen technology, and advanced rendering methods to show a person’s facial expressions inside a mixed reality environment. And in March, YouTube announced it is working to make 360-degree and VR video “better” with improved rendering technologies that “display [content] without using more bandwidth than necessary.”

Android Anna Scantlin Contributing Editor | March 22, 2017 1 shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0               Yesterday, Google announced the first developer preview of Android O. The build is, of course, in very early days and nowhere near completion, but the fact that Google is openly working on the next big version of Android is exciting, nonetheless. As I went through the changes that are currently known to come with Android O, I couldn’t help but think of changes that I hope to see come final release. The one feature that I’m really hoping to see is actually something that I hope comes to both Android and iOS in the near future: a native dark theme. As a Galaxy S7 Edge user, I’ve lucked out in the sense that one of Samsung’s many features includes themes. I have a handful of free themes that I’ve downloaded, all of which are dark themes – a welcome change from the bright whites of the menus and notifications in Marshmallow and Nougat. Between themes and Good Lock – which no longer works with the S7 in Nougat, and won’t until the release of the S8 – I’ve successfully given my S7 Edge a “dark theme” without having to do too much. However, the process could still be easier. Much like the implementation of Night Mode, which enables users to toggle their blue light filter on or off for nighttime viewing that’s easier on the eyes, I consider the option for a system-wide dark theme toggle equally as important. I’m surprised it hasn’t been implemented yet. It’s a feature that’s been requested time and time again. I’m no developer, but I’m positive that it’s feasible. The option was even teased in early builds of both Marshmallow and Nougat, but scrapped by the final release. Here’s hoping that it’s implemented – and kept – in Android O. On Apple's side of things, Dark Mode, which turns menu bars a dark color, has been an option on Macs since Yosemite. Another option that’s worth exploring (for Android, at least) is to natively offer themes. For years users have relied on third-party launchers to provide these services, but even launchers have their limitations. For instance, launcher themes can’t change the colors of system menus and settings, making a dark theme inconsistent across the device. Having system-wide themes natively implemented would solve this issue. iOS, I’ve since discovered, isn’t much better. Ever since I first owned an iPhone, I felt that a dark theme option would really improve the experience for me. iOS has an accessibility option that inverts colors, essentially giving the device a “dark” theme, but is clearly meant for accessibility purposes only and not for people who simply want a darker theme across their iPhone. Simply put, a simple native dark theme option should be available across platforms. Currently there are ways to force phones to have a dark theme, but it takes some work to get there. I’m still in the boat that simple native option would be preferable. I like tinkering with my phone and making it look just the way I like it as much as anyone, but in regards to a dark theme, a quick toggle between a preset light/dark theme would make this girl’s retinas very happy.

Ramlee on his 88th birthday by giving him a Doodle. The March 22 Doodle shows him the way people remembered him best: sporting a thin moustache and wearing a checkered suit, his head cocked slightly to the side. In the Doodle, the Penang-born icon, who was born Teuku Zakaria Teuku Nyak Puti, is holding a film script in his left hand and a megaphone in his right. A guitar is leaning against the director's chair that he is sitting on. A Google Doodle is a special, temporary alteration of the logo on Google's homepage that is intended to celebrate holidays, events, achievements and people. P. Ramlee's artistic achievements won over countless hearts and left an indelible mark on the cultural history of Malaysia. He was a prolific actor, director, writer and musician who contributed to more than 60 films such as Bujang Lapok and Ibu Mertua Ku. He also composed around 250 songs, including the evergreen Getaran Jiwa. P. Ramlee was the recipient of various awards at the Asian Film Festival, such as Best Male Actor (Anakku Sazali, 1957), Best Comedy (Madu Tiga, 1964; Nujum Pak Belalang, 1960; Pendekar Bujang Lapok, 1959) and Best Musical Score (Hang Tuah, 1956). He died of a heart attack at 44 and was buried at the Jalan Ampang Muslim Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur. After his death in 1973, Malaysians kept his legacy alive by honouring him with posthumous awards and naming halls, museums and buildings after him.

See Offers Business Posted Yesterday at 8:24 PM increase font size Major advertisers boycott YouTube AT&T, Verizon and others say their ads had appeared alongside unsavory video on the Google-owned site. Associated Press Share Comment Read Article SAN FRANCISCO — AT&T, Verizon and several other major advertisers are suspending their marketing campaigns on Google’s YouTube site after discovering their brands have been appearing alongside videos promoting terrorism and other unsavory subjects. The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars. YouTube’s popularity stems from its massive and eclectic library of video, spanning everything from polished TV clips to raw diatribes posted by people bashing homosexuals. But that diverse selection periodically allows ads to appear next to videos that marketers find distasteful, despite Google’s efforts to prevent it from happening. Google depends largely on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. Earlier this week, Google vowed to step up its efforts to block ads on “hateful, offensive and derogatory” videos. “We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a Tuesday blog post. As part of Google’s solution to the problem, Schindler promised to hire “significant numbers” of employees to review YouTube videos and flag them as inappropriate for ads. He also predicted YouTube would be able to address advertisers’ concerns through Google’s recent advancements in artificial intelligence – technology parlance for computers that learn to think like humans. But that promise so far hasn’t appeased AT&T, Verizon Communications and an expanding global list of advertisers that includes Volkswagen, Audi, HSBC Holdings, the Royal Bank of Scotland and L’Oreal. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” AT&T said in a statement. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” By extending its ban to everything beyond Google’s search results, AT&T is also effectively pulling its ads from more than 2 million other websites that depend on Google to deliver ads to their pages. Verizon said it decided to pull ads from YouTube to protect its website while it investigates the “weak links” among its digital advertising partners. AT&T and Verizon are trying to sell more digital ads in their own networks. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Name: Subject: Message: The next version of Chrome will add support for fullscreen Progressive Web Apps Newsby John Callaham12 hours ago 2 360 11 Android users will soon get a new version of Google’s Chrome web browser. Chrome 58, which is currently available in Google’s beta channel, will of course have a number of improvements and one of them should offer a better way to view Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in the browser. See also: Best Android browsers January 3, 2017 As detailed on the company’s Chromium blog, the current stable version of Chrome launches PWAs, but they still show the typical system bars when they run inside the browser. This could be annoying when these kinds of apps are running videos or are game-based apps, where you would like to ditch those bars. Chrome 58 will let PWAs get rid of those system bars, due to giving app developers the ability to add the “display: fullscreen” option in their web app manifest. In addition to adding fullscreen PWAs, Google says Chrome 58 will be able to fully support the IndexedDB 2.0 standard, which it says should make it easier for users to work with large data sets in the browser. Also, developers will be able to use the new iframe sandbox keyword “allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation”. This will be handy for web developers who want to put in third-party content, such as ads, inside sandboxed iframes. Chrome 58 should be released in the stable channel sometime in late April or early May, but if you want you can download the beta version right now in the Google Play Store.

Google Maps is soon getting real-time location sharing abilities. This new feature will be rolling out worldwide to all of its users on Android and iOS. When you get access to it, you'll be able to quickly share your current whereabouts with anyone you want, for as long as you want. This works for trips too, so you can basically share your progress on your way to your friend's house, with an ETA included. It's all explained neatly in the promotional video below, which focuses on a surprise birthday party. So, to share your location either go to the new option in the side menu in Google Maps for Android or iOS, or tap the blue dot that represents where you are. Then you select who to share with and for how long. If the people you share with aren't Google contacts, you can send them a special link through any messaging app you want. While you're sharing your location, the people you've chosen will see you on their map. In your Google Maps app there will be an icon above the compass reminding you that you're actively sharing your location. You can stop sharing at any time. When you're navigating somewhere, you can tap More on the bottom of the screen and choose Share trip. People you share this with will be able to follow your journey on their map. Trip sharing automatically ends when you reach your destination.

Here’s our review of it, where Jake notes that apps freeze if they’re not in the foreground. Which is a good reminder: Android apps on tablets have never really been very good. They usually end up feeling like stretched-out phone apps. Things have gotten better in the past couple years, but it’s still a problem. In fact, it has always been a problem. I wonder if anybody ever told Google that it was a problem and it should try to do a better job incentivizing developers to make apps that work better on tablets. Oh, wait, somebody has: Motorola Xoom review, 2011: There is a ton of promise on the software side for tablets running Honeycomb given the new access to 3D tools and system tweaking that Android allows, but right now it's a small island in a sea of phone titles -- and the majority of those titles do not look right on a 10.1-inch screen at this resolution. Motorola Xyboard review, 2011: Tablet-friendly apps are still few and far between — even the big Twitter web and app overhaul didn't include any optimizations for larger form factors — and it does seem like everyone's waiting for ICS to arrive before investing too heavily in redeveloping software. Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 review, 2012: Ice Cream Sandwich may have improved the core Android tablet experience, but it doesn't solve the OS's biggest problem: the glaring lack of good, tablet-optimized apps for Android. The number of tablet-friendly apps is certainly increasing, but it's still far too low, and most of the apps you download will still be blown-up phone apps Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 review, 2012: Unfortunately, the list of great and useful tablet apps is otherwise still too small, especially compared to the huge ecosystem of 9.7-inch apps designed and optimized for the iPad. Android has a handful of good apps — games in particular — but you're still going to be dealing primarily with upscaled phone apps that don't look very good on a 10-inch screen. Nexus 7 review, 2012: While Google’s new OS and latest app initiatives are very, very good, Android on tablets still suffers from an incredible lack of developer support. Mainstream apps like Twitter have yet to be updated to an appropriate tablet-friendly design, while others, like Pocket, seem to be slightly optimized but not working 100 percent correctly. Some apps simply aren’t optimized for the tablet in any way. The Android 4.1 SDK is now available to developers, so hopefully that’ll be changing soon. Nexus 10 review, 2012: The Nexus 10 feels like Google's open letter to developers. "Look how great Android tablets can be," the company seems to be saying, "if only you'd make great apps!" [...] Apple's tablet has 250,000-plus other apps that look and work great on a huge, high-res screen, and Android's ecosystem is leagues behind. [...] Google's now proven conclusively that it can design great Android hardware, but until developers prove they can design great Android software it's still hard to recommend the Nexus 10 over an iPad. Nexus 7 2013 review, 2013: For three months, Google's been talking a lot about tablets. At I/O in June and again this week, it talked about the special section in the Play Store designed just for tablet apps, and the new tools for developers. It's about time, too, because though Android has made huge progress it's still not up to par with the iOS app selection. More and more apps I use are available on Android, but too many are still just blown-up phone apps, and there are still plenty of games and great apps (Paper and Djay come to mind) simply missing. Google's catching up, but it started the race way too late. Nexus 9 review, 2014: Though many of Google’s own apps are designed to work well on tablets, the vast majority of third-party apps in the Google Play Store still look ridiculous on such a large screen. For all that Google has done to improve the hardware on its Android tablets, the app situation is where Apple still has the farthest lead, and the Nexus 9 and Lollipop do nothing to close that gap. Pixel C review, 2015: One big problem is that most of the apps I use on Android tablets still aren’t truly optimized for tablets. Most apps are comprised of wide, wasted expanses of open space that are technically designed for any screen size but actually aren’t utilizing all this screen real estate. That’s problematic with third-party apps, but it’s unforgivable from Google’s own apps. Hangouts, the perennial forgotten child of Mountain View, is a mess on this device. Nvidia Shield review, 2016: And, at least until Google sorts out serious multitasking for its OS, eight inches is the right size for an Android tablet. It’s big enough to offer a meaningfully different experience over even a giant phone like the Nexus 6P, but small enough to mitigate the fact that Android still just doesn’t feel all that great on a tablet. You’re still dealing with stretched-out phone apps, but at least on the Shield they’re not blown up to the ridiculous degree that you’d see on something like the Pixel C. Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 review, 2017: Even though Android still doesn’t have the tablet app selection that iOS does, I was able to run basically everything I needed to on the Tab S3, including work apps like Trello and Slack to more powerful sketching apps like Adobe Draw. I was able to keep up two apps at once. And I was able to research and publish articles to this website without major issue. But unfortunately, multitasking is still far from elegant, and it's what separates this device the most from a "real" computer. One issue I ran into immediately: even though Slack supports multitasking, the app only pulled in new messages when I was engaged with it; if I tapped on the other app I was running alongside it, Slack would sit idle and refuse to show new messages that were added to the conversation until I tapped on it. Maybe when Android apps on Chrome OS come out of beta and are widely available in every classroom that uses a Chromebook, that’ll be the incentive that’s been missing to get developers to create Android apps that work well on large screens. Maybe Android tablet apps will be better this year. Next Up In TL;DR Lego’s new Star Wars Rebel Snowspeeder is a work of beauty Is sharing fake news okay if it feels right?

Google, owned by Alphabet Inc , said audio-only calls on Duo would be available from Wednesday in Brazil, and would be rolled out to users around the world in the coming days. The audio-only calls would work well on all connection speeds and be data efficient, Google Vice President for Product Management Mario Queiroz said in a blog post after he announced the moves at a Google conference in Sao Paulo. With more than 139 million people online, Brazil ranks among the top five internet populations in the world. In response to requests from users in countries like Brazil, Google said that Android users everywhere would be able to share documents and other files (.pdf, .docs, .apk, .zip, and mp3) with friends on Allo in group chats. It also said it was rolling out two new features for Google Photos on Android and iOS to make backup and sharing easier on low connectivity. "Now your photos will back up automatically in a lightweight preview quality that's fast on 2G connections and still looks great on a smartphone," Queiroz said in the blog post announcing the new features. When a stronger Wi-Fi connection becomes available, backed up photos would be replaced with high-quality versions, he added. Google also said it was adding a new location sharing feature in Google Maps to allow users to let friends and family know where they were and when they would arrive at their destination. Users can stop sharing that information at any time, Queiroz said.

The new OS is designed to improve on battery life and interactive performance of devices, according to Dave Burke, vice president of engineering (Android) at Google. The new release puts automatic limits on what applications do in the background in three areas: implicit broadcasts, background services and location updates. Updated developer previews will become available in the coming months, and devs will get a more detailed look at the OS at Google I/O, to be held this May at the company's Mountain View, Calfornia, headquarters. Background limits represent a significant change in how Android operates, so it's important to give developers time to get used to the new features, Burke said. The release is still in its early stages, he cautioned, noting that there are additional features in the works, and plenty of stabilization and performance work to be completed. "Background limits illustrates how Google is moving ahead to improve battery life on Android devices, and support for new/emerging WiFi functions and specs highlight the company's efforts to stay on the leading edge of device connectivity," observed Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. Another major new feature is picture-in-picture display for phones and tablets, which allows users to watch a video while they are separately engaged in a chat session or hailing a car ride, for example. Sound Quality The new OS includes major improvement in connectivity, with support for LDAC, which is Sony's new high-quality wireless audio via Bluetooth. Additional WiFi features include WiFi Aware, which allows WiFi access without an Internet access point, a service previously known as "Neighborhood Awareness Networking." The new release includes notification channels, which give developers "fine grained control" over various types of notifications and let users individually block or change channel behaviors such as sound, vibration or level of importance. Notification channels let users control an app's notification categories. Google has seen a resurgence in keyboard navigation with the advent of Google Play apps on Chrome OS, Burke noted. The new OS therefore includes a feature that stabilizes arrow and tab navigation, both for developers and end users. The O Developer Preview has an updated SDK with system images available so it can be previewed on the official Android Emulator and on Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel, Pixel XL and Pixel C. An emulator is also available for wearables, including Android Wear 2.0 and Android O. Adaptive icons display in a variety of shapes across different device models. The initial release is not available for consumer use, and is available only via manual download and flash, Google said. As the final release date draws closer, Google will open up consumer enrollments through Android Beta. While most of the features are designed to ease developer processes, features like support for picture-in-picture are aimed at improving the user experience, Pund-IT's King told LinuxInsider. Google's objective, in part, is to boost the level of consumer acceptance of the new OS, King said, noting that the latest Android version, Nougat, is installed only on a small fraction of Android devices. Two-thirds of Android devices are running OS 6.0 or earlier versions, by some estimates. App Innovations Ahead? Google is pushing hard to gain consumer acceptance, as only 3 percent of Android devices are running Nougat and only 31 percent are running Marshmallow, said Karol Severin, an analyst at Midia Research. Older operating systems account for the remaining share of the market. The early announcement will give the developers some time to make sure they can build apps with additional functionality and make sure older apps are running smoothly on the new OS, Severin said. "Google will be making sure that its own devices get the updates fast," he told LinuxInsider. "If the OS is received well within the Google device community, it can either differentiate its user experience from lagging Android handset manufacturers and win some smartphone marketshare in the process, or it will act a nudge to other handset manufacturers to speed up their OS update processes."

Throughout 2017, Google plans to improve regular security updates for Android, streamlining the process so that manufacturers can send patches and updates out in a more timely manner across devices, according to Android Security Team's own Adrian Ludwig and Mel Miller. This move not only means a more consistent schedule for security updates, but helps Android mend its reputation for slow updates (as seen in the less-than-expedient release of Android Nougat) compared to its chief rival, Apple, which benefits from quicker, platform-wide updates thanks to its closed platform.  Google also hopes its advances in machine learning will make it even more proactive at stopping cyber ne'er-do-wells, saying such technology can "significantly" improve its catch rate of harmful apps both inside and outside the Google Play Store. Lessons learned Android beefed up security this past year using several new features such as Smart Lock, Safe Browsing, and Google-backed security APIs for third-party developers, according to Google's main report.  From 2015-2016, Android's own Verify Apps feature claims to have dropped the amount of malicious activities via Google Play Store apps to all-time lows. This included lowering install rates of trojans by over 50% to just 0.016% of installs among the tech giant's 1.4 billion-strong user base.  Backdoors and unauthorized loaders were also down, making up less than even a hundredth of a percent of installs in 2016. Phishing apps took an especially hard hit, down over 70% the previous year to an install rate of 0.0018%. Google boasts that by the end of 2016 only 0.05% of devices that downloaded apps exclusively from the Google Play Store had software that was potentially harmful, down from 0.15% in 2015.   Curious to learn more?

Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article Verizon said it discovered its ads were appearing on ‘non-sanctioned websites,’ and that it takes ‘careful measures to ensure our brand is not impacted negatively.’ — Reuters pic LONDON, March 23 — AT&T and Verizon yesterday joined global firms pulling ads from Google, saying they did not want their brands associated with inappropriate content on the internet giant. The moves by the two US telecom giants came despite a pledge by Google this week to offer new tools for companies to avoid placing ads alongside undesirable websites or videos. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” an emailed statement from AT&T said, indicating it was removing non-search ads from Google. Verizon said it discovered its ads were appearing on “non-sanctioned websites,” and that it takes “careful measures to ensure our brand is not impacted negatively.” A Verizon spokeswoman said in an email: “We took immediate action to suspend this type of ad placement and launched an investigation. We are working with all of our digital advertising partners to understand the weak links so we can prevent this from happening in the future.” The announcements follow similar actions from the British arm of Havas, one of the world’s top advertising agencies, as well as banking giant HSBC, retailer Marks & Spencer, the BBC and the Guardian newspaper group. On Monday, Google apologised for the placement of ads on extremist content and pledged it would address the concerns. “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values,” Google’s chief business officer Philipp Schindler said in a blog post. Asked about the latest actions, Google said in a statement to AFP it did not comment on specific customers but noted that “we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear.” The company added that it is “raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.” The boycott began last week after the Times newspaper of London found BBC programmes were promoted alongside videos posted by American white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke as well as videos by Wagdi Ghoneim, an Islamist preacher banned from Britain for inciting hatred. The analysis found more than 200 anti-Semitic videos, and that Google failed to remove six of them within the 24-hour period mandated by the EU when it anonymously signalled their presence. The British government subsequently put its YouTube advertising on hold on Monday, saying in a statement, “it is totally unacceptable that taxpayer-funded advertising has appeared next to inappropriate internet content — and that message was conveyed very clearly to Google.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Bank Negara sees economy, exports growing faster in 2017 S.Korea throws shipbuilder Daewoo new US$6b lifeline Jack Ma optimistic about introducing Alipay e-wallet service in Malaysia Bursa Malaysia remains above 1,750 at mid-afteroon Ringgit to stabilise gradually, no more large outflow Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 China capital controls leave buyers of foreign property in bind (VIDEO) Jack Ma to launch Alibaba’s regional distribution hub in Malaysia, sources say Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Google apologises to ad clients for YouTube content fiasco Facebook tunes trending topics to better deliver news Google moves to restrict ads on fake news sites Google announces updates to its app and video ad functions Instagram attracts more advertising than Twitter, survey finds Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
X Close Nation Home > News > Nation < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 23 March 2017 Google Doodle does P. Ramlee as 88th birthday tribute PETALING JAYA: Google paid tri­bute to the late Tan Sri P. Ramlee on his 88th birthday by giving him a Doodle. The Doodle shows him the way people remembered him best: sporting a thin moustache and wearing a checkered suit, his head cocked slightly to the side. In the Doodle, the Penang-born icon, who was born Teuku Zakaria Teuku Nyak Puti, is holding a film script in his left hand and a megaphone in his right. A guitar is leaning against the director’s chair that he is sitting on. A Google Doodle is a special, temporary alteration of the logo on Google’s homepage that is intended to celebrate holidays, events, achievements and people. P. Ramlee’s artistic achievements won over countless hearts and left an indelible mark on the cultural history of Malaysia. He was a prolific actor, director, writer and musician who contribu­ted to more than 60 films such as Bujang Lapok and Ibu Mertua Ku. He also composed around 250 songs, including the evergreen Getaran Jiwa. P. Ramlee was the recipient of various awards at the Asian Film Festival, such as Best Male Actor (Anakku Sazali, 1957), Best Comedy (Madu Tiga, 1964; Nujum Pak Belalang, 1960; Pendekar Bujang Lapok, 1959) and Best Musical Score (Hang Tuah, 1956). He died of a heart attack at 44 and was buried at the Jalan Am­pang Muslim Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur. After his death in 1973, Malay­sians kept his legacy alive by ho­nouring him with posthumous awards and naming halls, mu­­seums and buildings after him.

Today, the popular app is getting real-time location sharing, allowing users to temporarily let friends or family keep tabs on their whereabouts. You can let someone know an ETA to an appointment, for example, or if you’ll just feel safer coming home late knowing that your loved ones can keep track of where you are. Whenever you want to let someone know where you are, just open the side menu or tap the blue dot that represents where you are. Tap “Share location”, select who to share with and for how long. The time interval ranges from 15 minutes to 3 days, or you can choose to share “Until you turn it off” — the person you’re sharing with needs to be in your Google contacts for this, otherwise it’s time-restricted only. Maps will share a link via your preferred messaging app to your contacts, which they can load on Google Maps to see your location or monitor your trip progress if you choose the "Share trip" option. The feature will work on Android, iPhone, and mobile or desktop web browsers. Your can reciprocate and share their location back to you too, but it’s not mandatory. Google notes that you'll always know when you're sharing your location with someone via an icon above the compass on your map, and you always have the option of ending sharing whenever you want. "Our goal is guiding and assisting users in the real world everyday," says Jen Fitzpatrick, the Vice President of Google Maps. "We're stretching people's perceptions on what maps can do for them, and the real world tasks that we can help them with." Other recent updates to Maps have added the ability to remember where you parked, find reviews for nearby restaurants and more.

Head to chrome://flags and you'll find dozens of potentially upcoming features in many stages of development. Since they aren't ready to be on by default, it goes without saying that your mileage may vary when enabling them. Google warns that your browser might delete your data and your security could be compromised. It's not unheard of for flags to cause browser crashes or blue screens, though some are inevitably riskier than others. With that said, we've tried to pick a handful of flags that seem relatively safe and yet useful to the average Chrome install. If this isn't adventurous enough for you or if you don't want to risk your main install, Google also provides a beta build of its browser with some new features as well as Chrome Canary, which is updated almost every day. #enable-fast-unload | Fast tab/window close When enabled, this feature reduces the amount of time it takes for a tab to disappear when you close it. Although it doesn't actually end the process any faster, the tab will close instantly while the process finishes being shut down in the background, making for a more fluid experience. Available for: Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, Android #automatic-tab-discarding | Automatic tab discarding Chrome is notorious for its ability to consume memory and even machines with 8GB of RAM might run low with heavy usage. If this is an issue on your PC, you might benefit from automatic tab discarding, which removes tabs from the system memory when it starts running low. Discarded tabs are still shown in-browser and are reloaded when clicked. Available for: Windows, Mac Also see: Make Chrome Run Faster and Keep RAM Usage Under Control #enable-tab-audio-muting | Tab audio muting UI control Back in 2013 Chrome announced a new feature that displays an audio icon on tabs that are making noise. This flag allows you to mute/unmute the sound coming from a tab by clicking on that audio icon. Available for: Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome OS #enable-scroll-anchoring | Scroll anchoring There are few things more frustrating while browsing than going to click a link and having it move as the web page finishes loading. This flag will prevent pages from skipping around as they load so you never misclick on another ad. Available for: Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, Android #enable-gpu-rasterization | GPU Rasterization Offloads page rendering from your CPU to your GPU, which arguably makes this a higher risk/potentially lower reward feature depending on what you do online. Graphics-heavy content is likely to see a performance boost and you can check this for yourself with the in-browser frame counter found in the developer tools: Ctrl + Shift + J > Console Drawer > 3-dot menu > Rendering > FPS meter. Available for: Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, Android (#num-raster-threads may also be of interest) Bonus round: Hidden T-rex dinosaur game On the subject of hidden features, did you know that Chrome has an offline T-rex mini-game? The next time you see a connection error screen (chrome://network-error/-106), hit the space bar or up arrow to begin a sidescrolling jump game with a T-rex hurdling cacti and pterodactyls. Your progress and high score is tracked but lost when the window is closed or refreshed. 5 days, 5 killer tech tips is a TechSpot monthly feature On the third week of every month, we'll publish 5 killer tech tips, one for each day of the week for a given app, service, or platform.

The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars. YouTube’s popularity stems from its massive and eclectic library of video, spanning everything from polished TV clips to raw diatribes posted by people bashing homosexuals. But that diverse selection periodically allows ads to appear next to videos that marketers find distasteful, despite Google’s efforts to prevent it from happening. Advertisement Continue reading Google depends largely on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. Earlier this week, Google vowed to step up its efforts to block ads on “hateful, offensive and derogatory” videos. “We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a Tuesday blog post. As part of Google’s solution to the problem, Schindler promised to hire “significant numbers” of employees to review YouTube videos and flag them as inappropriate for ads. He also predicted YouTube would be able to address advertisers’ concerns through Google’s recent advancements in artificial intelligence — technology parlance for computers that learn to think like humans. But that promise so far hasn’t appeased AT&T, Verizon Communications and an expanding global list of advertisers that includes Volkswagen, Audi, HSBC Holdings, the Royal Bank of Scotland and L’Oreal. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” AT&T said in a statement. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” By extending its ban to everything beyond Google’s search results, AT&T is also effectively pulling its ads from more than two million other websites that depend on Google to deliver ads to their pages. In its statement, Verizon said it decided to pull ads from YouTube to protect its website while it investigates the “weak links” among its digital advertising partners. Both AT&T and Verizon may have an ulterior motive to make YouTube look like an untrustworthy spot for marketers because both companies are trying to sell more digital ads in their own networks. YouTube has become one of the fastest growing parts of Google’s ad system, which generated $79 billion in revenue last year. Google doesn’t disclose how much of that came from YouTube ads, but the research firm eMarketer estimated that the video site accounted for $5.6 billion that amount. EMarketer projected YouTube’s advertising will rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, but that prediction came before marketers began to suspend their spending. The YouTube boycott began late last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in videos delving into contentious themes.

For Google Photos, this means the introduction of a new feature that can backup low quality photos over poor cellular connections — even when a 2G connection is the only thing available. When user are able to connect to WiFi, Photos will replace these low quality uploads with high quality versions. There’s really no downside. The obvious question is the use case scenario that would make something like this convenient. Should something happen to your device on a trip where you had a poor connection, there’d be some peace of mind in knowing that your photos were backed up to the cloud. Even if it was just low quality versions, it’s certainly better than nothing. Google also notes that users will be able to immediately share low quality backups with friends and family on Google Photos and that they still look great on smaller smartphone screens. Again, these low quality photos will be replaced by high quality versions once a high-speed connection is established, so there’s no extra effort required from the user. It just works. The update should be rolling out soon on Google Photos and it wasn’t clear if this was an option that will need to be enabled in the app’s settings, or if it will just work this way by default. In either case, you can download Google Photos free right now on Google Play with unlimited high quality backups.

Home Industry Technology Google adds audio-only calls to Duo, file sharing to Allo Google adds audio-only calls to Duo, file sharing to Allo Google said on Wednesday it would offer an audio-only option on its Duo video calls service to help users communicate using poor-quality connections, and was adding a feature to permit file sharing in group chats on its Allo messaging App. By: Reuters | Sao Paulo | Published: March 23, 2017 4:46 AM Google said on Wednesday it would offer an audio-only option on its Duo video calls service to help users communicate using poor-quality connections, and was adding a feature to permit file sharing in group chats on its Allo messaging App. (Reuters) Google said on Wednesday it would offer an audio-only option on its Duo video calls service to help users communicate using poor-quality connections, and was adding a feature to permit file sharing in group chats on its Allo messaging App. The company launched Google Duo in August, providing video calls for users on Android and iOS, pitting it against Apple Inc’s FaceTime, Microsoft Corp’s video-calling app Skype and Facebook Inc’s Messenger. Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, said audio-only calls on Duo would be available from Wednesday in Brazil, and would be rolled out to users around the world in the coming days. The audio-only calls would work well on all connection speeds and be data efficient, Google Vice President for Product Management Mario Queiroz said in a blog post after he announced the moves at a Google conference in Sao Paulo. With more than 139 million people online, Brazil ranks among the top five internet populations in the world. In response to requests from users in countries like Brazil, Google said that Android users everywhere would be able to share documents and other files (.pdf, .docs, .apk, .zip, and mp3) with friends on Allo in group chats. You May Also Like To Watch This: It also said it was rolling out two new features for Google Photos on Android and iOS to make backup and sharing easier on low connectivity.”Now your photos will back up automatically in a lightweight preview quality that’s fast on 2G connections and still looks great on a smartphone,” Queiroz said in the blog post announcing the new features. When a stronger Wi-Fi connection becomes available, backed up photos would be replaced with high-quality versions, he added. Google also said it was adding a new location sharing feature in Google Maps to allow users to let friends and family know where they were and when they would arrive at their destination.Users can stop sharing that information at any time, Queiroz said.

Photo Credit: AFP / Getty Images advertisement | advertise on newsday SAN FRANCISCO - AT&T, Verizon and several other major advertisers are suspending their marketing campaigns on Google's YouTube site after discovering their brands have been appearing alongside videos promoting terrorism and other unsavory subjects. The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars.

But that diverse selection periodically allows ads to appear next to videos that marketers find distasteful, despite Google's efforts to prevent it from happening. Google depends largely on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. Earlier this week, Google vowed to step up its efforts to block ads on "hateful, offensive and derogatory" videos. "We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us," Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, wrote in a Tuesday blog post. advertisement | advertise on newsday As part of Google's solution to the problem, Schindler promised to hire "significant numbers" of employees to review YouTube videos and flag them as inappropriate for ads.

Posted on March 22, 2017 by Daisy Luther The Organic Prepper Who’s really got the power in America? Most people are living in an alternate reality created by those with the biggest platforms. Individual “reality” is defined by what people believe to be true more than what actually exists. A firmly held opinion can create such a vast cognitive dissonance that many people can actually witness something that challenges their belief and still deny that they could be incorrect.   This sounds like the biggest conspiracy theory ever, but if you are here reading this, you probably at least suspect that there are manipulations at play in nearly everything we view or read. There are just a few hundred people who control the media, entertainment, and the internet, and unless we are completely unplugged, we are lambasted with their versions of reality relentlessly every day. Let’s talk about how opinions are really formed and who has the influence to sway the people of America. No matter how well-informed a person tries to be, the truth can be hard to come by when bias is presented from so many primary sources. The Places People Get Their News and Information According to the Pew Research Group, people get their information from the following sources: Photo Credit Journalism.org This means that those with the power to influence are the people who pull the strings of network news, those in entertainment, those who make the rules of major social media platforms, and those with the biggest websites. Radio and print newspapers have little influence these days, and for that reason, most major print newspapers also have online outlets. Notice also how people of varying age groups rely more strongly on different sources for their information. Network News Who remembers sitting at the table or just after dinner, being bored to tears as a little kid while your parents were glued to the evening news?  I remember my dad wanted to watch the news from three sources because he wanted more than one opinion. I get it now, but at the time, it felt like “the news” would never be over. I usually ended up playing with my Barbies or reading a book. It seems that times haven’t changed much, if the Pew survey cited above is to be believed, and it appears that the older people are, the more likely they are to watch the news on TV. But here’s the catch. Although there are thousands of news stations across the country, nearly all of them are owned by six corporations. In the 80s, the stations were dispersed through about 50 different companies – not a lot but a far more diverse sampling than you have now that your news is filtered through the lenses of billionaire corporations. So, basically, everything we hear on the news is controlled by these six companies: Time Warner Walt Disney News Corp. Viacom CBS Corporation NBC Universal Whatever their opinions are, those are the biases from which your news will be presented. But it goes even deeper than just news because these corporations also control the entertainment industry. And what better way to control the masses than through propagandized drama in which the abnormal is normalized, and agendas are insidiously promoted without the knowledge of an unaware watcher? Here is a glimpse at the networks owned by these corporations. Photo Credit The Global Movement As you can see, nearly anything you watch on any channel is influenced by a handful of people – those who run these major corporations. If they want to push an agenda, you can rest assured that agenda will be present on each of their outlets in some form. The Rulers of the Internet People under 50 get more of their news and information from the web than any other source these days. One hundred websites get the majority of the traffic on the internet, and that traffic is massive. The people behind these websites are major influences in the reality perceived by Americans. Think about this: Google gets 28 billion visits per month. That means when you look something up on Google, you are provided with the answer Google wants you to have, which may or may not be the actual answer. YouTube follows quickly behind with 20.5 billion visits. (source) I’m sure by now you have heard that YouTube has taken advertising privileges away from a lot of videographers whose points of view are contrary to the agenda they wish to promote. They’re saying that the content is not “advertiser friendly” – and obviously, this discourages people who dedicate their days to advancing the truth from doing so. They too must make a living, and video editing is a time-consuming process. One well-done 10-minute video can take 8 hours to produce. These are the 100 websites that provide the “reality” for the majority of the people who rely on the internet for their news, as per Alexa.com’s traffic reporting system. Photo Credit Visual Capitalist Social Media You may have noticed in the infographic above that a massive amount of traffic goes to social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter. Both of those networks are notorious for censoring points of view that are not part of a liberal outlook. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you probably heard about Twitter permanently banning a bunch of popular Alt-Right people, most infamously, Milo Yiannopolis for his perspective. Now, personally, I’m not a fan of the Alt-Right viewpoint. It seems like they’re presenting meanness as “truth” when they could just as easily state true things without being jerks about it. But that is beside the point. If these people are going to be banned for their unsavory ways of communicating, why does Twitter allow things like #RapeMelania to trend? Why does Twitter allow actual threats against the President? If you’re going to start banning offensiveness, shouldn’t it be across the board? Then there’s Facebook, who has actually been busted running social experiments on its users by attempting to alter people’s moods with what they show in their timelines. But it doesn’t stop there. Nearly every blogger I know who works in the alternative news genre has been in Facebook jail at least once for presenting an unpopular opinion. I personally got warnings when I posted this article on my page – the article was taken down dozens of times and reported as “hate speech” when the “hate” it reported on was certainly not MY hatred. Of course, when you sign up to use any of these social media networks, you agree to their terms and conditions. They’re businesses and are under no obligation to be truthful or have integrity. Go ahead and use them – I do because they are helpful to my business – but do so fully aware that what you see presented there reflects the opinions of the management and not actual reality. So how do we get the truth? There really aren’t any unbiased sources out there. Having worked as an alternative journalist, I can tell you honestly that no matter how hard you try to be unbiased, your personal feelings sneak in, at least a little bit. Maybe it’s with the background information you provide to support your story because you can see the direction what you are reporting on is going. Maybe it is with a little bit of snarky commentary or a pithy headline. Because of this, many people pick the reality in which they want to live. Maybe they select ultra-conservative websites that reflect their religious beliefs. Perhaps they opt for anti-establishment outlets that gleefully point out in a non-partisan fashion that all of the politicians are sell-outs. For others, they want “news” that supports their warm, fuzzy liberal view of the world. It’s pretty easy to get manipulated through the subliminal messages and the predictive programming, but some folks seem to be immune. You really want to be one of those people, and if you aren’t, you can get there. I wrote about this previously: What if some people are genetically more susceptible than others? What if some of us are immune to this constant bombardment of images, words, and ideas that most people seem to buy into without question? Could this be the difference between the vast majority of the people and those of us are that are awake and aware? Are we just mutants? Is this why I can explain this stuff until I lose my voice and just get a blank stare from people who think I am the crazy one? The vast majority of people in the United States are completely accepting of the official message: They believe that the government will be there to save them in all circumstances. They don’t question or inquire. They simply accept what they are told. They don’t share our fears that something big is on the horizon. They exist in a bubble and don’t look at the bigger picture. They refuse to prepare for bad things because they honestly don’t believe it’s possible that those things will happen. Most people like us (those who are aware, the self-sufficient minority) watch less TV than the masses. Some of us watch no TV at all. I watch a few shows on Netflix or Amazon Prime, but we don’t have cable TV with its commercials and *cough* news. We have other things to do, things that will help us when there are soldiers on the streets “for our own protection.” Things that will help our kids survive when the store shelves are empty and the majority relies on government rations to live (if they behave well enough to get one that is, and behave they will because hunger is a massive motivator to do as you’re told.) Even if you have a tendency to be mind-controlled, it’s possible to snap out of it. I wasn’t always the tinfoil-clad blogger you see before you today. When I was in my early 20s, I truly did believe that the government agencies like the EPA and the FDA were looking out for our best interests, that food or medicine wouldn’t be sold if it was harmful, and that schools truly were in the business of educating children.  Most of us have to shake off our early training at the hands of the education system and the television. And sort of like in the movie, The Matrix, if you can get someone to swallow the red pill, they become a lot less willing to believe whatever they’re fed. Subliminal messaging can change people’s views, can change the way they think, can change what they want to eat, what car they want to buy, maybe even how they vote. All you need is the cash to get your message out there and buy a few split seconds of screen time. It can sow the seeds that make acceptance of abnormal and dangerous situations easier. It can teach people not to question and to be good little sheep. Sitting for hours in front of the television mindlessly watching the drivel produced by companies who call it “entertainment” is brainwashing people and turning them into idiots, making the best current day example of predictive programming the movie Idiocracy. All you have to do is look around and you’ll see that it’s here. What if you don’t want to live in an alternate reality created by the media? First of all, this doesn’t even touch on other influences like the ridiculous fear culture perpetuated in our schools or the Marxist indoctrination in our colleges and universities, where they teach you that gender isn’t a real thing and you get to pick whenever you want. There are many more players in the alternate reality game than just the media, but you have to start somewhere. My advice for those who don’t want to live in an alternate reality: Turn off the TV. Vet your sources. Try to get several points of view – even the ones you don’t like. The truth lies somewhere in between. Look out for talking points that are used ad infinitum like “deep state” or “with an abundance of caution”  or “the Russians.” The things you hear repeated over and over are repeated for a reason – to brainwash you. In the famous words of Fox Mulder, “The truth is out there.” You just have to seek it diligently.

Viacom CBS Corporation NBC Universal The best brainwashing corporations available. I’ve always said it… t.v. ‘programming’ has been THE # 1 downfall of this country. Reply DL. says: March 22, 2017 at 2:26 pm Like I said in a comment regarding Katy Perry yesterday, that many if not most entertainers of the various genres do what they are told (though someone clearly thinks I just make that stuff up by a comment below it—kiddo I wish that was true, and that Katy and others do what they do because they choose to do it, and it has nothing to do with the CIA or control by oligarchs and Satanists)—not that they would behave much differently if they had a choice. But there is a reason Perry, who was a Christian who “wanted to be like Amy Grant” (as she explained in a video of an interview), is not like Amy Grant. In fact, Amy Grant, having made it big in Christian pop, no longer does Christian pop, but regular pop–because she does what she is told. Here are my ideas for “turning off matrix ‘reality'” 1. write a book or novel or biography–use the language you learned to work your brain even if it means fiction (I write lots of fiction, self-published) based on your personal reality 2. do artwork, even if no one buys it–use it to decorate your home 3. do housecleaning and organize stuff 4. garden 5. hike-walk-bike ride, even if it’s in a suburb 6. play music, learn an instrument 7. read real books 8. learn a foreign language 9. learn “old school” skills, such as sewing (yes even men can sew!) or carpentry or gunsmithing or auto mechanics… 10. use your imagination (before ‘imagination’ goes by the wayside!), because no one apparently in Hollywood of the music industry knows much about ‘imagination’ these days! Which is why most movies are remakes and most songs are also just remakes (gee you’d think Linkin Park was someone’s cover band!) Reply tc says: March 22, 2017 at 4:24 pm Once again, I must respectfully disagree. I never claimed you were making things up. I just think you may be misinformed. Katy Perry is NOT under mind control. Katy Perry IS the mind control. And so were some of the rockers from the sixties you mentioned. The only hand that holds the gun to Katy Perry’s head, in order to make her sign any music contract, is the hand of Katy Perry. If Amy Grant and Katy Perry need to sing Christian music in order to feel more fulfilled they could easily be doing that in their local churches. Why aren’t they singing in a local church?

Google is one of the biggest companies on earth and the tech giant almost has a monopoly of the search engine market, such is their domination in the tech scene. A few months ago, we heard that Google would be using data obtained from users to let you know if a restaurant or public place you wish to visit is busy, which we found slightly invasive. Now Google are updating their Maps app with new features to let friends view each other's location in real-time. This means that if you're lying to your friends telling them you're on your way to their plans, while in reality you're sitting on the couch chowing down on pizza, your friends could now know you're telling fibs. Which could be a little bit awkward we think... The good thing is, you will be able to limit who can see your location and the length of time they're able to see your location. You will be able to share your location with anyone on your Google contacts list, regardless of what kind of device they're using. Advertisement There's no date yet on when the new feature will be coming into effect with Google stating that it will be "soon", without giving a concrete date. What do you think of the new feature? Video via Google Maps Episode 4 of our brand new podcast The Capital B is here! This week's pod includes: Tom Keogh of Keogh's crisps on why floury Irish potatoes make the world's most delicious crisps but the French couldn't care less; Biscuit mogul and former Fig Roll queen Alison Cowzer talks the billion euro industry of digestives and getting buttery Irish biscuits into the world's mouths; The real King of Connemara, Richard King on how to charm a foreign fish market with visions of the wild Atlantic ocean and Aran sweaters.

With more than 139 million people online, Brazil ranks among the top five internet populations in the world. In response to requests from users in countries like Brazil, Google said that Android users everywhere would be able to share documents and other files (.pdf, .docs, .apk, .zip, and mp3) with friends on Allo in group chats. It also said it was rolling out two new features for Google Photos on Android and iOS to make backup and sharing easier on low connectivity. "Now your photos will back up automatically in a lightweight preview quality that's fast on 2G connections and still looks great on a smartphone," Queiroz said in the blog post announcing the new features. When a stronger Wi-Fi connection becomes available, backed up photos would be replaced with high-quality versions, he added. Google also said it was adding a new location sharing feature in Google Maps to allow users to let friends and family know where they were and when they would arrive at their destination. Users can stop sharing that information at any time, Queiroz said.

The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars. YouTube’s popularity stems from its massive and eclectic library of video, spanning everything from polished TV clips to raw diatribes posted by people bashing homosexuals.

But that diverse selection periodically allows ads to appear next to videos that marketers find distasteful, despite Google’s efforts to prevent it from happening. Advertisement Google depends largely on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. Earlier this week, Google vowed to step up its efforts to block ads on “hateful, offensive and derogatory” videos. “We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a Tuesday blog post. As part of Google’s solution to the problem, Schindler promised to hire “significant numbers” of employees to review YouTube videos and flag them as inappropriate for ads. He also predicted YouTube would be able to address advertisers’ concerns through Google’s recent advancements in artificial intelligence — technology parlance for computers that learn to think like humans. But that promise so far hasn’t appeased AT&T, Verizon Communications and an expanding global list of advertisers that includes Volkswagen, Audi, HSBC Holdings, the Royal Bank of Scotland and L’Oreal. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” AT&T said in a statement. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” By extending its ban to everything beyond Google’s search results, AT&T is also effectively pulling its ads from more than two million other websites that depend on Google to deliver ads to their pages. In its statement, Verizon said it decided to pull ads from YouTube to protect its website while it investigates the “weak links” among its digital advertising partners. Both AT&T and Verizon may have an ulterior motive to make YouTube look like an untrustworthy spot for marketers because both companies are trying to sell more digital ads in their own networks. YouTube has become one of the fastest growing parts of Google’s ad system, which generated $79 billion in revenue last year. Google doesn’t disclose how much of that came from YouTube ads, but the research firm eMarketer estimated that the video site accounted for $5.6 billion that amount. EMarketer projected YouTube’s advertising will rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, but that prediction came before marketers began to suspend their spending. The YouTube boycott began late last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in videos delving into contentious themes.

Google today gave its Android Security 2016 Year in Review, saying that more than 735 million devices from over 200 manufacturers received a security update in 2016. “There’s still a lot of room for improvement however,” Google said, going on to say that it’s working to increase security updates by streamlining its security update program. This streamlining process will make it even easier for device makers to deploy security patches. Google will also make it easier for companies to release A/B updates so that it’s easier for users to apply security patches. Having a secure smartphone is important. Many folks store their whole lives on their smartphone, including photos, contact info, messages, and personal info, so it’s important that your smartphone is protected against malicious attacks. While Google is good about keeping its Nexus and Pixel phones up-to-date on security patches, not all other device makers are, so hopefully Google’s streamlining of the security update process will help other manufacturers increase their security update releases. Other tidbits from Google’s security report include drops in the number of Potentially Harmful Application (PHA) installs and the fact that carrier and hardware partners released security updates for more than half of the top 50 devices worldwide in the last quarter of 2016. When was the last time that your smartphone got a security update?

Harish V Nair  | Posted by Ashna Kumar  harish.nair@mailtoday.in New Delhi, March 23, 2017 | UPDATED 08:56 IST A +A - Highlights 1 SC asked Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Yahoo officials to hold a meet in India with information and technology ministry. 2 This will be regarding the circulation of sexual assault clips and child pornography on social media. 3 The report is to be submitted to the bench of justice Madan B Lokur and justice Uday U Lalit by April 21. In its biggest order against online sleaze, the Supreme Court on Wednesday directed top officials of Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Yahoo- most of them foreign-based- to come to India and hold a detailed 15-day meeting with the information and technology ministry. The mandate is clear: Indians will not get to see videos of sexual assault and child pornography. This is by far the biggest victory for the petitioner, 44-year-old Sunitha Krishnan, a gang-rape survivor who has turned saviour for thousands of victims across the country. The top court in 2015 ordered a CBI probe based on a letter written by her to former Chief Justice HL Dattu, complaining of rape videos being circulated on social media. Krishnan had also given a pen drive and sought action against the culprits. The apex court ordered that the meeting among members of technology firms and the government take place between April 5 and 20. The report is to be submitted to the bench of justice Madan B Lokur and justice Uday U Lalit by April 21. This is by far the biggest victory for the petitioner, 44-year-old Sunitha Krishnan.  KRISHNAN'S STORY "Please do not ask us to extend the deadline as they might (the foreigners who are coming in) find the summer severe," said justice Lalit. Having herself fallen prey to sexual assault when she was 15, Sunitha refused to go into a shell and instead gave birth to Prajwala, an institution that has rescued and assisted more than 10,000 girls trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation and found them shelter. The achievement got her recognition in the form of Padma Shri in 2016. Sunitha began the #ShameTheRapistCampaign when she uploaded an edited version of a gang-rape video on YouTube in February. It was one of nine such videos that were being circulated as MMS clips. She asked viewers to help identify the rapists. Observers say more and more perpetrators are recording their crimes on mobile phones to use as a blackmailing tool and to dissuade victims from going to the cops. Sunitha was forced to move the apex court with the help of her friend and activist Supreme Court lawyer Aparna Bhat as police did not make any arrests, though the men in the videos were clearly visible. RAPE VIDEOS CAN'T BE IN PUBLIC DOMAIN: SC BENCH The CBI made the first breakthrough on March 24, 2015, by arresting Bhubaneswar-based builder Subrat Sahu on charges of raping a woman and filming the act. As per the top court's order on Wednesday, Ajay Kumar, the additional secretary in the I-T ministry has been made the chairman of the crucial committee and he will coordinate with all the social media and internet giants. "The committee will assist and advise the court on the feasibility of ensuring that videos of rapes, gangrapes and child pornography are not available to the general public. They just cannot be in public domain, it is very clear," the bench said in the order.

Home Industry Verizon, AT&T suspend ads from Google, Youtube over offensive videos Verizon, AT&T suspend ads from Google, Youtube over offensive videos U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc said on Wednesday they have suspended some digital advertising from Google and YouTube because of concerns that their ads may have run next to offensive content. By: Reuters | Updated: March 23, 2017 5:05 AM U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc said on Wednesday they have suspended some digital advertising from Google and YouTube because of concerns that their ads may have run next to offensive content. (Reuters) U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc said on Wednesday they have suspended some digital advertising from Google and YouTube because of concerns that their ads may have run next to offensive content. AT&T said it was removing ads from Google’s non-search platforms specifically over concerns that its ads were running next to extremist videos.”We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” the company said in a statement. In a more sweeping move, Verizon said it has suspended all digital advertising outside of spots that show up in searches after it was notified that ads were appearing on “non-sanctioned websites.””We are casting a wide net,” a company spokeswoman wrote in an email. “We are working with all of our digital advertising partners to understand the weak links so we can prevent this from happening in the future.” You May Also Like To Watch This: Google declined to comment on individual customers but said it has begun a review of its advertising policies. “We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands,” the company said. U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc said on Wednesday they have suspended digital advertising on Google’s YouTube and other advertising platforms not related to search over concerns that their ads may have run next to extremist videos.Verizon and AT&T joined a list of well-known British brands such as retailer Marks and Spencer Group Plc deserting Alphabet Inc’s Google. Google is under fire in Europe from politicians and brands angered by ads appearing alongside videos on its YouTube platform carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages. Google on Tuesday vowed an overhaul of its practices. AT&T is removing ads from the non-search inventory on Google because its “ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” the company wrote in an e-mail. Verizon said it had suspended all digital advertising not related to search after saying earlier on Wednesday that it had only suspended advertising on Google’s non-search platforms. It took the action after its ads were appearing on “non-sanctioned websites,” a spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail. “We are working with all of our digital advertising partners to understand the weak links so we can prevent this from happening in the future,” the spokeswoman said. Google declined to comment on individual customers but said it has begun a review of its advertising policies. The news that AT&T and Verizon were suspending Google ads was first reported by Britain’s Times newspaper. Other big brands, such as Mondelez International, were keeping an eye on the situation. While Mondelez has not seen evidence that its ads have appeared alongside inappropriate content, it is in “constant discussion with both Google and YouTube and will be monitoring the issue closely,” a spokeswoman said. Google’s net ad revenue worldwide from YouTube was $5.58 billion last year, according to New York-based research firm eMarketer. It is expected to hit $7 billion in 2017, according to a forecast by eMarketer made before the recent controversy. One question many people are asking is whether advertisers will reallocate the marketing dollars they have devoted to YouTube to other platforms, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. Wieser, however, thinks that if the boycott is widespread enough, no one else will benefit. “If you know all of your competitors are reducing their spending too, then you don’t need to spend more,” he said.

The company has been selling assets like its Craftsman tool brand to offset a lack of customers. But it says its pension agreements may prevent the spin-off of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. ___ Trump's SEC pick, a lawyer for Goldman, to face skepticism WASHINGTON (AP) — Goldman Sachs may be about to get another friend in Washington. Jay Clayton, a well-connected Wall Street lawyer who is President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, is sure to face sharp questions from Democrats in his Senate confirmation Thursday over his years of work for Goldman and other financial giants. ___ Labour nominee says he won't let politics influence hiring WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Labor Department says he won't allow potential political pressure from the administration to influence his hiring decisions.

The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars. ___ Indexes inch back upward as tech stocks rise; Nike plunges NEW YORK (AP) — US stock indexes shook off a shaky start and finished mostly higher. Technology and industrial companies climbed but banks edged lower as bond yields slipped again. A day after a sharp loss, the market didn't make much headway. Nike plunged after issuing results and an outlook that disappointed investors, and Sears dropped after it said it may not be able to stay in business. ___ For some airline passengers, new warnings bring new hurdles NEW YORK (AP) — As far as the indignities of modern air travel go, the latest ban on laptops and tablets on some international flights falls somewhere between taking off shoes at the security checkpoint and testing baby food and milk for bomb residue. It's yet another impediment in the name of security for already weary travellers, especially those from or passing through the 10 mostly Middle Eastern and North African countries covered by new U.S. and British policies. While not quite as disruptive as an outright ban on smartphones — much less a travel ban based on nationality — the restrictions loom large for some. ___ AP Interview: Emirates defends security as laptop ban looms DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The president of Emirates, the Middle East's biggest airline, defended security measures at the carrier's Dubai hub on Wednesday and said the ban on personal electronics onboard U.S.-bound flights came without warning. Tim Clark told The Associated Press that he only learned of the new U.S. regulations the previous day, saying the carrier "had no prior knowledge whatsoever." ___ Retirement dreams fizzle for some with 'Obamacare' repeal CHICAGO (AP) — Workers dreaming of early retirement are getting the jitters as Washington debates replacing the Obama-era health care law with a system that could be a lot more expensive for many older Americans.

The Federal Communications Commission approved Richard and Sharon Burns' request through their company Frontier Media to increase their interest in 29 radio stations in Alaska, Texas and Arkansas to 100 per cent. The Burnses are citizens of Australia but have lived in the U.S. on special visas since 2006. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 6.71 points to 20,661.30.

Name: Subject: Message: Everything new in Android O: features and changes Features Newsby Kris Carlon14 hours ago 6 724 8 Like last year, Google dropped the first preview build for the upcoming Android version a couple of months ahead of Google I/O. This year, the first Android O developer preview arrived on March 21 (12 days later than last year) for the Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X and Nexus Player. We got busy and have brought together all the changes, features and things you should know about Android O. Check out every article in our “Diving Into Android O” series Download the official Android O wallpaper Android O release schedule The Android O release will ultimately become Android 8.0 <insert O dessert name here>. Google has already shared a timeline for the rollout of each preview build with the second developer preview due out in mid-May, likely during Google I/O, the third in mid-June and the fourth in mid-July. The public version of Android 8.0 will be out for supported Pixel, Nexus and Android One devices sometime in Q3, most likely in late August or early September. TL;DR Most of the major visual changes in Android O are relegated to the redesigned settings menu, but there are a few minor tweaks elsewhere in the UI like in the notification shade. Material Design is still the order of the day because Android O focuses on important background changes like notification channels to providing even greater control over the Android system. Some long-awaited features like picture-in-picture mode and unread notification app badges have finally landed while some entirely new features like better Bluetooth audio support and adaptive icons are a welcome addition. It’s early days yet, but Android O is looking feature-packed already. Notifications shade When you swipe down the notifications shade you’ll see the first visual changes in Android O. The strip of six toggles at the top of the notifications shade now takes up a little more space on-screen and there’s a little re-ordering of the toggles in Android O since Nougat. A new condensed font for the date and time means that information takes up less space, which is fortunate because there are now more status bar icons visible. A new condensed font for the date and time means that information takes up less space, which is fortunate because there are now more status bar icons visible. Besides the shortcut to the settings menu and the Quick Settings carat (downward-facing arrow), you’ve now also got Wi-Fi and cellular connection icons as well as the battery icon and remaining percentage (which is shown next to the battery icon). As for the notifications themselves, they look just the same as in Nougat, complete with bundled notifications and quick reply. If you have multiple notifications, you’ll notice that as you drag the notifications shade down, a tiny icon for each notification appears in a horizontal line at the bottom of the shade. As you drag the shade down, each icon pops up and expands into a full notification as more screen space becomes available. Notification handling As for notification handling, there’s some familiar stuff going on as well as some new options. If you long press on a notification you’ll see a toggle for Notifications, allowing you to disable all future notifications from that app (when notification channels are fully introduced you’ll also have access to them here, but more on that below). However, if you swipe a notification to the side a little, you’ll get two icons: one for accessing the Notifications toggle and a clock icon for snoozing the notification. If you tap the clock you’ll automatically snooze for 15 minutes but you can open the drop-down menu to snooze for 30 or 60 minutes instead or to disable snooze. Read more about notification handling in Android O Quick Settings When you open up the Quick Settings screen, you’ll see we still have different color schemes for the Pixels compared to Nexus devices. Nexuses get that same dark blue-gray background with aqua accents while the Pixels maintain the near-black and bright blue accent scheme. Looking at the Quick Settings themselves, Google has changed things up yet again. In Android O, the Quick Settings with a line underneath (Wi-Fi, cellular, Bluetooth, Do Not Disturb) have a double function. You can tap the icon to toggle the setting on and off, but if you tap the word underneath the toggle, you’ll open up the mini settings menu instead. The non-underlined toggles just enable a feature like the flashlight or cycle through modes like for data saver no matter where you tap them. Just like in Nougat, you can tap the pen icon to edit the order of the Quick Settings or add another page and you’ve got the same shortcut to add a guest or switch between user accounts. Android O finally adds native support for app badges. App badges Android O finally adds native support for app badges. They’re the little number bubble that shows up on an app icon to show you your unread notification count and are yet another custom launcher feature being absorbed into stock Android. Of course, you’ll have complete control over these at the flick of a toggle in the individual app notification settings. Read more about Android O app badges Settings menu The Settings menu is where most of the visual changes look to be taking place in the Android O release. The Settings menu is where most of the visual changes look to be taking place in the Android O release. For starters there’s a new color scheme: both the Pixels and Nexus devices get a black and white approach but you’ll still see their individual blue tones used for accents here and there. The Settings menu itself has received a bit of a reshuffle as well. I won’t bore with you with what section moved into which other section, so take a look at the screenshots below to see for yourself. The slide-out navigation drawer and hamburger menu icon have both been removed in this developer preview. The major change in Android O is that the Settings menu is much shorter than it was in Nougat, with no more umbrella categories like “wireless and networks,” “device,” “personal” and “system”. Instead, Android O has more descriptive sections that cover more ground, like “networks and internet,” “connected devices,” “apps and notifications” and “security and screen lock”. Read more on the new Android O settings menu Generally speaking, everything is in the same place, but a few changes are noticeable. For starters, in the Display settings, Pixel devices have an option for “device theme” with two choices: Inverted or Pixel. From what we can see right now all this does is change the Quick Settings area from light to dark but it may evolve into the long-awaited system-wide dark theme in later developer previews. Pixel devices have an option for “device theme” that may evolve into a system-wide dark theme in Android 8.0. The Pixels also show Night Light in the Display settings while the Nexus does not. As you may remember, night mode made a brief appearance on Nexus devices in the Android N preview builds, but was later removed for failing to meet Google’s performance standards. Dark mode, meanwhile, originally appeared in both the Android M and Android N previews, but has still not made it to prime time on any device. Most sub-sections in the Settings menu have also been overhauled visually. The battery and storage sections are all-new and the app info pages have a new look too. A whole bunch of stuff has now moved into the System sub-section, including languages and input, date and time, updates, about phone and backup and rest options. Everything you know from Nougat is here, but you'll have to go digging to find it. Pretty much everything you know from Nougat still exists in Android O, but you’ll have to go digging to find where it now lives. On the plus side, I have to congratulate Google for finally seeming to get things into places and groupings that make sense, without breaking everything down into an interminable list. System UI Tuner As with Nougat, you can enable the System UI Tuner to tweak certain things in Android O according to your personal preferences. To enable the UI Tuner, swipe down the notifications shade or Quick Settings and long-press the Settings gear icon. You’ll see it spin and feel a vibration when the option has been added to the Settings menu. Status bar In Android O, System UI Tuner now lives under Settings > System. It contains four areas (for now): status bar, do not disturb, navigation bar and lock screen. Status bar still provides a list of toggles for enabling or disabling which icons you see in the status bar, so you can remove persistent Bluetooth or hotspot icons if you so wish. The option to display the battery percentage inside the battery icon, which was a System UI Tuner option in Nougat, is no longer available though. Enabling “Always show percentage” in Android O will keep the battery percentage visible at all times in the status bar, but it’ll be placed next to the battery icon, just like in the Quick Settings view. Do not disturb Do not disturb simply shows two toggles: one for enabling a do not disturb mode toggle under the volume slider and another for adding a volume button shortcut so do not disturb turns on when you press the volume down button once more after vibration only. Navigation bar Next up is the navigation bar, which adds a bunch of cool options in Android O. There’s a layout option that lets you choose between normal, compact, left-leaning or right-leaning (which will come in handy on large-screened devices). Read more about customizing the nav bar in Android O You can also add additional buttons on the left and right of the traditional on-screen navigation buttons. You can choose from clipboard, keycode or keyboard switcher. Clipboard lets you save something to the clipboard and then simply drag it from the button in the nav bar anywhere you want to drop it: a very handy trick for emails, phone numbers and other frequently copy pasted items. Keycode lets you assign a numeric keycode and the keyboard switcher doesn’t appear to work yet. You can add additional buttons on the left and right of the traditional on-screen navigation buttons in Android O. Lock screen The lock screen in Android O looks the same as in Nougat but you have options buried in the System UI Tuner for mixing things up. Rather than the shortcuts in the bottom left and right corners for voice assist and the camera, you can change these to whatever you like. The list of options is absolutely huge, making us think it’s a definite Android 8.0 feature. While we’re talking about the lock screen, Ambient Display has also been revised. While this is more than likely just a developer preview issue, most of the time Ambient Display will only display the clock and some tiny app icons for any notifications awaiting you. With some app notifications, however, like Hangouts for example, you’ll see more information displayed, but only when the notification first comes in. Read more on custom lock shortcuts in Android O Random changes, additions and omissions: The Easter Egg is the same cat catching game from Android Nougat The Downloads app is gone, replaced by a new Files app The Memory section has now been relegated to Developer Options If you’re enrolled in the beta program you’ll constantly see an update notification to roll back to Nougat Like Android TV, Android O will deliver full support for picture-in-picture mode. Picture-in-picture support Like Android TV, Android O will deliver full support for picture-in-picture mode. You’ll already be familiar with this in the YouTube app, but when it is implemented across the board, app developers will be able to have their video apps continue playing in a small floating window while you navigate to other areas of the app or to completely different apps entirely. Android O will have support for custom controls like pause and play and developers will be able to set preferred aspect ratios. Read more about Android O app overlays, multi-display support and picture-in-picture Audio Sony donated their LDAC codec to Google for inclusion in Android O. That means if you have LDAC-equipped Bluetooth headphones you’ll get much better quality in Android 8.0. But the fun isn’t just restricted to LDAC, Android O also has support for aptX and aptX HD as well as SBC and AAC. There are also settings for audio sample rates and bits per sample too, plus Android O adds a native AAudio API for apps that require high fidelity, low latency audio. Read more about Android O Bluetooth audio support Notification channels These aren’t yet widespread in Android O, but notification channels are a way for apps to split their notifications into various themes that you can choose to let through or block individually. So instead of picking between receiving dozens of notifications from Twitter every day or none at all, notification channels will allow you to let through the direct reply channel, for example, but block likes and retweets. You’ll be able to manage these on the fly by long-pressing an app notification in the notifications shade or through the individual apps and notifications section in the settings menu. Read more about Android O notification channels Notification channels are a way for apps to split their notifications into various themes that you can choose to let through or block individually. Unknown sources Adding apps from anywhere outside Google Play typically just required you to hit your security settings and enable Unknown Sources. But in Android O things get taken up a notch. You’ll now also have to grant permission to the app you’re using to download the APK. For example, if you want to download an APK via Chrome, you’ll first be prompted to give Chrome permission to install other apps via the “trust apps from this source” toggle in the special access section of the apps and notifications setting. You only need to do this once per app however and you can always revoke permission at a later date. Background process limits Android O will severely limit background processes to intermittent windows of activity. Google has been optimizing Android more and more lately to limit the amount of battery drain and resource use that apps are allowed to do in the background. As we’ve seen a lot lately, advanced users will have control over exceptions to these rules, but by and large, Android O will severely limit background processes to intermittent windows of activity controlled by the job scheduler. Read more on background limits in Android O Adaptive icons Adaptive icons are a fancy way of saying that Google is making an attempt to tidy up the hot mess of inconsistent app icons in Android. They basically provide app developers with multiple shape templates for each icon that adapt to the device they appear on. So if the default app icon shape for your phone is a rounded square then that’s what you’ll see across the board. Rock a Pixel with circular icons and you’ll no longer see weird square icons mixed in with all the round ones. Read more on Android O adaptive icons Physical keyboard support Hardware keyboards are going to be becoming a bigger and bigger thing in Android as Chromebooks now have access to all Google Play apps and the mysterious Andromeda platform continues to lurk in the shadows. While we weren’t able to test out Android O’s hardware keyboard navigation support in any meaningful way, rest assured that Google is attempting to introduce more predictable standards for what the tab and arrow keys do when a physical keyboard is used to navigate Android. We need hardware keyboard support now that Chromebooks have access to Google Play apps. Autofill API The Autofill APIs introduced with Android O simply try to help apps manage passwords and form data better than in previous versions of Android. As Google notes in its blog post, “Users can select an autofill app, similar to the way they select a keyboard app. The autofill app stores and secures user data, such as addresses, user names, and even passwords”. We’ll have to wait a little while until app developers make full use of the Auofill APIs in Android O, but we should see much more capable password managers in future. Read more about the Autofill API in Android O Wider color gamut for apps Android developers can now take advantage of devices that have a wide-gamut color capable display. Android O adds support for “wide-gamut color for apps” which sounds a lot like native HDR support but which is actually just a larger palette of supported colors for app developers. As Google notes in the blog post, “Android developers of imaging apps can now take advantage of new devices that have a wide-gamut color capable display. To display wide gamut images, apps will need to enable a flag in their manifest (per activity) and load bitmaps with an embedded wide color profile (AdobeRGB, Pro Photo RGB, DCI-P3, etc.)”. Other stuff There’s plenty of other stuff worth noting too, but a lot of which we can’t see in effect yet. Android O adds font support so app developers can define font style and weight. This could either be a great development or a clusterfont if you’ll pardon my language. Wi-Fi Awareness allows your Android O device or app to communicate with other devices and apps in the vicinity over Wi-Fi without requiring an actual internet connection. There are also some major optimizations to the Android Run-Time (ART) responsible for handling your apps and WebView has also seen some enhancements you’re unlikely to ever even notice. Download Android O developer preview 1 How to install Android O on Pixel and Nexus phones Is it daily driver worthy? The first question on everyone’s lips is whether or not the first Android O developer preview is daily driver worthy. In my experience over the last day I haven’t experienced any problems, but I’ve been cloistered at home connected to Wi-Fi. I haven’t had cause to try out cellular data, call quality, audio quality, roaming, push notification reliability, battery usage or anything else yet. But I can say i haven’t seen any crashes, stutters, freezes or other concerning behavior. If you have a spare phone that has a factory image out for Android O, then absolutely, flash it and have a poke around for yourself. But I wouldn’t advise flashing this on your primary device for all the reasons just mentioned: this is a long, long way from a stable public release and so things will be broken. Just because I haven’t encountered them yet does not mean this is a good bet for the phone you keep by your side all day. Conclusion From what we can see so far Android O is shaping up to follow very much in Nougat’s footsteps, completing some of the work started in Nougat and further strengthening the granular nature of control in Android. User-facing notification and permission management are better than ever before and Android itself is taking an even more aggressive stance to apps that treat precious system resources with reckless abandon. Android O completes some of the work started in Nougat and further strengthens the granular nature of control in Android. Other than apparently having an entire team whose job it is to constantly come up with new ways to group things in the Settings menu, there are very little superficial changes here. Ushering in the next phase of Android peripherals is clearly a focus too, with better support for Bluetooth audio and hardware keyboards. But Android O is also catching up on a lot we’ve been waiting for, from adaptive icons, to the Autofill APIs, picture-in-picture mode, app badges and nav bar tweaks. The first developer preview is typically the one that is most feature-rich, with only a few notable additions in subsequent previews but a lot more subtractions as Google gets a grip on what’s possible in the time remaining and where to prioritize its efforts. I’m hoping the system-wide dark theme makes the cut this time around, but as you can probably see, the vast majority of the changes Android O has in store are of the background variety.

AT&T, Verizon, pharma giant GSK and the Enterprise car-rental company all said Wednesday they were pulling their ads from a variety of Google platforms including the YouTube video-sharing site until they are satisfied their brands aren’t popping up next to internet garbage. A Times of London report on Wednesday showed that Verizon ads were displayed next to a radical Egyptian cleric who is banned from the US. Google had disabled UK advertisers but US advertisers continued to show up there. AT&T’s ads, meanwhile, were found on a website featuring Al Qaeda operatives. This week, Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research was the first analyst to downgrade Google because of the dustup. It began last week when marketing giant Havas pulled all of its ads from Google’s YouTube UK site following a report from the Times of London that British government ads had been placed alongside videos from white supremacist David Duke and anti-Semite pastor Steve Anderson. Wieser told The Post Wednesday that the impact will be felt by Google, which instead of discussing how to take away TV ad dollars in upcoming ad negotiations will now be mired in “brand safety issues.” “The marginal increase [in ad dollars] is less likely to occur,” Wieser said. He said the impact on Google was likely to be around 1 percent of its revenue base, or $1 billion. SEE ALSO Google wakes up to its White Power problem 0:0 Google boss Larry Page is beginning to sweat. The search... “Google’s stated solution was late and woeful,” Wieser said. “Given numerous opportunities to nip it in the bud, they’ve seemingly made it worse.” The two telecom giants — which compete with Google for ad dollars — issued statements on Wednesday. AT&T said: “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate. Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” AT&T, which said it is pulling all of its ad spending from Google except for search ads, is the nation’s second-largest advertiser behind Procter & Gamble, spending some $3.3 billion on paid advertising, according to Advertising Age. Verizon ranked number five, spending $2.5 billion. “Once we were notified that our ads were appearing on non-sanctioned websites, we took immediate action to suspend this type of ad placement and launched an investigation,” Verizon said in a Wednesday statement. “We are working with all of our digital advertising partners to understand the weak links so we can prevent this from happening in the future.” A spokeswoman declined to say where Verizon’s ads were appearing. Verizon just acquired Yahoo and AOL in order to compete with Google for ad dollars. Google has apologized for the problem and has said it will revamp tools for advertisers to help correct the issues. “We’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear,” a Google spokesperson said Wednesday.

(Photo: JOSH EDELSON / AFP/Getty Images, file) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE San Francisco — AT&T, Verizon and several other major advertisers are suspending their marketing campaigns on Google’s YouTube site after discovering their brands have been appearing alongside videos promoting terrorism and other unsavory subjects. The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars. YouTube’s popularity stems from its massive and eclectic library of video, spanning everything from polished TV clips to raw diatribes posted by people bashing homosexuals. But that diverse selection periodically allows ads to appear next to videos that marketers find distasteful, despite Google’s efforts to prevent it from happening. Google depends largely on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. Earlier this week, Google vowed to step up its efforts to block ads on “hateful, offensive and derogatory” videos. “We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a Tuesday blog post. As part of Google’s solution to the problem, Schindler promised to hire “significant numbers” of employees to review YouTube videos and flag them as inappropriate for ads. He also predicted YouTube would be able to address advertisers’ concerns through Google’s recent advancements in artificial intelligence — technology parlance for computers that learn to think like humans. But that promise so far hasn’t appeased AT&T, Verizon Communications and an expanding global list of advertisers that includes Volkswagen, Audi, HSBC Holdings, the Royal Bank of Scotland and L’Oreal. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” AT&T said in a statement. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” By extending its ban to everything beyond Google’s search results, AT&T is also effectively pulling its ads from more than two million other websites that depend on Google to deliver ads to their pages. In its statement, Verizon said it decided to pull ads from YouTube to protect its website while it investigates the “weak links” among its digital advertising partners. Both AT&T and Verizon may have an ulterior motive to make YouTube look like an untrustworthy spot for marketers because both companies are trying to sell more digital ads in their own networks. YouTube has become one of the fastest growing parts of Google’s ad system, which generated $79 billion in revenue last year. Google doesn’t disclose how much of that came from YouTube ads, but the research firm eMarketer estimated that the video site accounted for $5.6 billion that amount. EMarketer projected YouTube’s advertising will rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, but that prediction came before marketers began to suspend their spending. The YouTube boycott began late last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in videos delving into contentious themes. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Phones by Dan Graziano March 20, 2017 5:00 AM PDT @DanGraziano Sarah Tew/CNET It's not me, Google. It's you. We had some great times together. Starting with the Galaxy Nexus all the way through the final Nexus phone, the 6P, I have owned three of Google's flagship phones. Unlike phones from nearly all other Android vendors, Google's Nexus phones came with an unskinned, crapware-free version of the operating system and they were the first Android devices to get software updates. Google followed the Nexus line with the Pixel phones last October. The new Pixel and Pixel XL come with an unskinned version of Android and continue the trend of timely software updates. They are also the first phones with the new Google Assistant, the company's answer to Siri and Alexa, aka the next-gen step-up "OK, Google." (That feature is now in the process of rolling out to all other Android models with the latest Nougat operating system.) I really wanted a Pixel, but I couldn't in good conscience justify it. My Nexus 6P was still a more than capable device. But when my 6P suddenly died, I began to question whether I should purchase a Google phone at all. Fool me once, shame on you Let's back up a bit to the Nexus 5. I purchased one a few months after its release in late 2013. Things were good, initially. The phone was fast and had great software, and I loved the feel of it. I ended up using it for a little over a year with no problems, but then one day it randomly rebooted and refused to fully power on. I was stuck in what is called a bootloop, when the phone will boot up to the company logo, restart and then repeat. Sarah Tew/CNET There were two likely causes for this: faulty software and faulty hardware. I was never given a straight answer as to why this had happened. I contacted Google customer service (as a customer, not a representative of CNET) and worked with them to try to fix the problem, to no avail. When I asked about a replacement I was told my warranty had expired a few days earlier. I didn't contact LG (the company that manufactured the phone) since I had purchased it via the Google Play Store. Feeling angry and helpless, I searched the Web hoping a fix would pop up somewhere. It turns out I wasn't alone. Users on multiple online forums had similar problems, many of which were caused by either a faulty power button or faulty software update. For me, I believe it was an update to Android 5.0.1 that caused the problem. The phone was still in near perfect condition and the power button worked fine and could still be used to shut the phone down. Google Pixel knocks it out of the park With a stellar camera, premium hardware and Google Assistant, the Google Pixel -- and the Pixel XL -- are excellent Android phones. by Lynn La 3:44 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF I called Google again and explained how I believed the software update the company had issued may have caused the problem. I was told the same thing as before -- my warranty was expired and there was nothing they could do. Fool me twice, shame on me I wasn't happy, but what could I do? I moved on with my life. I decided to skip Google's next phone, the Nexus 6, but that was due to the massive size of the device rather than my disappointing experience with the Nexus 5. When the more reasonably sized Nexus 6P was announced in late 2015, knew I had to have it. In hindsight, it's frightening how similar my 6P experience ended up being. The Nexus 6P was everything I could have wanted in a smartphone. It was fast, it had a great display and a good camera and it felt great in my hands. It will go down as one of my all-time favorites, even with the blemish I'm about to discuss. Josh Miller/CNET After a little more than a year, the Nexus 6P randomly rebooted and remained in a bootloop. As was the case with the Nexus 5, the phone was in great condition with no modifications. It was running pure Android straight from Google. This time I was certain it was the software. A few days earlier a notification on my phone had prompted me to update it to Android 7.1.1. I contacted Google customer service (once again, as a customer and not a representative for CNET) and was given the same spiel as last time: They weren't able to fix the problem. When reached for comment by CNET, a Google spokesperson said the company was "not aware of a bootloop issue for the Nexus 6P" and noted that "if the Nexus 6P was purchased from the Google Store, we will replace the device regardless of warranty status." I purchased mine from Best Buy, an authorized third-party retailer, and was told to contact Huawei, the phone's manufacturer. It took only a minute for the Huawei customer service representative to identify the problem. The man told me, "This is a known issue," adding that "the issue completely bricks the phone and it would need a completely new motherboard." I was shocked that a software update, one that was approved and sent directly from Google, could do this to my device. The rep informed me that "the Android update 7.1.1 caused a lot of issues on all devices." I was told that because the device was out of warranty (by only two weeks), Huawei wouldn't replace it. The customer service representative suggested I check out a local repair shop. I reached out to uBreakiFix, a repair shop recommended by Google, and was told the shop "doesn't perform motherboard replacements because it comes out to be too close to buying a used device of that same model." It seemed no one wanted to take responsibility for my broken phone. Unfortunately, I'm not the only person who experienced problems with the Nexus 6P. Despite Google's claims that it wasn't aware of any bootloop issue, users across multiple online forums complained of similar problems. Josh Miller/CNET I'm not ready to trust Google's customer service again Part of the reason those two customer service tales were so convoluted was because of the weird status of Google's Nexus hardware. Google essentially worked with manufacturers such as Samsung, LG and Huawei to make customized versions of their phones, which Google then sold as "hero" Android devices. But that left the product with two corporate parents -- Google and the manufacturer -- and a confusing customer service path. But with 2016's Pixel, Google took a different hardware approach. While the phone was still manufactured by a third party -- in this case, HTC -- it was designed by Google from the ground up. While the Nexus phones were essentially "Google Nexus 5 by LG," the Pixel phone is the "Google Pixel," full stop. The buck stops with them: Google controls things front to back, including all customer service obligations. That's all fine and good, but it ultimately feels like a distinction without a difference. From my vantage point, Google's software updates bricked two phones in a row -- models that the company effectively put forth as the best Android experience at the time. As mentioned above, a Google representative told CNET that the issues with a Nexus 6P with the bootloop issue would be replaced "regardless of warranty status" -- but only if it was purchased through the Google Store. That seems crazy to me. If Apple, Microsoft and Samsung products have different warranty terms when you purchase them through their respective stores, that's news to me. Does the same thing apply to Pixel phones? Who knows. And as Google offers more and more of its own branded hardware beyond the Pixel -- Google Home, Chromecast streamers, Wi-Fi routers and maybe even more Chromebooks -- the question becomes ever more pertinent. (Some glitches have already been reported on Pixel phones and Google Home speakers, but they're both well within their one-year warranty.) Ultimately, so long as you're purchasing a product through an authorized retailer -- new and sealed from, say, Best Buy -- Google should back the hardware with the same guarantees that it's offering to Google Store customers. Simply put, when a software update from Google breaks a device, Google should feel obligated to fix it, regardless of where it was purchased. Until then, I won't be buying a Pixel phone.

By Sara Ashley O'Brien NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- "Where are you?" "What's your ETA?" "When will you be here?" Google wants to help people answer those age-old (and tiresome) questions -- without using any words at all. On Wednesday, Google announced a Maps update that adds a new location-sharing feature. The update gives people the option to share their real-time whereabouts, and their travel routes, with select contacts for a chosen time period, according to a blog post from Google Maps engineering manager Daniel Resnick. To share your location information, Google Maps planted a "Share Location" button in the side tab on the Maps browser (just swipe from the left part of the screen). You can also just tap the blue dot on the map that indicates your location. Then, you can chose who to share your location with -- and for how long. Google also introduced a "share trip" feature which provides contacts with the trip route and ETA. Contacts can track a trip as it's occurring, ending with arrival at the destination. So if you're running late to dinner, you can share your location so that the rest of your party can see where you are on your route. Or if you're driving to your parents' house, you can share your location and ETA with your mom so she doesn't worry about you. Related: AT&T and Verizon halt Google ads over extremist videos Don't worry about sharing your location forever: You can stop broadcasting at any time. Google also introduced several other updates to other apps on Wednesday, including adding file sharing to its messaging app Allo, audio calls to its video chat service Duo, and improvements to Google Photos backup capabilities. The idea isn't novel. Apple's default Find My Friends app lets people locate your friends and family from your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch, or iCloud, and people can also share their whereabouts on iMessage, which pulls from Apple's Maps. But Google Maps is by far the most-used app for directions, and its ETA sharing is unique. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Sifting through the report, major highlights include improvements in dangerous app detection and increased collaboration with partners on monthly patches. Google also shared some of its security plans for the year ahead. One goal was to reduce the number of Potentially Harmful Apps through improved tracking. Google notes that its Verify Apps service conducted 750 million daily checks in 2016, up from 450 million in 2015. Inside the Play Store, there were across the board drops with only 0.05 percent of devices that downloaded apps from Google containing a PHA; down from 0.15 percent in 2015: Now 0.016 percent of installs, trojans dropped by 51.5 percent compared to 2015 Now 0.003 percent of installs, hostile downloaders dropped by 54.6 percent compared to 2015 Now 0.003 percent of installs, backdoors dropped by 30.5 percent compared to 2015 Now 0.0018 percent of installs, phishing apps dropped by 73.4 percent compared to 2015 Last year also saw an expansion of the monthly security updates program. While 735 million devices from over 200 manufacturers received a security update, half of all Android devices did not. Moving into 2017, Google is working on streamlining the security update program to make it easier for manufacturers to deploy security patches. Notably, Google wants to reduce the process from over one month to less than one week. Additionally, machine learning and automation will “significantly” reduce PHA rates from Google Play and external sources. While these security features are available through the independent Google Play Services, newer features like A/B updates can only be achieved through full Android version updates.

In recent tests, a new type of optical digital signal processing technology from Nokia Bell Labs achieved a capacity that’s roughly 2.5 times that of current systems. The technology, running along a subsea cable that stretches from New York to Ireland, could make for much more efficient data transmission as bandwidth-hungry online activities such as virtual reality continue to grow. Scroll down for video  The technology, running along a subsea cable that stretches from New York to Ireland, could make for much more efficient data transmission as bandwidth-hungry online activities such as virtual reality continue to grow THE NEW TECHNIQUE  Facebook and Nokia teamed up to test Nokia Bell Labs’ new technology, called ‘probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS).’ The researchers completed multiple submarine filed trials along a 5,500 kilometer (3,415 mile) subsea cable that stretches from New York to Ireland. PCS uses ‘shaped’ quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) formats to flexibly adjust transmission capacity, according to Nokia. This pushes a fiber-optic cable nearly to the physical limit. Tests revealed the technology achieved new record of spectral efficiency, at 7.46 b/s/Hz. And, it bumped the system up to nearly 2.5 times its stated capacity.  Nokia Bell Labs’ new technology, called ‘probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS),’ brings the system up to a transmission capacity that’s just shy of the physical limits of fiber-optic cables, according to the firms. Researchers tested it out across a 5,500 kilometer (3,415 mile) cable in the Atlantic, and found it hit a new record of spectral efficiency, at 7.46 b/s/Hz. And, it bumped the system up to nearly 2.5 times its stated capacity. In the future, they say it may even be possible to achieve 32 Tb/sec per fiber. ‘Facebook wants to increase the pace of innovation and adoption of next-generation optical technologies,’ said Dr Stephen Grubb, global optical network architect at Facebook. ‘This field trial with Nokia demonstrates that the scalable optical technology of PCS together with narrow linewidth laser sources can achieve capacities extremely close to the Shannon limit. ‘This ensures that we are both maximizing our investment in submarine cable systems, as well as continuing to drive the cost per bit of submarine transport lower.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Should ROBOTS be running the country?

Share this article Share 12 shares Last year, tech giants revealed a plan to build an 8,000 mile undersea internet cable across the Pacific Ocean to connect Los Angeles to Hong Kong. The effort, including Google, Facebook, Pacific Light Data Communication, and TE SubCom, would construct a system that’s twice as powerful as the record-holding Faster cable that went live last June, which was said to be 10 million times quicker than a modem. An 8,000 mile undersea internet cable connecting Los Angeles to Hong Kong is set to be built across the Pacific Ocean by 2018. It will be twice as powerful as the record-holding Faster cable that went live in June, which was said to be 10 million times quicker than a modem PLCN SUBSEA CABLE  The PLCN will stretch nearly 8,000 miles, from Los Angeles to Hong Kong. It is an ultra high-capacity system, capable of 120-terabits-per-second. This is twice the capabilities of the Faster cable, which connects the US to Japan. Researchers say the new would be able to support 80 million simultaneous HD video conference calls between Asia and North America. They plan to have it completed by 2018. According to the researchers, the new ultra high-capacity system would be able to support 80 million simultaneous HD video conference calls between Asia and North America, and will bring faster speeds and increased security.  Plans for the Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) were announced on the Google Cloud Platform Blog. The cable will be the highest capacity trans-Pacific system, with a capacity of 120 terabits-per-second, and is the sixth undersea cable the Google has taken part in.  ‘From the get-go, PLCN is designed to accommodate evolving infrastructure technology, allowing us to independently choose network equipment and refresh optical technology as it advances,’ the Google team wrote. Plans for the Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) were announced last year on the Google Cloud Platform Blog THE 5,600 MILE 'FASTER' CABLE  The Faster subsea cable system has 60TBps total capacity – 10 million times faster than a cable modem. It transmits multiple colours of light over various frequencies, using a repeater to reenergize the light roughly every 37 miles. It has landing points in Oregon, in the US, and Chiba and Mie, in Japan, but connectivity will extend along the West Coast of the US and to major cities in Japan and other Asian locations.  ‘Most importantly, PLCN will bring lower latency, more security, and greater bandwidth to Google users in the APAC region.’ Along with this, the firm says it will expand Google’s reach in Asia for Google Cloud and G Suite users. Just months before that, Google revealed the completion of its subsea cable system that stretches from the United States to Japan. The $300 million ‘Faster’ cable system is backed by six companies, including Google, and runs through the Pacific Ocean from Oregon to Chiba and Mie.  The system currently has a greater total capacity than any other undersea cable, Google SVP of Technical Infrastructure Urs Hölzle revealed in a blog post. It can deliver 60 terabits per second of bandwidth 5,600 miles across the ocean, bringing high speed connection to users in the US and Japan.  The subsea cable system can deliver 60 terabits per second of bandwidth 5,600 miles across the ocean, bringing high speed connection to users in the US and Japan. It has landing points in Oregon, and Chiba and Mie, in Japan, but the benefits won’t be limited only to these areas   Read more: Internet users and our customers in Japan today should notice things seem to be¿ Google Cloud Platform Blog: New undersea cable expands capacity for Google APAC customers and users Share or comment on this article e-mail 12 shares Most watched News videos Shocking moment terror attacker's car speeds across bridge Dramatic video shows horror of aftermath on Westminster Bridge Terrified public flee as three shots ring out in Parliament Square Commotion outside Parliament as police react after attack Injured people lay stricken on Westminster Bridge after attack Horrifying car crash scene shows victim at Parliament railings 'Go! go!'

The vulnerability was discovered by Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy and was reported to LastPass on Monday. It affected the browser extensions installed by the service's users for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge. According to a description in the Google Project Zero bug tracker, the vulnerability could have given attackers access to internal commands inside the LastPass extension. Those are the commands used by the extension to copy passwords or fill in web forms using information stored in the user's secure vault. If the extension's binary component is installed, the "openattach" command can be used to run arbitrary code on the computer, Ormandy said on the bug tracker. The LastPass developers deployed a workaround on their server to prevent exploitation and plan to include a full fix in new versions. On Tuesday Ormandy reported another vulnerability in the Firefox extension that, according to the LastPass developers, was related to the first one. That vulnerability was fixed in a new version of the Firefox extension, 4.1.36a, that was released Wednesday. "We have no indication that any of the reported vulnerabilities were exploited in the wild, but we’re doing a thorough review at this time to confirm," the LastPass developers said in a blog post. "No password changes are required of users at this time." To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Google is enabling users of its digital mapping service to allow their movements to be tracked by friends and family. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Michael Liedtke SAN FRANCISCO — Google Maps users will soon be able to broadcast their movements to friends and family — the latest test of how much privacy people are willing to sacrifice in an era of rampant sharing. The location-monitoring feature started rolling out Wednesday in an update to the Google Maps mobile app, which is already installed on most of the world's smartphones. It will also be available on personal computers. Google believes the new tool will be a more convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without having to text or call them. The Mountain View, Calif., company has set up the controls so individuals can decide with whom they want to share their whereabouts and for how long — anywhere from a few minutes to indefinitely. But location sharing in one of the world's most popular apps could cause friction in marriages and other relationships if one partner demands to know where the other is at all times. Similar tensions could arise if parents insist their teenagers turn on the location-sharing option before they go out. It could also be turned into a way to stalk someone entangled in an abusive relationship, warned Ruth Glenn, executive director for the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. "It has the potential to be another tool in an abuser's tool kit," she said. Similar tracking is already available on other apps; Glympse, founded by former Microsoft employees, has offered this function for years. Although it isn't as wide-ranging, Apple also offers a tracking option called "Find My Friends" on its iPhone, iPad and Watch. That's one of the reasons Google isn't expecting a lot of complaints about adding the option to Maps, especially since everyone can decide when to turn it on and who can monitor them. "We don't feel like we are changing the game," said Jen Fitzpatrick, Google's vice-president of Maps. Maps users will be able to activate the location-sharing feature by tapping a button near the search bar and then picking a person from their contact list to text with the information. If the recipient doesn't have the Google Maps app on their phone, it will text them a link to open the location on the map in a browser. The settings also allow users to determine how long their movements can be tracked each time a location is shared. If no time limit is selected, Google will periodically send people email reminders that they're still sharing their location, a step that Glenn said may help anyone who didn't know an abusive partner was still following them.

The company has been selling assets like its Craftsman tool brand to offset a lack of customers. But it says its pension agreements may prevent the spin-off of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. ___ Trump's SEC pick, a lawyer for Goldman, to face skepticism WASHINGTON (AP) — Goldman Sachs may be about to get another friend in Washington. Jay Clayton, a well-connected Wall Street lawyer who is President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, is sure to face sharp questions from Democrats in his Senate confirmation Thursday over his years of work for Goldman and other financial giants. ___ Labor nominee says he won't let politics influence hiring WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Labor Department says he won't allow potential political pressure from the administration to influence his hiring decisions. Alexander Acosta tells a Senate committee he regrets that political tests played a role in employment practices used by a subordinate when Acosta headed the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under President George W. Bush. ___ Google's YouTube losing major advertisers upset with videos SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — AT&T, Verizon and several other major advertisers are suspending their marketing campaigns on Google's YouTube site after discovering their brands have been appearing alongside videos promoting terrorism and other unsavory subjects. The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars. ___ Indexes inch back upward as tech stocks rise; Nike plunges NEW YORK (AP) — US stock indexes shook off a shaky start and finished mostly higher. Technology and industrial companies climbed but banks edged lower as bond yields slipped again. A day after a sharp loss, the market didn't make much headway. Nike plunged after issuing results and an outlook that disappointed investors, and Sears dropped after it said it may not be able to stay in business. ___ For some airline passengers, new warnings bring new hurdles NEW YORK (AP) — As far as the indignities of modern air travel go, the latest ban on laptops and tablets on some international flights falls somewhere between taking off shoes at the security checkpoint and testing baby food and milk for bomb residue. It's yet another impediment in the name of security for already weary travelers, especially those from or passing through the 10 mostly Middle Eastern and North African countries covered by new U.S. and British policies. While not quite as disruptive as an outright ban on smartphones — much less a travel ban based on nationality — the restrictions loom large for some. ___ AP Interview: Emirates defends security as laptop ban looms DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The president of Emirates, the Middle East's biggest airline, defended security measures at the carrier's Dubai hub on Wednesday and said the ban on personal electronics onboard U.S.-bound flights came without warning. Tim Clark told The Associated Press that he only learned of the new U.S. regulations the previous day, saying the carrier "had no prior knowledge whatsoever." ___ Retirement dreams fizzle for some with 'Obamacare' repeal CHICAGO (AP) — Workers dreaming of early retirement are getting the jitters as Washington debates replacing the Obama-era health care law with a system that could be a lot more expensive for many older Americans. The uncertainty over the cost of coverage in the individual market has caused some in their 50s and early 60s to put plans on hold. ___ Australia pair are first foreigners to own US radio stations JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — An Australian couple with roots in Alaska has bought radio stations in three states, marking the first time federal regulators have allowed full foreign ownership of U.S. radio stations. The Federal Communications Commission approved Richard and Sharon Burns' request through their company Frontier Media to increase their interest in 29 radio stations in Alaska, Texas and Arkansas to 100 percent. The Burnses are citizens of Australia but have lived in the U.S. on special visas since 2006. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 6.71 points to 20,661.30. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 4.43 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,348.45. The Nasdaq composite rose 27.82 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,821.64. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies sank 0.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,345.60. U.S. crude lost 20 cents to $48.04 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 32 cents to $50.64 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline remained at $1.60 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.50 a gallon. Natural gas sank 8 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $3.01 per 1,000 cubic feet. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

The location-monitoring feature will begin rolling out Wednesday in an update to the Google Maps mobile app, which is already installed on most of the world’s smartphones. It will also be available on personal computers. Google believes the new tool will be a more convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without having to text or call them. The Mountain View, California, company has set up the controls so individuals can decide with whom they want to share their whereabouts and for how long — anywhere from a few minutes to indefinitely. But location sharing in one of the world’s most popular apps could cause friction in marriages and other relationships if one partner demands to know where the other is at all times. Similar tensions could arise if parents insist their teenagers turn on the location-sharing option before they go out. It could also be turned into a way to stalk someone entangled in an abusive relationship, warned Ruth Glenn, executive director for the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. “It has the potential to be another tool in an abuser’s toolkit,” she said. Similar tracking is already available on other apps; Glympse, founded by former Microsoft employees, has offered this function for years. Although it isn’t as wide-ranging, Apple also offers a tracking option called “Find My Friends” on its iPhone, iPad and Watch. That’s one of the reasons Google isn’t expecting a lot of complaints about adding the option to Maps, especially since everyone can decide when to turn it on and who can monitor them. “We don’t feel like we are changing the game,” said Jen Fitzpatrick, Google’s vice president of maps. Maps users will be able to activate the location-sharing feature by tapping a button near the search bar and then picking a person from their contact list to text with the information. If the recipient doesn’t have the Google Maps app on their phone, it will text them a link to open the location on the map in a browser. The settings also allow users to determine how long their movements can be tracked each time a location is shared. If no time limit is selected, Google will periodically send people email reminders that they’re still sharing their location, a step that Glenn said may help anyone who didn’t know an abusive partner was still following them.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Business Advertisers reportedly dump Google and YouTube, worried about extremist videos WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22, 2017, 3:09 P.M. By David Pierson and Paresh Dave Los Angeles Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Major American brands, including AT&T and Verizon, are reportedly pulling advertising from Google and its YouTube division in response to a growing scandal over extremist videos hosted by the internet giant. More than 250 organizations, including the British government, have already pulled advertising in Britain after a leading newspaper there published an investigation last week detailing how ordinary ads appear alongside YouTube videos that promote hate and extremism. The report by Britain’s The Times showed how L’Oreal ads appeared next to videos by homophobic British preacher Steven Anderson and how government-funded ads for the Royal Navy and Scottish tourism appeared next to clips by white supremacist David Duke, an American who has been head of the Ku Klux Klan. Google apologized Monday after pledging to police ads next to the offending videos in Britain, the company’s second-largest market. The risk for Google – a subsidiary of Mountain View, Calif.-based Alphabet Inc. – is that the fallout could spread further, especially in the U.S., its largest market. In addition to AT&T and Verizon, Enterprise Rent-A-Car pulled advertising from Google, The Times reported Wednesday. The companies could not be immediately reached for comment. The Times reported that Verizon suspended its digital advertising after it learned its ads appeared alongside videos by two Muslim clerics: Wagdy Ghoneim, an Egyptian who the U.S. government said participated in fundraising activities that could have helped terrorist organizations, and Hanif Qureshi, a Pakistani whose preaching reportedly inspired the assassination of a politician in that country. “AT&T adverts were also placed on YouTube videos showcasing an Islamic State flag and another promoting the sermons of Anwar Al Awlaki, a senior Al Qaeda recruiter killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2011,” The Times reported. The advertisers’ moves come as Google’s dominance in digital advertising is being increasingly challenged by Facebook Inc. and, to a lesser extent, by Snap Inc.’s Snapchat and by Verizon Communications Inc. Google commands about 40 percent of U.S. online ad sales. Concerns over where ads appear online have persisted since the advent of digital advertising, but they now offer fresh leverage in pushing for greater concessions and increased options in deal talks with the search and video giant.

Twitter Facebook LastPass fixes serious password leak vulnerabilities One of the flaws could have also allowed for malicious code execution on users' computers under certain conditions Lucian Constantin (IDG News Service) 23 March, 2017 08:21 - - - - print email Comments Developers of the popular LastPass password manager rushed to push out a fix to solve a serious vulnerability that could have allowed attackers to steal users' passwords or execute malicious code on their computers. The vulnerability was discovered by Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy and was reported to LastPass on Monday. It affected the browser extensions installed by the service's users for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge. According to a description in the Google Project Zero bug tracker, the vulnerability could have given attackers access to internal commands inside the LastPass extension. Those are the commands used by the extension to copy passwords or fill in web forms using information stored in the user's secure vault. If the extension's binary component is installed, the "openattach" command can be used to run arbitrary code on the computer, Ormandy said on the bug tracker. The LastPass developers deployed a workaround on their server to prevent exploitation and plan to include a full fix in new versions. On Tuesday Ormandy reported another vulnerability in the Firefox extension that, according to the LastPass developers, was related to the first one. That vulnerability was fixed in a new version of the Firefox extension, 4.1.36a, that was released Wednesday. "We have no indication that any of the reported vulnerabilities were exploited in the wild, but weâre doing a thorough review at this time to confirm," the LastPass developers said in a blog post. "No password changes are required of users at this time." Join the Computerworld New Zealand newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

The rules passed by the FCC in October prevent broadband companies from selling "sensitive" consumer information like app usage data and web browsing history to third parties like advertisers. Sen.

Flake also argued that consumers are already protected by section 222 of the Communications Act, which provides some rules on what data telecommunications companies can collect from consumers.

"Passing [the CRA] will take consumers out of this driver's seat and place the collection and use of their information behind a veil of secrecy, despite rhetoric surrounding our debate today suggesting that eliminating these common-sense rules will better protect consumers' privacy online or will eliminate consumer confusion," Nelson contended. "It will create a "privacy free" zone for broadband companies – with no federal regulator having effective tools to set rules of the road for collection, use, and sale of uniquely personal information," Nelson continued. The Senate's vote tonight will be the first step in killing the rules. Flake's resolution will likely receive a vote on final passage tomorrow. The CRA will then need to be passed in the House next and subsequently signed by President Trump.

In his Capitol Hill meetings, Gates stressed the potential impact that budget cuts could have on programs backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, according to a Gates Foundation spokesperson. These programs include efforts to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, to contain malaria and to deliver vaccines. "Cuts to these high-value, high-impact programs could put millions of lives at risk," said a Gates Foundation spokesperson. Gates also "raised the importance of expanding access to economic opportunity and education here at home," the spokesperson said. Read more here.

AT&T, VERIZON PULL GOOGLE ADS: AT&T and Verizon are pulling out of certain Google advertising services over concerns that their ads would appear alongside content promoting hate speech and extremism. Google was forced to announce changes to its ad policies this week after a Financial Times report showed that major companies' ads were appearing alongside YouTube videos from hate groups, anti-Semites and other extremist sources. "We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate," an AT&T spokesman said in a statement Wednesday. "Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms." "Verizon is one of the largest advertisers in the world, and one of the most respected brands," added a Verizon spokesman. "We take careful measure to ensure our brand is not impacted negatively. Once we were notified that our ads were appearing on non-sanctioned websites, we took immediate action to suspend this type of ad placement and launched an investigation." Read more here. CYBERSECURITY Q&A: Caleb Barlow, Vice President of Threat Intelligence at IBM spoke at today's Senate Commerce Committee hearing on cybersecurity. We caught up with him for a quick Q&A on the topic after the hearing. Augmenting cybersecurity progress with AI: With a lot of these new technologies -- with any new technologies, there is the kind of spin on the positive and negative. We're talking about how do you find the needle in the stack of needles. You need to augment the people with tools who can dig through all these events and correlate them with the 60,000 security blogs that are coming out every month, the 10,000 security papers and actually read them all, because people can't read them all. We're finally at the point with Watson where we can augment with some of the best people we have, and Watson can find things they can't find just because how hard it is to sort through that much information. On stopping the biggest threats with data sharing: "It's really easy in the security industry to get enamored by threats, particularly when we get involved with nation-state actors that gets quickly sensationalized. The reality is what we're dealing with is highly organized and sophisticated cyber-criminal gangs. We're all getting robbed here, regardless of what country we come from. We can mitigate that by better threat sharing. If we all inform each other of what criminal gangs are doing at speed, then we change our economics. And if we change our economics they're not incentivized to hack us in the first place. If we can get that noise out of the system, we can solve 80 percent of the problem. What's required is continuing to step forward and sharing that intelligence data." On getting people to share data on cyberthreats: "The first thing is that we need to appeal to people's philanthropic nature. If you're not sharing, not only what happens to you, but how it happens to you, then you are absolutely apart of the problem. I think it on all of us to start to use terminology like that and appeal to the greater good. In addition to that, I think there are incentives that governments can create to get people to share data. Whether it's discounts on products that people care about or other governmental incentives to get people to share threat data. A lot of times it's just getting people over the hump of realizing how important this is." On mitigating the skills gap in cybersecurity: "I think one thing we have to rationalize is that there's 1.5 million cybersecurity jobs that will be unfilled by 2020. If you look at this industry, there's very few minorities. There's only 10 percent women. It's completely unacceptable. There's opportunities to fix it. Clearly, universities can do more in having degree programs and entire departments. We also have to go down to community colleges. Even deeper than that I think there's an opportunity here for new collar jobs, jobs where people don't have a traditional four year degree in computer science, but maybe they're coming in with a linguist background. We can work with them to adapt their capabilities and adapt it with cognitive computing to help us fight this battle."  ON TAP: The Open Technology Institute will hold an event on ranking digital rights at 9:30 a.m. The FCC will hold its monthly open meeting at 10 a.m. IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: House Oversight grills law enforcement on facial recognition tech Elon Musk isn't pleased with the new NASA funding bill Smaller firms wait for WikiLeaks to fulfill info-sharing promise Axios: Linkedin's new trending news section Facebook announces that users will be able to broadcast live from their computer Tags Charles Schumer Bill Nelson Eric Holder Jeff Flake   View the discussion thread.

Thursday, 23rd March 2017 Twitter Facebook RSS Home Top Stories Local Africa International Business Opinion & Analysis Crime & Courts Entertainment Sport Advertise Bosso target CAPS scalp China’s Sinopec in first oil deal in Africa Google.org announces $50m for education March 23, 2017 silence muchemwa Features, Opinion & Analysis Betsy Beaumon SAN FRANCISCO. — Google.org yesterday announced a $50 million commitment to education non-profits over the next two years. It marks the largest commitment to a single topic area ever made by the organisation — the philanthropic arm of Google — and reflects its focus on technology as part of the solution to poverty and inequality. “We’ve seen there’s a role for technology to play in creating a richer learning environment, but only if we can get all teachers and students really benefiting from it,” said Brigitte Hoyer-Gosselink, education lead at the “dot org” offices in San Francisco, ahead of the announcement. Nine organisations will receive funding at first, with another round of organisations to be added later in the year for a total of 20 by the end of 2017. The funding will be focused on three areas in which the organisation believes technology can improve education in developing countries: providing access to quality learning materials; training and engaging teachers; and helping students in crisis and conflict zones. However, Google.org says that the priority areas could evolve over the next two years. The grantees revealed today include Learning Equality, which is taking digital content offline; War Child Holland, which uses a game-based approach to education for children affected by conflict; Million Sparks Foundation, which is focused on teacher capacity building; and Pratham Education Foundation, which works to improve the quality of education in India and will scale to additional villages with support from Google.org. Support will also go to the Clooney Foundation for Justice — to which Google.org announced a $1 million grant in September — for the education of refugee children in Lebanon. Khan Academy, the massive online open course company that Google.org supported with $2 million in 2010, will receive an additional $5 million to expand its programming. StoryWeaver, an open source platform for stories from the Pratham Books non-profit, will have access to expertise from Google Translate team members and technologies, in addition to $3,6 million of financial support. And two more organisations will be revealed later this week, the Google.org team told Devex. Google.org president Jacquelline Fuller emphasised that organisation always aims to contribute more than just cash, also offering the expertise of Google employees, or “Googlers” as they are known. As part of its contributions to the refugee crisis, for example, employees were deployed to set up WiFi in refugee camps and along the migration route. As part of the education portfolio, Googlers will also be offered the opportunity to travel to Guatemala to support Learning Equality in its digital work. Betsy Beaumon, president of Benetech — a previous Google.org grantee under its 2015 focus on disabilities — told Devex that the organisation “has benefited from Google support that goes beyond just direct funding, including volunteer engineers on open source projects, access to expertise on machine learning and even a venue to convene accessibility technologists.” “They understand and support experimental approaches to software innovation that can be seen as messy, involving trial and error and changes in plans,” she said. “This has made projects possible that we could not have otherwise tried. That’s always refreshing in a funder.” For its new focus, the Google.org team did more than 60 interviews with experts to determine whether they could add value to the global education landscape, said Hoyer-Gosselink, who travelled to India over the summer as part of the process. They concluded that there was a need for more flexible philanthropic funding, and that Google.org could add value through its focus on technology and innovation, she said, arguing that many children are in school but not learning: 130 million students do not have basic subjects mastered after four years of primary education, and 74 percent of students have limited or no access to the internet. The organisation is on the lookout for education non-profits “where technology can be a meaningful part of the solution and not forced” and “where we could see impact in the near to medium term,” she said. “We’re here to translate what is possible on the technology side to what is actually needed and can provide the most impact in coordination with our partners and grantees,” she added. The team also plans to measure this work, whether successes or failures, to “contribute to the knowledge base for what is possible at the intersection of education and technology,” she said. It ties into other work the company is doing to spread the availability of technology, and especially the internet, more widely. Fuller told Devex that once the goal of wider connectivity is achieved, “then we can think about: okay, these are areas that are newly receiving the internet, and these are non-profits on the ground we can think about supporting to make sure that new internet availability is leading to high-quality learning.” However, the current commitment is seen as an intermediate step, she explained, and they are interested in working with non-profits that have found new ways to reach students in areas where there is low or intermittent power and internet connectivity. Individuals and organisations interested in learning more about the funding opportunities available can fill out a form. “Technology has the potential to address some of the biggest education challenges in the world’s most underserved communities, through providing teacher support and tools, enabling access to content, empowering students with more personalised instruction and more,” Amy Klement, who leads on education at the Silicon Valley-based philanthropic investment firm Omidyar Network, told Devex. “Like most innovations, much of this is happening already in the world’s wealthier education markets — creating what can be a widening achievement gap that philanthropy can help address,” she said. “In particular, philanthropists can play an important role by increasing access to edtech in communities that need it, funding user experience design and efficacy testing in disadvantaged communities, and showcasing efficacious technology with key local influencers and decision-makers to promote awareness and understanding,” Klement explained. Google.org launched in 2004, when Google co-founder Larry Page said he hoped the institution might one day “eclipse Google itself” in terms of global impact. In 2015, it committed $20 million to building “a more inclusive world” for people with disabilities as part of the Google Impact Challenge. Fuller, who joined the organisation in 2007 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has helped Google move toward its model of corporate philanthropy.

Android O is now official. It’s not surprising that the next major release of Android will be “O” since Google follows the alphabet for its Android updates, but today’s news is significant because Google also revealed some details of Android O. With O, Google is placing a focus on improving battery life. It’ll do this by putting new automatic limits on app background performance in three areas: implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates. Google says that these tweaks should make it so that apps “have minimal impact on a user’s device and battery.” Android O is also bringing notification tweaks. Called “notification channels”, this gives developers more control over different kinds of alerts and also gives users more fine-grained control over the notifications that they see, letting them block or change how each notification channel appears rather than simply blocking all of an app’s notifications. Other new user-facing features of Android O include picture-in-picture for watching video while you’re performing other tasks, adaptive icons that can change shapes and animate interactions based on what the device wants, and keyboard navigation that includes better “arrow” and “tab” navigation. Because this is a developer preview, Google has also announced several new dev-focused features of Android O. These include font resources in XML, wide-gamut color for apps, WebView enhancements, and AAudio API for pro audio. To go along with its announcement, Google is now offering a developer preview of Android O. This update is available for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus Player. You’re going to need to download the system image for Android O and sideload it onto your device if you want to try the preview, though. And keep in mind that this is an early preview, so you may want to avoid it unless you’re a developer. If you do want to give Android O a try, maybe load it onto a secondary device. Google says that it’ll share more details of Android O at its Google I/O conference in May.

Spanky A 6 month delay is surprisingly short. Normally, with Samsung’s already glacial pace of updates and the carriers factored in, it takes a few months longer than that. I do agree completely, though. As someone who wants prompt updates, I would never purchase an Android phone other than the Pixel. Aaron Davis No, they will see it right away. It will take 2 years for the OEMs to get their custom crap-ware working on it, before they give it to us, though. JBLmobileG1 O huh? No deserts or candy names affiliated with it? I was almost certain that they were going to use the name Oreo as the next one. :-p Trevnerdio They always release the preview as just the letter. They called Nougat “Android N” for months after it was announced. Chris Drudge Orange whip (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Whip) would be my preference, but there are other possible “O” desserts that it could be named: http://www.androidcentral.com/android-o-name None sound reasonably good other than Oreo but that would require a branding agreement with Nabisco.

REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker 1/2 left right Fabio Coelho, Google's President for Brazil, speaks as he attends the Google for Brasil event in Sao Paulo, Brazil, March 22, 2017. REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker 2/2 SAO PAULO Google said on Wednesday it would offer an audio-only option on its Duo video calls service to help users communicate using poor-quality connections, and was adding a feature to permit file sharing in group chats on its Allo messaging App. The company launched Google Duo in August, providing video calls for users on Android and iOS, pitting it against Apple Inc's FaceTime, Microsoft Corp's video-calling app Skype and Facebook Inc's Messenger. Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, said audio-only calls on Duo would be available from Wednesday in Brazil, and would be rolled out to users around the world in the coming days. The audio-only calls would work well on all connection speeds and be data efficient, Google Vice President for Product Management Mario Queiroz said in a blog post after he announced the moves at a Google conference in Sao Paulo. With more than 139 million people online, Brazil ranks among the top five internet populations in the world. In response to requests from users in countries like Brazil, Google said that Android users everywhere would be able to share documents and other files (.pdf, .docs, .apk, .zip, and mp3) with friends on Allo in group chats. It also said it was rolling out two new features for Google Photos on Android and iOS to make backup and sharing easier on low connectivity. "Now your photos will back up automatically in a lightweight preview quality that's fast on 2G connections and still looks great on a smartphone," Queiroz said in the blog post announcing the new features. When a stronger Wi-Fi connection becomes available, backed up photos would be replaced with high-quality versions, he added. Google also said it was adding a new location sharing feature in Google Maps to allow users to let friends and family know where they were and when they would arrive at their destination. Users can stop sharing that information at any time, Queiroz said.

Verizon and AT&T joined a list of well-known British brands such as retailer Marks and Spencer Group Plc <MKS.L> deserting Alphabet Inc's <GOOGL.O> Google. Google is under fire in Europe from politicians and brands angered by ads appearing alongside videos on its YouTube platform carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages. Google on Tuesday vowed an overhaul of its practices. The company must act swiftly to ensure that more advertisers do not pile on, analysts say. As advertisers revolt, the search giant faces both a short-term loss of revenue and a long-term danger that companies will lose faith in the automated placement of ads upon which Google has built its empire, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "The bigger risk is this seems to be a backlash against programmatic advertising in general," Dawson said. "There's this worry that you no longer have control over where ads appear." AT&T is removing ads from the non-search inventory on Google because its "ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate," the company wrote in an email. Verizon said it had suspended all digital advertising not related to search after saying earlier on Wednesday that it had only suspended advertising on Google's non-search platforms. It took the action after its ads were appearing on "non-sanctioned websites," a spokeswoman wrote in an email. "We are working with all of our digital advertising partners to understand the weak links so we can prevent this from happening in the future," the spokeswoman said. Google declined to comment on individual customers but said it has begun a review of its advertising policies. The news that AT&T and Verizon were suspending Google ads was first reported by Britain's Times newspaper. Other big brands, such as Mondelez International Inc <MDLZ.O>, were keeping an eye on the situation. While Mondelez has not seen evidence that its ads have appeared alongside inappropriate content, it is in “constant discussion with both Google and YouTube and will be monitoring the issue closely,” a spokeswoman said. YouTube has been a key driver of growth for Google as its traditional business of search advertising matures. Google’s net ad revenue worldwide from YouTube was $5.58 billion last year, according to New York-based research firm eMarketer. It is expected to hit $7 billion in 2017, according to a forecast by eMarketer made before the recent controversy. One question many people are asking is whether advertisers will reallocate the marketing dollars they have devoted to YouTube to other platforms, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. Wieser, however, thinks that if the boycott is widespread enough, no one else will benefit. “If you know all of your competitors are reducing their spending too, then you don’t need to spend more,” he said. Google must walk a fine line between giving advertisers more control and alienating the massive community of content creators who have made the site a top destination for coveted young viewers. One likely path forward for Google is to tighten controls on which videos are eligible for advertising, perhaps by the channel's track record or number of viewers, said Dawson. But any such restrictions risk hurting artists with small followings. "Google is caught between a rock and a hard place here between its creators and its advertisers," Dawson said.

The reasoning stems from the potential for big-name brands’ ads to appear next to videos and other content containing hate speech, including white nationalist, sexist, and homophobic content and videos and sites created by and designed for the purpose of promoting terrorism. Similar to how Facebook has moved to reduce the prominence of fake news, Google is now being pressured through a full-scale boycott to distance itself from hate speech and repair the image of its most lucrative ad platforms. Google is facing a full-scale ad boycott “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate. Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms,” an AT&T spokesperson told Recode today. Verizon followed soon thereafter, saying in a statement also obtained by Recode, “Once we were notified that our ads were appearing on non-sanctioned websites, we took immediate action to suspend this type of ad placement and launched an investigation.” Other companies including car rental firm Enterprise and pharmaceutical company Glaxo Smith Kline, have followed suit. The decision mirrors that of a number of companies in the United Kingdom that began pulling advertising from YouTube last week, following an investigation by The Times of London that discovered those companies’ ads were showing up next to extremist content. That investigation led to hundreds of brands — including McDonald’s, Audi, and Toyota — pulling advertising from Google properties and through the company’s ad exchanges. Google on Tuesday announced that it would work to resolve the issues through a combination of stricter rule enforcement and improved automated and manual moderation techniques. “We don't comment on individual customers but as announced, we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear,” Google said in a new statement given to The Verge today. “We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.” More From The Verge The Hawai’ian volcano that created a spectacular firehose of lava just collapsed Apple, Facebook, Google, and 94 others file opposition to Trump's immigration ban Google’s Super Bowl ad accidentally set off a lot of Google Homes Lady Gaga opened her Super Bowl performance with a protest anthem Trump is turning Elon Musk into a crony capitalist Why the sounds of eating make some people so angry Now Trending Judge Neil Gorsuch failed the horse-sized duck question The Xbox One is struggling because video game exclusives still matter Where have all the Xbox One games gone?

The company has been selling assets like its Craftsman tool brand to offset a lack of customers. But it says its pension agreements may prevent the spin-off of more businesses, potentially leading to a shortfall in funding. ___ Trump's SEC pick, a lawyer for Goldman, to face skepticism WASHINGTON (AP) — Goldman Sachs may be about to get another friend in Washington. Jay Clayton, a well-connected Wall Street lawyer who is President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, is sure to face sharp questions from Democrats in his Senate confirmation Thursday over his years of work for Goldman and other financial giants. ___ Labour nominee says he won't let politics influence hiring WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Labor Department says he won't allow potential political pressure from the administration to influence his hiring decisions. Alexander Acosta tells a Senate committee he regrets that political tests played a role in employment practices used by a subordinate when Acosta headed the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under President George W. Bush. ___ Google's YouTube losing major advertisers upset with videos SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — AT&T, Verizon and several other major advertisers are suspending their marketing campaigns on Google's YouTube site after discovering their brands have been appearing alongside videos promoting terrorism and other unsavoury subjects. The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars. ___ Indexes inch back upward as tech stocks rise; Nike plunges NEW YORK (AP) — US stock indexes shook off a shaky start and finished mostly higher. Technology and industrial companies climbed but banks edged lower as bond yields slipped again. A day after a sharp loss, the market didn't make much headway. Nike plunged after issuing results and an outlook that disappointed investors, and Sears dropped after it said it may not be able to stay in business. ___ For some airline passengers, new warnings bring new hurdles NEW YORK (AP) — As far as the indignities of modern air travel go, the latest ban on laptops and tablets on some international flights falls somewhere between taking off shoes at the security checkpoint and testing baby food and milk for bomb residue. It's yet another impediment in the name of security for already weary travellers, especially those from or passing through the 10 mostly Middle Eastern and North African countries covered by new U.S. and British policies. While not quite as disruptive as an outright ban on smartphones — much less a travel ban based on nationality — the restrictions loom large for some. ___ AP Interview: Emirates defends security as laptop ban looms DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The president of Emirates, the Middle East's biggest airline, defended security measures at the carrier's Dubai hub on Wednesday and said the ban on personal electronics onboard U.S.-bound flights came without warning. Tim Clark told The Associated Press that he only learned of the new U.S. regulations the previous day, saying the carrier "had no prior knowledge whatsoever." ___ Retirement dreams fizzle for some with 'Obamacare' repeal CHICAGO (AP) — Workers dreaming of early retirement are getting the jitters as Washington debates replacing the Obama-era health care law with a system that could be a lot more expensive for many older Americans. The uncertainty over the cost of coverage in the individual market has caused some in their 50s and early 60s to put plans on hold. ___ Australia pair are first foreigners to own US radio stations JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — An Australian couple with roots in Alaska has bought radio stations in three states, marking the first time federal regulators have allowed full foreign ownership of U.S. radio stations. The Federal Communications Commission approved Richard and Sharon Burns' request through their company Frontier Media to increase their interest in 29 radio stations in Alaska, Texas and Arkansas to 100 per cent.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to outside ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "Today's speaker challenged my expectations of the internet and of corporate behavior and stimulated good office discussion." --March 2017 "I dislike most presentations. This was among the best I have ever watched." --March 2017 "SUPER INTERESTING talk!!! Glad I had the opportunity to hear Nir speak!" --March 2017 "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work.

Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security’s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Before teaching at Stanford, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California.

But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S.

Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Deck Host: Jim Cook, CFO, Mozilla Recommended pre-watch: Mitchell’s 2nd Portland Keynote on Decisionmaking October 22, 2015: Data as Empathy with Frances Haugen, Yelp Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, October 22 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: Data As Empathy To build products people love, you must understand those people. User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News. Host: Doug Turner Deck Questions: Submit questions for Deanna during the event on IRC #AirMozilla.

Larger companies that embrace this approach (examples include Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Airbnb and Dropbox) use creativity, analytical thinking, and social metrics to gain product exposure and grow their market share quickly. Speaker: Hiten Shah is cofounder and president of analytics companies KISSmetrics and Crazy Egg; he also advises startups. Host: Jascha Kaykas-Wolff Deck Questions: Submit your questions for Hiten in advance here, or during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. July 23, 2015: Rapid Prototyping with Tom Chi, GoogleX Location: San Francisco + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, July 23 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Tom Chi has worked in disciplines ranging from astrophysical research to Fortune 500 consulting to developing new hardware and software (web & client) products and services. He’s worked on large projects of global scale (Microsoft Outlook, Yahoo! Search), and scaled new projects from conception to significance (Yahoo! Answers from 0 to 90 million users). He also co-founded GoogleX, the semi-secret group responsible for cutting edge projects including the autonomous driving vehicles, contact lenses that monitor glucose through tears and balloons in the stratosphere that provide Internet access. Topic: Tom will talk about his approach to rapid prototyping using 'native' materials like paper and foam core to create and test experiences. Using this method, he has led teams to work more effectively and quickly, building state of the art (see above for examples) products as part of an ongoing innovation process. Host: Josh Carpenter Deck Workshop adapted from Tom's talk, from Mozilla Learning Network Questions: Submit your questions for Tom in advance here. May 21, 2015: Onboarding and Team Debt with Kate Heddleston Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, May 21 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Speaker: Kate Heddleston, a software engineer in San Francisco, does a lot of speaking on the people-dimensions of software development and engineering management best practices. Her focus is on how software gets made, as well as on what it does. Topic: Kate shares her thoughts on the topic of onboarding new hires - what it takes to do that well, particularly in an engineering environment - and the 'team debt' that results when we do it poorly. Kate also shared some of the fairly immediate things individual teams can do to reduce the debt. Deck. Questions submitted to Kate in advance are here.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Brian Fung By Brian Fung March 22 at 5:45 PM Follow @b_fung (Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg News) AT&T and Verizon are withdrawing much of their advertising from Google amid a widening backlash against the Internet giant's algorithmic ad-placement software. Wednesday's decision reflects concern by the country's biggest telecom companies that Google's automated systems could be placing their ads beside extremist content and on websites that promote hate speech. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” AT&T said in a statement. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” In a statement, Verizon said it took “immediate action to suspend this type of ad placement” after it learned that its ads were appearing on “non-sanctioned websites.” Although the decisions do not appear to affect ads that the companies place next to Google search results, they nevertheless cover a wide swath of the Internet that is connected to Google's vast ad network. AT&T and Verizon are among the world's largest advertisers, and their move makes them among the first U.S. businesses to withdraw their marketing after a similar outcry in Europe prompted Google to adjust its advertising policies this week. The Guardian, a British newspaper, pulled its advertising from Google and YouTube this month amid complaints that its ads were appearing next to videos of white nationalists and Islamist extremists. “We’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear,” Google said Wednesday in a statement. “We're also raising the bar for our ads’ policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.” Although tech companies such as Google have sought to position themselves as neutral platforms for technology, their growing role in consumers' everyday lives has forced them to make tough decisions about when and how to manage content appearing on their services. Selling ad space against offensive speech that targets racial minorities, women or other groups, critics argue, also poses an ethical quandary for Google, a company that portrays itself as inclusive and open. Google's advertising operations are highly automated and deal with countless websites around the world. Grappling with hate speech at that scale poses a challenge, company officials conceded in a blog post Monday. But, they vowed, Google will work harder to take down ads when they appear next to content that is deemed hateful. The company also promised to give advertisers better control over where their ads appear — such as making it easier to blacklist certain types of content or sites where an advertiser does not want an ad to show up. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, said audio-only calls on Duo would be available from Wednesday in Brazil, and would be rolled out to users around the world in the coming days. The audio-only calls would work well on all connection speeds and be data efficient, Google Vice President for Product Management Mario Queiroz said in a blog post after he announced the moves at a Google conference in Sao Paulo. With more than 139 million people online, Brazil ranks among the top five internet populations in the world. In response to requests from users in countries like Brazil, Google said that Android users everywhere would be able to share documents and other files (.pdf, .docs, .apk, .zip, and mp3) with friends on Allo in group chats. It also said it was rolling out two new features for Google Photos on Android and iOS to make backup and sharing easier on low connectivity. "Now your photos will back up automatically in a lightweight preview quality that's fast on 2G connections and still looks great on a smartphone," Queiroz said in the blog post announcing the new features. When a stronger Wi-Fi connection becomes available, backed up photos would be replaced with high-quality versions, he added. Google also said it was adding a new location sharing feature in Google Maps to allow users to let friends and family know where they were and when they would arrive at their destination. Users can stop sharing that information at any time, Queiroz said.

Skip to content comics cosplay tv/film games Submit tip Contact CGC Insider Search for: AT&T Pulls Ads From YouTube Citing “Content Promoting Terrorism And Hate” Posted by Gavin Sheehan March 22, 2017 4 Comments Continuing our coverage of #YouTubeAgeGate, this time on the advertisement side of things. AT&T announced today that they are pulling advertisements from YouTube. This comes as a wave of advertisers have started boycotting YouTube because their ads are being placed next to hate speech videos, and the company took a step to cutting ad ties until the problem is corrected. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” AT&T said as part of their statement. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” In a response, a Google rep said “We don’t comment on individual customers but as announced, we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear. We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.” For a few weeks now we’ve been seeing the fallout of YouTube’s Age Gate system take effect on content creators as they now rate channels based on content and set an age limit, but now it appears advertisers are still not happy with the way the system is being run and are taking steps to protect themselves. While AT&T may be a couple drops in the bucket compared to the other companies who pay for advertising right now, they’re also the most prominent name on the list and it could lead to more people leaving as time goes on. This also means that its money lost for content creators who have perfectly fine content and may have been making decent money off of AT&T’s partnership.

Serious Cloudflare bug revealed secret user data from major websites Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key Developers of the popular LastPass password manager rushed to push out a fix to solve a serious vulnerability that could have allowed attackers to steal users' passwords or execute malicious code on their computers. The vulnerability was discovered by Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy and was reported to LastPass on Monday. It affected the browser extensions installed by the service's users for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge. According to a description in the Google Project Zero bug tracker, the vulnerability could have given attackers access to internal commands inside the LastPass extension. Those are the commands used by the extension to copy passwords or fill in web forms using information stored in the user's secure vault. [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] If the extension's binary component is installed, the "openattach" command can be used to run arbitrary code on the computer, Ormandy said on the bug tracker. The LastPass developers deployed a workaround on their server to prevent exploitation and plan to include a full fix in new versions. On Tuesday Ormandy reported another vulnerability in the Firefox extension that, according to the LastPass developers, was related to the first one. That vulnerability was fixed in a new version of the Firefox extension, 4.1.36a, that was released Wednesday. "We have no indication that any of the reported vulnerabilities were exploited in the wild, but we’re doing a thorough review at this time to confirm," the LastPass developers said in a blog post. "No password changes are required of users at this time." To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Several services producing and/or assessment man or woman parts creates a numerous many co-ordination and then effort needs. Business deals get in the way. If perhaps not one but two firms simply cannot correspond direct amongst each other and still have to continually move by means of the particular organization, you have a difficulty.

Hence, your Remote control is to try and reveal with the venture boss, who seem to comes to the material administrators to examine their work in a being employed web-site.

Or DevOps the actual loss of offsite? Certainly not. Associations cannot have all this Doing it proficiency needed in-house. They’ll want to bring understanding with additional shops. Outsourcingtips can be used to sleep in. The advent associated with DevOps and then the really need to effort, speed and even responsiveness to be able to responses you require to take in DevOps would flow to state that long run long term contracts will probably be written with such objectives in view. There’s nothing some sort of silly objectives.

The vulnerability was discovered by Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy and was reported to LastPass on Monday. It affected the browser extensions installed by the service's users for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge. According to a description in the Google Project Zero bug tracker, the vulnerability could have given attackers access to internal commands inside the LastPass extension. Those are the commands used by the extension to copy passwords or fill in web forms using information stored in the user's secure vault. If the extension's binary component is installed, the "openattach" command can be used to run arbitrary code on the computer, Ormandy said on the bug tracker. The LastPass developers deployed a workaround on their server to prevent exploitation and plan to include a full fix in new versions. On Tuesday Ormandy reported another vulnerability in the Firefox extension that, according to the LastPass developers, was related to the first one. That vulnerability was fixed in a new version of the Firefox extension, 4.1.36a, that was released Wednesday. "We have no indication that any of the reported vulnerabilities were exploited in the wild, but weâre doing a thorough review at this time to confirm," the LastPass developers said in a blog post. "No password changes are required of users at this time." ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Faster initial backup and image sharing in Photos is achieved by Google first uploading a “lightweight preview” of pictures when on slower connections, like 2G. Once on a better network, the high-quality version will be backed up to permanently replace the low-resolution copy. Future clicks on the share URL will also show the full image. Given their recent advancements in data and image compression, Google notes that the lightweight preview quality still “looks great” on smartphones. The backup and sharing changes are rolling out starting today on iOS. Aimed at situations where there is a poor network connection, Duo will now allow users to make audio-only calls. Google notes that audio calls work “well on all connection speeds” and is data efficient. This feature will be accessible by swiping down on the main screen of the app and switching between the video/audio toggle. Sliding towards the latter setting brings up a screen where users can start a call. This feature is launching in Brazil starting today, with the rest of the world seeing it in the next few days on iOS.

Google has added an audio calling feature to the app which was launched last summer alongside Allo. Beginning with users of the app in Brazil, Duo will in the coming days be extended to other users globally. The choice of Brazil is explained by the fact that Google wants to increase its [Duo] presence in emerging markets, since the app is designed to cater to the needs of regions with low bandwidth penetration. Mario Queiroz, Vice President Product Management said in a blog post today: “Last year we created Google Duo to bring simple, high-quality video calling to users on Android and iOS. Now we’re adding audio-only calling in Duo. So in those moments when video calling isn’t an option—like when you’re about to hop on a crowded bus or have a poor network connection—you can stay connected with family and friends through audio calling. Duo audio calls work well on all connection speeds and won’t eat up your data. This feature will be available starting today first in Brazil, and we’ll be rolling it out to users around the world in the coming days.” In today’s announcement, Google said the new audio calling feature will work on all connection/speeds, and won’t require use of heavy data. Audio calling is a welcome option for users who will now not be limited to video calling alone. Google Allo was not left out too Google Allo was not left out as Google added a file sharing feature as well as a Smart Smiley in Portuguese. Users will now be able to share documents and other files (. pdf, docs, apk, .zip, and mp3) with friends on Allo. That’s a good one for Allo users because file sharing was in high demand among users of the app; and it’s no wonder Google decided to add it. Also read: Google Allo coming soon to desktop. Google took advantage of the popularity of Allo and some of its other popular apps in Brazil by adding Smart Smiley in Portuguese. This new feature uses machine learning to “help you find the right emoji faster.” To use this feature, simply tap the Smart Smiley icon on the compose bar, and Allo will suggest relevant emojis and stickers to help you finish your thought. Credit: https://blog.google/topics/internet-access/google-brazil-building-more-inclusive-internet-everyone-everywhere/ On the choice of Brazil, Queiroz said: “Brazilians love the internet. With more than 139 million people online, Brazil ranks among the top five internet populations in the world. Brazilians are also heavy users of Google products, from Search and Android to YouTube and Maps to Photos and Waze.” Google also used today’s occasion to announce that Google Maps will soon allow you to share your real-time location with friends and families for up to three days.

Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images By Patrick Kulp2017-03-22 21:27:59 UTC Some of America's biggest advertisers are joining their British counterparts in boycotting Google. AT&T, car rental giant Enterprise, and pharmaceutical company GSK have each decided to suspend all YouTube ads after The Times of London reported that the brands had appeared alongside videos with hate speech and extremism. The companies are among the first in the United States to join what's become a full-scale revolt among advertisers in the UK this week. SEE ALSO: Google finally gives brands more ways to keep ads off hateful Youtube videos The decisions all come the day after Google announced a handful of new tools meant to give advertisers more control over where their ads appear. The search giant has also apologized repeatedly and vowed to beef up the staff dedicated to sussing out extreme content. Apparently the company's assurances weren't convincing enough. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate," an AT&T spokesperson said in an email statement. "Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms." Enterprise took its statement a step further with an indictment of automated digital ads as a whole.  "Programmatic buying is a relatively new advertising 'science,' and has only become mainstream within the last four or five years," an Enterprise spokesperson said. "It appears that technology has gotten ahead of the advertising industry’s checks-and-balances.There is no doubt there are serious flaws that need to be addressed."  GSK said it was encouraged by Google's "first steps" towards solving the problem but would pull ads from all Google platforms until the issue is resolved. "The placement of our brands next to extremist content is completely unacceptable to us and we have raised our concerns directly with Google," a company spokesperson said. "We are encouraged by Google’s steps over the past few days to take action and will continue to work with them to make further progress in developing adequate safeguards to ensure that advertisers are not placed in this position." The companies join British advertisers like HSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland, L'Oreal, ad agency Havas UK, and others that have pulled their spending from Google this week in the wake of reports that ads were appearing on videos from former KKK leader David Duke, a homophobic preacher who praised the Orland nightclub shooting, among other extremists. Google wouldn't comment on the decisions but reiterated that it was working towards fixing the issue. "We don't comment on individual customers but as announced, we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear," a spokesperson said Wednesday. "We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands."   Speaking at the Advertising Week Europe conference in London this week, Google's head of European operations acknowledged that the problem wasn't confined to the UK. It appears he was right. Update March 22, 6:30 p.m. ET: Johnson & Johnson has reportedly pulled its YouTube ads as well.

X Irish brands pull ads from Google in fears over extremist content Core Media, Ireland’s largest ad-buying group, has paused its clients’ campaigns about 17 hours ago Laura Slattery Google chief business officer Philipp Schindler apologised to advertisers, saying Google would take “a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content”         Core Media, Ireland’s largest buyer of advertising, has suspended its business with Google and YouTube over fears that ads are appearing alongside extremist content. The group told clients on Wednesday afternoon that it was pausing all advertising campaigns on YouTube and the Google Display Network until it receives greater reassurances from Google about the placement of ads. The move means Core Media clients including Musgrave, the National Lottery, Aviva and Heineken will not for the moment advertise on YouTube or on the mass network of sites on which Google places display ads. “It’s not about a boycott. It is about a pausing of activity,” said Justin Cullen, chief digital and data officer for the Core Media group. Mr Cullen said Core Media, which purchased about €225 million worth of advertising on behalf of brands in the Irish market last year, had been contacted about the issue by several clients earlier this week. Most of the inquiries came from international groups that had already pulled their advertising from Google in the UK. Major companies from supermarkets to banks and consumer groups withdrew their campaigns in the UK market after their ads appeared alongside YouTube videos carrying homophobic and anti-Semitic messages. Brand safety challenge Core has now decided it will also suspend its campaigns with the Californian technology giant. Core chief executive Alan Cox tweeted that the policy would remain in place until it can be “confident that a solution to the brand safety challenge is in place”. Advertisements on the Google search network are not affected by the withdrawal. Senior Google executives have promised reform of its policies to allay fears. Chief business officer Philipp Schindler apologised to advertisers on Tuesday, saying Google would hire significantly more people to tackle the issue and take “a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content”. ADVERTISEMENT “We feel there is still a fair bit of work to do on their side,” Mr Cullen said. “There’s still a few gaps in the fence.” While only a small percentage of advertising inventory is at risk of being placed beside inappropriate content, “for many clients a very small risk is still too big”.       Topics: Alan Cox Justin Cullen Philipp Schindler Google Heineken National Lottery YouTube Read More Corporate watchdog asks INM for records on mooted Newstalk deal TV licence fee ‘should be doubled’, says RTÉ director general The whistle sounds loud and shrill at INM over Newstalk row INM chief made protected disclosure under whistleblower rules Martin McGuinness: Reaction of British and Irish media to his death Digital ads may become less annoying under new plan Half of Irish NGOs lack an investment policy INM’s digital media strategy has yet to pay dividends Google to revamp policies and hire staff after UK ad scandal The stakes have risen since Murdoch’s last battle for Sky Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Markets Stocks and bonds rally on interest-free ECB cash Technology Control your home heating on the go with Hub Controller Rugby England poised to have the Lion’s share in touring squad Innovation Swedish minnow Volvo drives ahead with autonomous cars Sponsored Our trip North: ‘I couldn’t believe how much it had changed’ Who are the ‘Leaders of Tomorrow’?

Schindler said that the company would take “a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content.” On Friday, the U.K. arm of the Havas agency said it would halt spending on YouTube and Web display ads in Google’s digital advertising network, NPR reported. Havas agency’s clients include the BBC and Royal Mail. Havas UK CEO Paul Frampton said he had a duty to protect clients and “ensure their brands are not at all compromised” by appearing alongside or seeming to sponsor content from extremists. Google vowed to institute a number of changes, including tightening its ad policies and giving advertisers the ability to “fine-tune where they want their ads to appear.” The move may rebut criticism that the website has not done enough to curb online hate speech — but will also thrust Google further into the public debate over political ideology and censorship.

AT&T, Verizon, Enterprise and Johnson & Johnson have halted ads on certain Google platforms after major brands learned their promotional posts were appearing alongside extremist content. "We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate," a spokesperson for AT&T said in a statement to CNNTech. "Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms." (AT&T has agreed to acquire Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. The deal is pending regulatory approval.) A spokesperson for Verizon said the company "took immediate action to suspend this type of ad placement" and has "launched an investigation" into the issue. Laura Bryant, a spokeswoman for Enterprise, said the car rental company has temporarily halted all of its YouTube ads. "There is no doubt there are serious flaws that need to be addressed," she said in a statement. Johnson & Johnson said in a statement that it has decided to "pause all YouTube digital advertising globally to ensure our product advertising does not appear on channels that promote offensive content." An investigation published last week by The Times in London revealed that ads from brands like the BBC and L'Oreal were placed near inappropriate content on YouTube posted by religious extremists, a Ku Klux Klan leader and more. The British Government, Havas, The Guardian and others halted their Google ads after the investigation. Matt Brittin, head of Google's European business, apologized this week to "our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content." Google followed up by announcing plans to boost resources for reviewing content and to make it easier for brands to control where their ads appear. "We don't comment on individual customers but as announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear," a spokesperson for Google said Wednesday. Google's ad sales still account for the overwhelming majority of its overall revenue, even as the company expands into hardware, self-driving cars and life sciences. "Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem," Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group, wrote in an investor note this week.

March 23rd 2017 15 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Google Maps launches a location sharing service that has privacy implications. Picture: AP Photo/Patrick Sison Rod ChesterNews Corp Australia Network GOOGLE Maps has finally caught up with Apple in letting users share their location. But while it’s now easier to make sure you meet up with friends, there are also privacy concerns of how the service can be abused. Apple users for a long time have been able to share the location with their friends, either with the app Find Friends or, more recently with Apple Maps and Messages. But the Google sharing announced today goes a step further, with the ability to follow friends around a map in real time. The feature, which will be rolled out to users around the world soon in an app update, lets anyone with Google Maps share their location with a friend, regardless of whether both or either have an Android or Apple iOS phone. To start sharing location, you open Google Maps and tap “share location”. You then select who to share it with and how long you want to share it. The person, or people, you have selected, will see an icon of your on their map, and you see an icon on your map as well, reminding you that you are sharing. One likely use for the feature is when you’re trying to meet friends. Share your location and they can then navigate to you. But you can also share trips. If you’re driving home from work, before you start your journey you share a trip with your family so they can track your progress through the traffic. You can turn off sharing at any time on your phone, the person you are sharing your location with can turn off sharing, and you can set the period of your sharing from 15 minutes to three days. If you turn on sharing with an unlimited time period, Google will send you an email every few weeks to point out that someone is tracking your location at every moment. For parents who want to make sure their kids are on the right train home from school, you can imagine this can be handy — although that is assuming the child is willing to have sharing turned on. The latest Google Maps update is a privacy killer! https://t.co/XimY8Ctn6G— NetamakerIndia (@netamakerIndia) March 22, 2017 Why can't my mum just accept "out" as an answer to where I'm going, she needs the post code & an image on google maps and my location— ㅤ (@LiamMc_01) March 3, 2017 Or if you’re wanting to know if it’s time to put dinner on before your partner walks in the door, you can check how they’re travelling in the traffic — again, assuming they have turned on sharing. But what are the downsides? Do teenagers have a right to their privacy from their parents? Could an abusive partner demand that their spouse always turn on location sharing so that they check their every move? If a spouse is willing to turn on location sharing, do they have something to hide? And when you go through a relationship breakup, do you have to remember that part of the checklist of giving your ex back their crappy DVDs you also have to turn off location sharing?

The reason is simple: The confusing maze of versions of the OS and the need to somewhat differently configure each for the variety of device manufacturers and networks upon which they run creates cracks and crevices through which clever, and even not so clever, crackers and malware distributors can do damage. Google, which claims that it is reacting to the challenge, this week released its third annual Android Security Year in Review. One of the key tools is Verify Apps, which continually patrols users’ devices for potentially harmful applications (PHAs). Google said that Verify Apps conducted 750 million daily checks in 2016 compared to 450 million the year before. Overall, Google’s efforts have cut problems significantly, at least according to the company. The report says that Trojans are now 0.016 percent of installs, a 51.5 percent drop compared to 2015. Also dropping overall and compared to 2015: hostile downloaders (0.003 percent; 54.6 percent), backdoors (0.003 percent; 30.5 percent) and phishing apps (0.05 percent; 0.15 percent). An example of the type of attention being paid to security was the removal of a family of potentially harmful applications, Threat Report reported last week. Chamois malware potentially manipulated ad traffic, sent premium text messages and downloaded more plugins. Researchers said that the malware featured a multistage payload and custom encrypted storage, and constantly changed its file format. While that’s pretty clearly good news, Google is not out of the woods. Far from it. Macworld offers an Android versus Apple iOS comparison. Unsurprisingly, considering its name, the story notes that the site “sit(s) unashamedly in the iOS camp.” Still, the piece seems fair. The first section deals with security. The main takeaway is that one demographic group in particular really likes Android: the bad guys. Pulse’s 2015 Mobile Threat Report estimates that 97 percent of mobile malware is written for Android. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said that only 0.7 percent of malware aimed at iOS. The reason is simple: It's easier to break into Android, and malware writers will almost always go for the low-hanging fruit. Not all the problems are Google’s fault. Last week, Check Point Software reported that severe infections were found on 36 Android devices sent to two companies. The problems were introduced after the devices left the factory and before they arrived at the customer premises. This suggests that Google’s supply chain is not secure. Google is making progress in its security efforts and significant dangers exist. The two facts are not contradictory. Hopefully, the balance will continue to tilt toward progress and away from insecurity as time passes. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up The controversy erupted last week after the London-based Times newspaper reported that some ads were running with YouTube videos that promoted terrorism or anti-Semitism. The U.K. government and the Guardian newspaper took down ads from the video site and Havas SA, the world’s sixth-largest advertising and marketing company, pulled its U.K. clients’ ads from Google’s display ad network and YouTube. On Wednesday, the boycott spread across the Atlantic as U.S. companies that are among the heaviest ad spenders pulled back, potentially costing Google and YouTube hundreds of millions of dollars in lost business. AT&T and Verizon Communications Inc., the largest U.S. wireless carriers, said they had stopped non-search advertising spending with Google. Johnson & Johnson, the world’s biggest health-care company, paused all YouTube advertising globally. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” a spokeswoman for AT&T said in a statement Wednesday. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” To shield its brand, Verizon took the same action. It’s also started an investigation, Sanette Chao, a Verizon spokeswoman, said in a statement. Search represents the lion’s share of Google’s advertising revenue, which totaled $79.4 billion last year. However, large advertisers such as AT&T tend to spend more heavily across Google’s video and display advertising network. AT&T is the fourth-largest advertiser in the U.S., spending $941.96 million in 2016, according to Kantar Media, and Verizon is No. 3. Google’s network business, which serves display ads on other websites, generated $4.4 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, about 20 percent of the company’s total ad sales. While YouTube revenue isn’t reported separately, analysts estimate the video site brings in billions of dollars each year, and say it’s among Google’s fastest-growing businesses. “American advertisers making statements will cause American investors to pay infinitely more attention to an issue that is already gripping much of the industry,” said Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research Group, which downgraded Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s stock on Monday over the issue. Google tried to head off the backlash this week, implementing new tools and policies. But many advertisers were waiting to see further details or results, before placing ads again. Sainsbury’s Plc, the British Broadcasting Corp., Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and Havas each said Wednesday that their decision to pull ads from YouTube hasn’t changed following Google’s announcements. Brentford, U.K.-based GlaxoSmithKline Plc, one of the biggest drug makers, joined the boycott on Wednesday.  "The placement of our brands next to extremist content is completely unacceptable to us and we have raised our concerns directly with Google," the company said. "We are encouraged by Google’s steps over the past few days." A representative for Google declined to comment on individual customers. “As announced, we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear,” the representative said. “We’re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers’ brands.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Posted 23 Mar 2017 04:15 Updated 23 Mar 2017 16:05 The Verizon logo is seen on the side of a truck in New York City, U.S., October 13, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc said on Wednesday they have suspended digital advertising on Google's YouTube and other advertising platforms not related to search over concerns that their ads may have run next to extremist videos. Verizon and AT&T joined a list of well-known British brands such as retailer Marks and Spencer Group Plc deserting Alphabet Inc's Google. Google is under fire in Europe from politicians and brands angered by ads appearing alongside videos on its YouTube platform carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages. Google on Tuesday vowed an overhaul of its practices. The company must act swiftly to ensure that more advertisers do not pile on, analysts say. As advertisers revolt, the search giant faces both a short-term loss of revenue and a long-term danger that companies will lose faith in the automated placement of ads upon which Google has built its empire, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "The bigger risk is this seems to be a backlash against programmatic advertising in general," Dawson said. "There's this worry that you no longer have control over where ads appear." AT&T is removing ads from the non-search inventory on Google because its "ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate," the company wrote in an email. Verizon said it had suspended all digital advertising not related to search after saying earlier on Wednesday that it had only suspended advertising on Google's non-search platforms. It took the action after its ads were appearing on "non-sanctioned websites," a spokeswoman wrote in an email. "We are working with all of our digital advertising partners to understand the weak links so we can prevent this from happening in the future," the spokeswoman said. Google declined to comment on individual customers but said it has begun a review of its advertising policies. The news that AT&T and Verizon were suspending Google ads was first reported by Britain's Times newspaper. Other big brands, such as Mondelez International Inc , were keeping an eye on the situation. While Mondelez has not seen evidence that its ads have appeared alongside inappropriate content, it is in “constant discussion with both Google and YouTube and will be monitoring the issue closely,” a spokeswoman said. YouTube has been a key driver of growth for Google as its traditional business of search advertising matures. Google’s net ad revenue worldwide from YouTube was US$5.58 billion last year, according to New York-based research firm eMarketer. It is expected to hit US$7 billion in 2017, according to a forecast by eMarketer made before the recent controversy. One question many people are asking is whether advertisers will reallocate the marketing dollars they have devoted to YouTube to other platforms, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. Wieser, however, thinks that if the boycott is widespread enough, no one else will benefit. “If you know all of your competitors are reducing their spending too, then you don’t need to spend more,” he said. Google must walk a fine line between giving advertisers more control and alienating the massive community of content creators who have made the site a top destination for coveted young viewers. One likely path forward for Google is to tighten controls on which videos are eligible for advertising, perhaps by the channel's track record or number of viewers, said Dawson. But any such restrictions risk hurting artists with small followings. "Google is caught between a rock and a hard place here between its creators and its advertisers," Dawson said.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed New York’s ‘unconstitutional’ right to be forgotten bill sparks concern 22 Mar 2017 2 Law & order, Privacy Post navigation Previous: Soundwaves used to produce fake data from accelerometers Next: Rise of the Twitterbots increases pressure on Twitter chief Dorsey by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit New York state politicians have introduced a right-to-be-forgotten bill that would require the removal of some online statements about others. To be exact, statements that are judged “inaccurate”, “irrelevant”, “inadequate” or “excessive.” New York Assembly Bill 5323 was introduced by David Weprin and as Senate Bill 4561 by state senator Tony Avella. Eugene Volokh, who teaches free speech law at the University of California-Los Angeles School of Law, analyzed the bill in an article published by the Washington Post on Wednesday. Here’s what the bill would do: Within 30 days of a ”request from an individual,” “all search engines and online speakers shall remove… content about such individual, and links or indexes to any of the same, that is ‘inaccurate’, ‘irrelevant’, ‘inadequate’ or ‘excessive,’ ” “and without replacing such removed… content with any disclaimer [or] takedown notice.” “‘[I]naccurate’, ‘irrelevant’, ‘inadequate’, or ‘excessive’ shall mean content” “which after a significant lapse in time from its first publication” “is no longer material to current public debate or discourse”, “especially when considered in light of the financial, reputational and/or demonstrable other harm that the information… is causing to the requester’s professional, financial, reputational or other interest”, “with the exception of content related to convicted felonies, legal matters relating to violence, or a matter that is of significant current public interest, and as to which the requester’s role with regard to the matter is central and substantial.” The bill would cover the following wide range of online publishers, running the gamut from search giants like Google all the way down to ordinary individuals like you and me: …search engines, indexers, publishers and any other persons or entities which make available, on or through the internet or other widely used computer-based network, program or service, information about an individual… Failure to comply would carry fines of at least $250/day, plus attorney fees. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More The bill contains no exception for materials of genuine historical interest, as Volokh pointed out. Nor would it exempt autobiographic material, whether it’s found “in a book, on a blog or anywhere else,” he said. Ditto for information on political figures or celebrities. From Volokh’s analysis: So, under this bill, newspapers, scholarly works, copies of books on Google Books and Amazon, online encyclopedias (Wikipedia and others) – all would have to be censored whenever a judge and jury found (or the author expected them to find) that the speech was “no longer material to current public debate or discourse” (except when it was “related to convicted felonies” or “legal matters relating to violence” in which the subject played a “central and substantial” role). The bill aims for censorship with a “broad, vague test based on what the government thinks the public should or shouldn’t be discussing,” Volokh says. It is clearly unconstitutional under current First Amendment law, and I hope First Amendment law will stay that way (no matter what rules other countries might have adopted). Remember: There is no “right to be forgotten” in the abstract; no law can ensure that, and no law can be limited to that. Instead, the “right” this aims to protect is the power to suppress speech – the power to force people (on pain of financial ruin) to stop talking about other people, when some government body decides that they should stop. Europe and other countries have for years been successfully forcing Google to enforce right to be forgotten laws across as many of its domains as possible. Google’s been kicking and screaming the whole way. Things are different in the US, where the First Amendment and the public’s right to know are deeply embedded in the culture. In 2014, for example, a San Francisco Superior Court judge upheld the then-already widespread legal opinion that search results constitute free speech. But then again, Americans also value the right to privacy. Hence, in 2015, California adopted the Online Eraser Law, which gave California minors a narrow but significant right to be forgotten. Meant to save minors from having social media posts dog them throughout their adult lives, it was the first state law of its kind. How does the NY bill compare to Europe’s right to be forgotten? For one thing, the European Commission has made it clear that the courts meant for journalistic work to be protected when they passed the right to be forgotten judgment. Debate over the judgment, and the competing values of privacy vs the public’s right to know, has been passionate. The EU Court of Justice has gone so far as to publish a list of myths about the right to be forgotten. Two of the myths, it says: that the judgment contradicts freedom of expression, and that it allows for censorship. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has heartily disagreed with the notion that those are myths, warning that the right to be forgotten will lead to a form of cyber-mad cow disease, or what he termed “an internet riddled with memory holes”. In comparison, the NY bill is toddling into this contentious debate practically stripped of any exceptions at all for freedom of speech and with no signs that it’s been crafted to protect against censorship. However, it’s in the proposal stage at this point and could well be amended. I’ve reached out to the bill’s authors for their reaction to charges that their bill is unconstitutional and will be used as a tool of censorship. I’ll update the article if they get back to me.

Noting a lot of users have requested the ability to share documents in group chats, Google said that Android users everywhere can now share documents with friends on Allo, including files like PDF documents, ZIP archives, MP3 tracks and more. Google didn’t say when file sharing might hit Allo for iOS, but it shouldn’t be too long. Users in Brazil can now take advantage of the app’s Smart Smiley feature in Portuguese. Smart Smiley uses machine learning to help you find the perfect emoji. Like Apple’s tap-to-emojify feature in the stock Messages app on iOS 10, Google’s implementation requires you to tap the Smart Smiley icon on the compose bar. Like magic, Allo suggests relevant emojis and stickers to help you finish your thought. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube The search company recently updated Allo for iPhone with a trio of new features: animated emoji, a redesigned GIF picker and and one-tap Google Assistant.

Verizon and AT&amp;T joined a list of well-known British brands such as retailer Marks and Spencer Group Plc deserting Alphabet Inc's Google. Google is under fire in Europe from politicians and brands angered by ads appearing alongside videos on its YouTube platform carrying homophobic or anti-Semitic messages. Google on Tuesday vowed an overhaul of its practices. The company must act swiftly to ensure that more advertisers do not pile on, analysts say. As advertisers revolt, the search giant faces both a short-term loss of revenue and a long-term danger that companies will lose faith in the automated placement of ads upon which Google has built its empire, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "The bigger risk is this seems to be a backlash against programmatic advertising in general," Dawson said. "There's this worry that you no longer have control over where ads appear." AT&amp;T is removing ads from the non-search inventory on Google because its "ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate," the company wrote in an email. Verizon said it had suspended all digital advertising not related to search after saying earlier on Wednesday that it had only suspended advertising on Google's non-search platforms. It took the action after its ads were appearing on "non-sanctioned websites," a spokeswoman wrote in an email. "We are working with all of our digital advertising partners to understand the weak links so we can prevent this from happening in the future," the spokeswoman said. Google declined to comment on individual customers but said it has begun a review of its advertising policies. The news that AT&amp;T and Verizon were suspending Google ads was first reported by Britain's Times newspaper. Other big brands, such as Mondelez International Inc , were keeping an eye on the situation. While Mondelez has not seen evidence that its ads have appeared alongside inappropriate content, it is in "constant discussion with both Google and YouTube and will be monitoring the issue closely," a spokeswoman said. YouTube has been a key driver of growth for Google as its traditional business of search advertising matures. Google´s net ad revenue worldwide from YouTube was $5.58 billion last year, according to New York-based research firm eMarketer. It is expected to hit $7 billion in 2017, according to a forecast by eMarketer made before the recent controversy. One question many people are asking is whether advertisers will reallocate the marketing dollars they have devoted to YouTube to other platforms, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. Wieser, however, thinks that if the boycott is widespread enough, no one else will benefit. "If you know all of your competitors are reducing their spending too, then you don´t need to spend more," he said. Google must walk a fine line between giving advertisers more control and alienating the massive community of content creators who have made the site a top destination for coveted young viewers. One likely path forward for Google is to tighten controls on which videos are eligible for advertising, perhaps by the channel's track record or number of viewers, said Dawson. But any such restrictions risk hurting artists with small followings. "Google is caught between a rock and a hard place here between its creators and its advertisers," Dawson said.

Google reports that at the end of 2016 about 0.05% of all devices, that only downloaded apps from the Google Play Store ,was infected with some kind of malware. The year before that number was 0.015%. About 0.016% of all apps installed through the Google Play Store in 2016 contained a trojan, a decrease of 51.5% compared to the year before. Also the amount of malcious downloaders, apps with a backdoor and phishing apps, decreased with respectively 54.6%, 30.5% and 73%. Google did see an increase of the percentage of Android devices on which malware is installed, from 0.5% in 2015 to 0.71% last year. This number includes all Android devices, also those with apps that are installed from other sources than the Google Play Store. In its blog Google also reports the way and how fast older Android devices receive security updates. The company is criticized for the fact that many Android owners have to depend on phone manufacturers, and not Google, for security updates. Updates are therefore much slower released that needed, or are not released at all for older devices.   Of all Android devices that were in use last year, about 50% didn’t receive a security update. The company hopes to change that this year by , “streamlining our security update program to make it easier for manufacturers to deploy security patches”.

Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 You may not have heard of Dakele or Eton or K-touch but, till three years ago, they were among some 500 smartphone brands jostling for a slice of the ample Chinese mobile phone market. By 2016, that number may have come down to 100 and among the casualties were Dakele, Eton and K-touch, which had become China's no. 3 mobile phone vendor after Nokia and Motorola in 2009. According to a March 2016 report in South China Morning Post, the three Chinese smartphone makers had suspended operations amid fierce competition, low profits and unsettled debt. A similar scenario is waiting to play out in the world's second largest mobile handset market after China that's estimated to be worth $15 billion. It's the sheer size of the market — some 220 million units of smartphone and feature phones are sold in a year in India — that's tempting new players to take the plunge, even as some old ones bite the dust. So if you have Bollywood icon Salman Khan readying plans to launch a BeingSmart range of phones — an extension of sorts of his Being Human apparel range — one-time leader Nokia will make a comeback with a 2G feature phone and three smartphones to be launched by June. The Chinese juggernaut continues to rumble, led by top labels such as Xiaomi, Gionee, Vivo and Oppo, with a protracted tail comprising lesser known brands such as Huachin, Longcheer, Konka. Many more, including K-Touch, are watching from the sidelines and contemplating if it is worth stepping on to the crowded field. Together, these obscure brands control a 46% share of the Indian handset market. But fortune is fickle and several brands — LeEco, Miezu and Celkon — with pan India ambitions have had to scale back or exit. Celkon wanted a pan India footprint but has been unable to make a dent outside southern pockets. Smaller cities such as Jaipur, Udaipur, Vijaywada and Visakhapatanam have their own local flavours. Often started by former distributors, who "know the supply chain and market," brands with alluring names like Kool, Sunny and Vijay keep popping up and disappearing—much like frequently installed and deleted apps. Pan India brands such as Micromax and Karbonn that once looked set to challenge the leaders find themselves swamped by competition. Karbonn has exited the Rs 10,000-plus category to focus on mass market models up to Rs 7,000 while Micromax is betting on cheaper models, hoping to ride on demand generated by Reliance Jio Infocomm's offer of free voice for life. Micromax, till recently second in the pecking order, does not count among the top five smartphone brands. Jaideep Mehta, managing director, IDC, India & South Asia, said, "Players that were strong three years ago have fallen off the volumes charts. Karbonn, at one point, looked like threatening Samsung's hegemony but is now a niche player. Recently, a Chinese brand that spent Rs 80 crore a month on advertising exited, unable to convert ads to sales. Innumerable traders (lift-ship-andsell models) have burnt their fingers." LIFT, SHIP AND SELL Market watchers say there are 200 companies in India, mostly local brands. Pan India players would number 40-50, including Apple, Samsung, Oppo, HTC, Lenevo, Vivo, Gionee, Google Pixzel and Xiaomi. New labels keep showing up. Part of the reason for the plethora, apart from the huge market, is that you can simply place an order for shipment over the phone. Not surprisingly, employees in the trade keen to make a fast buck see entrepreneurial hopes in selling handsets. Original design manufacturers (ODMs) in China will be happy to ship phones on any given specs and there are all types. For instance, there are ODMs that won't accept orders below a quarter million handsets and others that will make just 10,000 units of a device on order. The latter cater to the local players looking to a make a fast buck. Such fly-by-night businesses — called trading models in market parlance — have limited shelf life. Sudhin Mathur, managing director, Motorola Mobility & Lenovo MBG India, said, "They are not the ones that will survive." Dinkar Ayilavarapu, partner at Bain and Company, believes such players are not significant any more. "You need inhouse R&D, new models, a service network and innovation to survive. Even small-town buyers are getting educated about brands, which makes it tough for traders to survive." Yet, many keep coming as the sub-Rs 10,000 market accounts for bulk of the purchases and is a commodity play — little innovation, just a cheap handset that meets basic communication and messaging needs. Recently, Taiwan's HTC exited this segment to focus on the high end. Faisal Siddiqui, president, HTC South Asia, said, "We were never into feature phones and never played strongly in the sub-Rs 10,000 market. We sell between Rs 12,000 and Rs 20,000 with innovation as the key." HTC also makes Google Pixel devices, which, at the high end, compete with Apple and Samsung brands like S7 Edge. Ayilavarapu reckons that 190 million out of 220 million handsets sold are below Rs 10,000. At the entry level, Itel of China offers devices for as low as Rs 700 while almost 100 companies would be vying for a share in this segment—most betting on feature phones (See graphic on feature phones to smartphones shift). But to sustain business and break even, "companies need to sell at least one lakh devices a month, not an easy ask for a trader who doesn't want to spend on marketing, distribution or aftersales service," said MS Malik, managing director, Pacetel Systems, a telecom distribution firm. Small traders depend on selling via local TV channels rather than a formal distribution route that can be more expensive (See online-offline distribution graphic). CONSOLIDATION AHEAD Manu Jain, managing director, Xiaomi India, said, "About eight years ago, the China smartphone market was similar to where India is now. The Chinese market has consolidated, with the top 6-7 players accounting for an 80% share. In India too, there will be consolidation." For this, M&As are unlikely but outright exits expected. Shashin Devsare, executive director, Karbonn Mobile said, "Companies that don't sell at least one million devices a year will be pushed out." He believes there are 85 smartphone brands and over 150 in feature phones. "Those that don't differentiate and neither have deep pockets to sustain will hit a dead end." Karbonn itself has had to rejig strategy by getting out of the fiercer Rs 10,000-plus category to focus on below Rs 7,000 phones. At the beginning of 2016, Karbonn was selling about one million handsets a month; that number has now halved. While the fragmented market makes it a slog for all players, Indian brands particularly have found the Rs 10,000-plus segment difficult to crack. "Most brands are copycats. When you copy, the quality is not as good as the original," said Malik. Often the only difference is the camera resolution. "They don't invest in R&D, which can be at least 25% of the capital expenditure," Malik said. That's unlike most Chinese, Korean and Taiwanese brands that have their own design, R&D and manufacturing. Gionee has a 1,600-strong R&D team while Xiaomi has inhouse R&D and a network of 300 service centres, besides call centres to answer queries. Lenovo has 14 models at any given time in the Rs 4,500-40,000 bracket. "It's an unforgiving market. If you don't have a new product every few months, buyers will switch to any of the other brands," said Mathur. In the past, lack of innovation has brought global majors Nokia and Blackberry to their knees. Nokia is now trying to make a comeback. Ajey Mehta, vice-president at HMD India, which has licenced the Nokia brand, said, "We are banking on partnerships with Google, Foxconn and Nokia, which should help us in a market with undifferentiated products." Foxconn makes the phone while Google ensures a rich Android experience. Recently, at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona, Finlandheadquartered HMD Global showcased a new-look Nokia 3310 2G feature phone, in addition to a clutch of smartphones. Whether Nokia can still be adept at 'connecting people' now depends on how many young Indian consumers recall the brand — or its slogan. Redeeming Features Loaded feature phones have slowed shift to smartphones India is the world's largest feature phone market and will remain so for a while. This despite several brands, including HTC, Gionee and Lenovo offering only smartphones. Arvind Vohra, MD, Gionee India blames it on lack of internet education of buyers. "The first device for many buyers continues to be a feature phone." While cheaper feature phones account for about 140 million units a year sales in the 220-million devices market, by value, it's the smartphones that score—almost $12.5 billion to the $2.5-billion feature phone sales. In fact, the `15,000-25,000 market — entirely smartphones — has doubled in the past year, accounting for 35% share of all smartphones sold. With 4G's arrival and a data pricing war triggered by Reliance Jio Infocomm, you would expect smarter devices to fly off the shelves. Not quite. The pace of the shift to smartphones has slowed after the initial burst in 2013, when feature phones comprised 85% of the market; that's now down to 55%. In developed markets such as China and Europe, feature phones account for less than 15% of the total (in China, it's less than 10% and now most manufacturers have stopped selling feature phones there). Dinkar Ayilavarapu, partner, Bain and Company, says, "It will take eight to 10 years for India to be a 100% smartphone market. It's a scenario that's much like CRTs (the bulky TVs), which continued in India long after they stopped selling around the world. In a few years, it won't be viable to produce feature phones; that could be a turning point." The government's push for digital payments and Aadhaar-enabled services could also accelerate the shift to smartphones. Sudhin Mathur of Lenovo's mobile business group is optimistic smartphones will dominate in three years. Manu Jain, MD, Xiaomi India, believes 90% of phones sold will be smartphones in five years. Sky Li, president, Oppo India, believes lack of connectivity is also delaying the shift. "While affordability does contribute a lot to high usage of feature phones, it is not the sole reason. Several corners of the country are still facing connectivity issues," Li points out. Jaideep Mehta, MD, IDC, India & South Asia, sees feature phones themselves getting smarter and a possible blurring of the line between feature and smartphones. "There's lot of functionality being built into feature phones, like minimal browsing and enabling payments." There are feature phones that run on 4G SIMs, trying to upgrade to smart category. As component prices drop and manufacturers can pack more in cheaper phones, feature phones could morph quickly into smartphones. Online or Offline? It's A Fine Line Online accounts for a fourth of handset sales and could go up to half by 2020 About five years ago, online sales of smartphones comprised less than 5% of all sales, as consumers preferred to touch and feel before buying. That changed with brands such as Xiaomi, Google Pixel, Motorola and OnePlus selling online only. Today, 25-30% of 220 million units are sold online annually and this could up to 50% by 2020. Most recent launches have been online only as companies save costs and test market reaction. These include Nubia Z11 Mini S, Xiaomi Redmi 4A, Moto E3. Manu Jain, MD, Xiaomi India, says,"Offline distribution and marketing costs are high — the device ends up being 20% dearer for the buyer." National, state and city distributors each pocket 2-5% of handset cost and the retailer margin is 5-8%. Xiaomi claims almost a third of the share of online sales and some 10% of the overall smartphone pie. Lenovo claims two-thirds of its sales come from offline channels. Sudhin Mathur of Lenovo says, "Shoppers who are more aware come online." However, HTC of Taiwan sells only offline. "80% of the market is offline. Why go after the smaller pie?" asks Faisal Siddiqui, president, HTC South Asia. Xiaomi claims it can derive more bang for the buck by saving on distribution costs. But its planning to increase its offline presence this year. "We will sell more offline, but online will still comprise 70-75% of our sales," says Jain. Dinkar Ayilavarapu, partner Bain & Company, says distribution strategy depends on the strength of the brand. "It's an overcrowded market. How you execute the go-to-market strategy is critical for survival. New brands entering now will compete with at least 50 other brands, Online selling is cheaper to test the market. Brands will go offline only when they see consumer response." Even Salman Khan doesn't want to take chances and is reportedly going online first for the 'Being Smart' range of Android phones, shipped from factories in China and targeted at the mid-market (Rs 12,000 -20,000). Will that keep the box office ringing? Innovators and the Me-toos R&D spend will differentiate the quick from the dead Apple and Samsung top the charts in mobile phone R&D spends, figuring among the world's top 20 spenders on innovation. What comes out of the labs is critical to market share in smartphones where shoppers can ditch brands that aren't futuristic enough. Lessons that the once fancied Nokia and Blackberry learnt the hard way. In the long term, the smartphone could morph into an augmented reality machine, helping you see more than what your eyes can at any location. Smartphone could control your car, or be a 24x7 assistant, with tghe ability to respond to your thoughts! That may sound outlandish but that's what geeks hope all the f a ster process -ing and number crunching capabilities can help achieve. However, in the nearer term, manufacturers are grappling with more mundane issues that will help them get a better market share. Innovation focus is on longer lasting batteries, better selfie experience, better cameras and foldable screens. The last one will alllow users to expand the five-inch screen to an eight inch one, helping them do more. Sky Li, president, Oppo India, says, "There's a strong demand for a good front camera, given the ongoing selfie trend." Arvind Vohra, CEO, Gionee India adds, "The key motivator to upgrade is to capture selfies and surf. So our focus is on HD quality screens, sel fie camera and bat tery." HTC focuses a lot on audio innovation, apart from cameras and design. Lenovo offers options of modular technology phones—users can attach JBL speakers and a Hasselblad camera as separate modules. Indian companies, however, are yet to make a mark on the innovation scale, preferring reliable mass market models than cutting edge. Says a market expert who wished not to be named, "R&D costs are 22-25% of capital expenditure. Not many companies are willing to spend that kind of money as margins are thin. That's why cool innovation is seen mainly in models that sell above `20,000. The rest are popular, copy cats, banking on rivals ideas."

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Swatch is developing its own smartwatch OS, coming in late 2018 03/19/2017 at 11:01 AM by Brad Linder 1 Comment Want to launch a new smartphone? Then you’re probably going to want to load it up with Google’s Android operating system. Android dominates the smartphone space, and unless your company’s name is Apple, odds are you’re not going to have a lot of success selling a non-Android phone. But what if you want to launch a new smartwatch? Things might not be so cut and dry in that emerging space yet. At least that’s what Swiss watch maker Swatch seems to be hoping. Bloomberg reports that Swatch is developing its own operating system for wearables, and plans to launch its first smartwatch powered by the software by the end of 2018. There area already a number of players in the smartwatch OS space. Apple has a version of iOS that runs on its Apple Watch. Samsung uses a Tizen Linux-based operating system for its Gear line of wearables. And a whole bunch of companies including Motorola, LG, Huawei, Fossil, and Tag Heur have adopted Google’s Android Wear platform. But while there are probably more watch models using Google’s software than any of the alternatives, Android Wear is actually on fewer wrists than the competition. Industry watches say Apple’s WatchOS and Samsung’s Tizen watches have the top market share, and while some predict that Android Wear could gain a larger portion of the market (particularly as Pebble/Fitbit loses ground), it’s not clear how accurate predictions will be in this market that’s still relatively new and unpredictable. All of which is to say… maybe Swatch’s decision to build its own platform isn’t as crazy as it sounds. There may be room for yet another smartwatch operating system… if it turns out that there’s enough demand for smartwatches in the first place to justify the amount of effort watch makers and tech companies are pouring into smart wearables. Swatch says its operating system will let you connect one of its Tissot branded watches with a smartphone, and that it will consume less power than competing platforms, leading to longer battery life. That may be good enough if you only want a watch that can display smartphone notifications and perform some other basic functions. But if you want a watch that can run a wide range of third-party apps, it remains to be seen whether Swatch will be able to compete with Apple, Google, and Samsung, all of which have already attracted third-party developers to their platforms. via Pocket Lint Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 1 Comment on "Swatch is developing its own smartwatch OS, coming in late 2018" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest mike moller Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Samsung confirms Galaxy S8 will feature Bixby voice assistant 03/20/2017 at 11:32 AM by Brad Linder 4 Comments Apple may have kicked off the recent virtual assistant craze with the launch of Siri. But these days Siri has a lot of company: Microsoft Cortana, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant (which might have the least creative name of the bunch). Soon they’ll be joined by Samsung’s Bixby. We’ve known it was coming for a while. But now Samsung has confirmed that an early version of Bixby will launch alongside the Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone. @evleaks Samsung is expected to officially unveil the phone at an event on March 29th and it should start to ship in April. The phone will have Bixby software baked in, along with a dedicated button on the side of the device that lets you activate the service when you don’t want to use a voice command. Of course, the Galaxy S8 will also run Google Android software, which means that you can use Google’s voice services. But Samsung is hoping Bixby stands out due to its integration with Samsung products and a few additional features including the ability to give you full control over apps that support Bixby. Once an app is Bixby-enabled, Samsung says anything you could do with touch commands can also be accomplished by voice. When the Galaxy S8 launches, Samsung says only a “subset of preinstalled applications will be Bixby-enabled,” but the company expects the list to grow… and Samsung will released an SDK to help third-party developers add Bixby support to their software. It’s the kind of move that would probably be doomed to failure if it were coming from a different company: why would Android app developers add support for a virtual assistant from HTC, Sony, or LG when they could just tap into Google Assistant to enable voice support across a wider range of current and upcoming Android devices? But Samsung is currently the world’s top smartphone maker, so the company might actually have the clout to pull this off. On the other hand, Samsung’s past attempts to run its own app store, video store, and other alternative-to-Google features haven’t always been successes. Bixby could go either way.

No doubt Google’s keeping a close eye on all these personalized assistant versions to decide whether to jump into the pool with them. From a marketing POV, it can certainly help, if done right.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. Herein lies the issue with Samsung devices. Everything they’ve added to Android just manages to slow it down in spite of the powerful hardware the phones are built upon. This is one of the big reasons I switched to iOS – there’s really no reason on earth a $700+ flagship should lag at all and I found out that it really seems to be just Samsung devices. Other flagship devices seem to fly in the face of Samsung phones. Anyway, since I’m kind of dying to switch back to Android, it’ll be interesting to see what kind of real world performance the S8 puts out. While I doubt I’ll pick up another Samsung, it should at least preview what’s coming to the next Pixel phones.

Google just announced a handy new Maps feature that should make it easier to find your friends on your next night out. On the iOS and Android versions of the app, you'll be able to share your location with anyone in real time. The people who you share your location with will be able to see where you are on Android, iPhone, the mobile web, and even a desktop. Google expects to start rolling out the feature worldwide some time "soon," according to a blog post from Maps Engineering Manager Daniel Resnick. Google Maps Adds Real-Time Location Sharing Whether you think it's creepy or awesome, real-time location sharing is coming to Google Maps http://bit.ly/2mtJLj0 Posted by PCMag on Wednesday, March 22, 2017 When it launches, you'll just need to open the side menu or tap the blue dot that represents where you are to share your location. From there, tap "Share location," select who to share with and how long, and the app will let you send a link to the recipient with your whereabouts. "When you're sharing your location, the people you've chosen to share with will see you on their map," Resnick explained. "And you'll see an icon above the compass on your own map reminding you that you're actively sharing your location." Rest assured that you can change your mind and stop sharing your location whenever you want. Related 23 Google Maps Tricks You Need to Try 23 Google Maps Tricks You Need to Try You can also share your location from navigation to let your friends know exactly where you are and when you'll arrive. Just tap the "More" button at the bottom of the navigation screen, then press "Share trip." "When you share your trip with people, they'll see your expected arrival time and can follow your journey as you head toward your destination," Resnick wrote. "Sharing automatically ends when you arrive." Google released a version of this in 2009, dubbed Latitude. It offered up a user's rough location, placing their profile picture on a map accessible through a PC or mobile device. Eventually, Google added check-in functionality to Latitude as a challenge to Foursquare, but Latitude was axed in 2013 as Google tried to push people to Google+.

AT&T, Verizon and Enterprise have halted ads on certain Google platforms after major brands learned their promotional posts were appearing alongside extremist content. “We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,” a spokesperson for AT&T said in a statement to CNNTech. “Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” (AT&T has agreed to acquire Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. The deal is pending regulatory approval.) A spokesperson for Verizon says the company “took immediate action to suspend this type of ad placement” and has “launched an investigation” into the issue. Laura Bryant, a spokeswoman for Enterprise, said the car rental company has temporarily halted all of its YouTube ads. “There is no doubt there are serious flaws that need to be addressed,” she said in a statement. An investigation published last week by The Times in London revealed that ads from brands like the BBC and L’Oreal were placed near inappropriate content on YouTube posted by religious extremists, a Ku Klux Klan leader and more. The British Government, Havas, The Guardian and others halted their Google ads after the investigation. Matt Brittin, head of Google’s European business, apologized this week to “our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content.” Google followed up by announcing plans to boost resources for reviewing content and to make it easier for brands to control where their ads appear. “We don’t comment on individual customers but as announced, we’ve begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear,” a spokesperson for Google said Wednesday. Google’s ad sales still account for the overwhelming majority of its overall revenue, even as the company expands into hardware, self-driving cars and life sciences. “Overall, we think that the problems which have come to light will have global repercussions as UK marketers potentially adapt their UK policies to other markets and as marketers around the world become more aware of the problem,” Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group, wrote in an investor note this week.

Well, Google Maps may have come up with a solution for that with their latest parking feature which, it seems, would help drivers pinpoint their car and also has a countdown timer. A Google spokesperson said: “We’re testing out a new parking feature and hope to bring it to users worldwide soon.” (Patrick Sison/AP)   The specifics of the tool have not been confirmed, but if the launch of the feature goes ahead, it will mean people can not only use a parking pin to remind them where their car is, but that Google will also tell them the best way to get back to it. Here’s how reports suggest it would work: after downloading maps on Google Play store, you use the blue dot to mark your location and save your parking. As well as dropping a pin on the map, you can also record the row and level you parked in, which would be handy if you live somewhere with lots of multi-story parking. [Read more: How to use Google Maps] Another feature being tested is a countdown timer which could notify drivers how long they have left on a ticket, meaning less of a risk of pesky fines. (Screengrab/Google blog)   And if you need to meet someone back at your car, for example, you will also be able to share this information with other people in the future. A new feature announced in a blog means Google Maps users worldwide will soon be able to share their real-time location with anyone. You can do this by sharing with Google contacts or by sending a link through messenger apps. If you’re running late, you will also be able to share your real-time location and trip progress from navigation. Sounds like driving to meet friends and family could get a whole lot easier in the future. Read more: Trouble finding a parking space?

Columnist Jim Yu discusses how to find and address these issues. Jim Yu on March 22, 2017 at 12:59 pm More Over the past two decades, as the online world has experienced exponential growth, websites have become increasingly complex. Web pages have evolved from simple HTML pages with a few graphics to responsive, personalized pages that focus on the user experience. In tandem with the growing sophistication of websites, customers’ quality standards have also matured. For example, customers have come to expect that websites load quickly, regardless of the device they are using. In 2009, a mere 5 percent of people expected load times of one second or less on e-commerce sites. Six years later, in 2015, a survey found that this number had increased to nearly a third of all customers, with 30 percent expecting pages to load in one second or less. As web pages have evolved, however, the potential for problems has increased. Even seemingly small issues can drastically impact site performance, hindering visitors’ ability to find the content and information they want. Such site issues can quickly damage the reputation of brands in the eyes of customers — not to mention damage web traffic and hurt search engine rankings. Given the competitive nature of the digital ecosystem, no organization can afford unchecked issues that will hurt their ability to engage their audience. Avoiding such problems comes down to a thorough site and content audit, allowing brands to correct issues and errors before they hurt site growth. Ideally, problems can be uncovered in content and web pages before they go live. Audits also empower brands to continue to manage what the customer sees and ensure organizational departments are working in tandem on site projects. The devastating impact of site issues Website issues have the potential to be devastating for brands. A great example, as mentioned above, is poor page speed. Akamai’s recent Consumer Web Performance Expectations Survey found that nearly half of all consumers expect a web page to load in two seconds or less. Worth noting among the insights gleaned from that survey: As consumers’ expectations for page load-speed increases, their patience for slow-loading websites decreases. Currently, only 51% of consumers “wait patiently” for a website to load, compared to 63% who would “wait patiently” five years ago. In other words, if your site isn’t loading quickly enough, chances are that you’re losing more customers with each passing second. Site speed is also not the only issue that will adversely impact success. For example, when customers land on a website from a referral site, half will proceed to the navigation menu to orient themselves. Brands that have unclear, dysfunctional navigation systems that do not function as users would expect stand to lose these visitors. Additionally, 38 percent of people will stop engaging with a website if they do not find the content and the layout attractive. The design of the site matters, and failing to account for this can result in higher bounce rates and poor engagement. Source: Adobe, The State of Content Report 2015 Discussion of common site problems would not be complete without mention of the various errors that can be penalized directly by Google. Site issues that result in duplicate content or poor-quality, thin content will not only create a negative user experience but will also risk hits from the Google algorithm, further lowering your rankings and thus reducing your visibility on the SERPs. This reduced visibility can result in fewer clicks and lost revenue. A poor user experience will also hurt the brand reputation, hindering the organization’s efforts to build rapport with their users and discouraging visitors from engaging with the site in the future. Given that there are billions of websites on the internet, customers have plenty of options when it comes to having their needs met, and competitive brands cannot afford this loss. The site audit three-step solution To avoid these common pitfalls, brands need to run a thorough site audit to identify errors and correct them, while also implementing a system that empowers them to prevent potential problems in the future.  Here is a three-step process you can use to ensure that your site audit uncovers all potential problems and protects your site rankings and the engagement of your visitors: Step 1: Identify errors and spot anomalies The first stage will be to run a complete site audit to look for any problematic pages or page anomalies that could be hindering the success of your site. This audit should include checking site speed, finding page errors, looking for incorrect page redirects and faulty links, and anything else that might sabotage a positive user experience. Matt Cutts, formerly of Google, has remarked in the past that a top error among marketers is failing to make  a page fully crawlable. However, this should be the first priority of any site audit. He also said that people often do not consider keyword phrases and how people search.  For example, if your customers often ask questions such as, “How do I make a pizza?,” then including that exact phrase in your content will provide you with more of a boost than just starting an article listing the ingredients. This attention to wording and phrasing that match consumer intent should also carry over to the descriptions and titles, particularly on the most prominent and important pages. Step 2: Prioritize by severity Not all issues and errors will have the same level of impact on site performance and users. It is important to first fix the errors that will make the most difference. Focus first on any errors that directly impact the visibility or navigation of your site. For example, if a page has been accidentally blocked from Google, that should be the first item on the list. Also look at redirects, error pages and broken links. Next, move on to content issues, including page titles and meta descriptions. Ensure that appropriate keyword phrases are used, that there is no duplicate content and that thin material is either rewritten or removed. At the end, you will be looking more at schema markups, missing alt tags on images and similar issues that may have arisen. Step 3: Fix the errors throughout your site Set up 301 redirects to ensure people arrive at the page they intended to. If you have removed a piece of content, then remove the link or redirect people to the content’s new home rather than allowing them to go to an error page. Check all robots.txt on your site to ensure Google can find what it should. After running your initial audit, make sure those managing the website understand best practices for redirecting users to minimize these errors moving forward. Include a content audit to check for duplicate or thin content. Remove any content that is duplicated, and rewrite any material that is thin and offers little to no value to the reader. Focus on including information that customers want to read rather than just producing material to fill space. Communicate SEO best practices to your site contributors. Make sure they understand the value of using various SEO elements, including meta descriptions, identifying keywords and topics and structuring text in a reader-friendly manner, which includes headings and short paragraphs. Check your page load speed with the Google Developer tool, and use suggestions to improve the efficiency of your site. Mark up all pages with structured data (where appropriate) to help Google recognize their place and value. This is particularly true for local marketing pages and pages that can receive Google’s rich displays, such as Quick Answers. Comb through pages to find missing alt text, tags and related markup errors to help boost performance. Site problems can tremendously reduce website engagement, which will ultimately lead to loss of revenue. In today’s competitive digital landscape, brands simply cannot neglect the structure of their websites. A successful site audit run at regular intervals, in tandem with major site events such as migrations, can help brands avoid mistakes and keep a site, and its revenue, running smoothly.

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) Featured, Google, Storage Google Invests in Avere, a Data Center Storage Supercharger by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on March 22, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet Why spend on flash data center storage when you can make your disk storage cluster behave like flash? That’s the rhetorical question Avere Systems asks its potential customers. Its appliance and software, when put “in front” of a massive disk storage repository in a customer’s data center or in the cloud, accelerates data delivery to and from applications to nearly match the speed of flash that sits in the same data center as the compute resources. This week, the Pittsburgh-based company announced a $14 million Series E funding round from five existing investors and one new one: Google. Some of Google’s enterprise cloud customers use Avere to accelerate performance of their cloud servers used in combination with locally attached flash storage in Google data centers. Notably, the investment did not come from GV, the venture capital arm of Google’s parent company Alphabet, but from Google itself. Avere is an important partner in Google’s effort to lure more enterprises into its data centers. See also: Google Opens a New Front in Cloud Price Wars Ronald Bianchini, an Avere co-founder who serves as the company’s president and CEO, describes the technology’s primary function as “hiding latency” to and from an enterprise data center storage cluster or in a public cloud. Its software works with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure too. Bianchini is a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, one of the leading schools in the field of file systems, which has been a reliable source of engineering talent for his company. Before starting Avere he served as a senior VP at the enterprise storage giant NetApp, to whom he sold his previous company, Spinnaker Networks. The latest funding round, which also includes Menlo Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Tenaya Capital, and Western Digital Capital, brings Avere’s total money raised to $97 million, and Bianchini believes it will be the company’s last. “This is the money that gets us to profitability,” he said in an interview with Data Center Knowledge. Cloud Business Catches Up with On-Prem Avere started by selling its gateway appliance, which is really good at identifying and caching data applications use on its own flash storage and serving that data to the applications. Lately, however, it’s been doing more and more business in the cloud, where companies use its software to accelerate the way cloud VMs work with cloud storage. Recently it reached a point where half of its revenue comes from cloud deployments, which are growing much faster than its on-premise data center business. “Avere is an enterprise data center company whose technology is incredibly applicable to the cloud,” Bianchini said. “For enterprise to adopt cloud, eliminating that latency is critical.” The gateway model works for hybrid cloud deployments too, where a customer deploys the appliance between their public cloud VMs and their on-prem data center storage. They can also use the appliance for disaster recovery; it can send copies of a storage repository to multiple sites or multiple cloud providers. Some customers use their local mass filer for one copy, and public cloud for another, Bianchini said. This functionality could be used to avoid going down when a big cloud provider suffers a major outage like the one AWS suffered in February.

Google says it is adopting stricter advertising rules to combat harmful and inappropriate content. 22 Mar 2017 20:14 GMT US & Canada, Science & Technology Google is one of the biggest companies in the world, but that doesn't make it invincible. The British government, and several big businesses including Audi and McDonalds, have pulled their advertising from Google sites like YouTube. They have confronted the company for playing their ads next to videos they consider extreme - ones that promote violence or hate speech. It is a situation that has global implications. Google has already apologised and promised to take what it calls a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. So, who's to decide which content should be removed?

Whether you want to keep track of guests as they arrive at your place, engaging in sketchy Craigslist meetups, Tinder hookups, whatever — sometimes it’s just nice to know where someone is without having to ping them every step of the way. Google is finally making this possible in the one app it should have been available all along: Google Maps. In a new update rolling out on Android and iOS, Maps users will be able to share their location with friends or family, allowing these people to track them in real-time. It’s not half as creepy as it sounds and Google is providing a handful of options that put the user in full control of their location sharing with the ability to share only for a specific amount of time, auto-shut off, and the ability to kill sharing at any time. The option to share your location also pops up when navigating to a destination, making the question “where are you?” officially obsolete. The best part about location sharing in Maps is that it works with both your Google contacts, or anyone else by simply sharing a link with them. When they click it, they view your location in the Google Maps app, mobile web, or even their desktop. Not too long ago Google rolled out a separate app for keeping track of loved ones called Trusted Contacts, but was billed as more of a “personal safety app” in the event of an emergency. Maps is much more social, easier to use, and in the place where it makes the most sense.

On a PHA level, Google is still doing a bang-up job on not letting through many bad apps that could do you harm, but the security patch situation still isn’t great even after a solid year of improvements. For the year 2016, only about half of Android devices even received a security update. Woof.  Before we get into the security update stuff, let’s talk numbers for those worried about installing bad apps. If you only install apps from Google Play, Google found that only 0.05% of devices contained a PHA. That’s down from 0.15% in 2015 and essentially means  you have almost zero chance of downloading something bad from Google Play. Now, we know that some of you love to get in on some free .apk action outside of Google Play, so you might be a little worried about your chances of getting hammered with a PHA, right? Google says that just 0.71% of all Android devices had PHAs by the end of last year. That’s a slight increase from 0.5% in 2015, but still a pretty small number. Thankfully, Google says that they are now “using improved tools” and have gained new knowledge that should help them further reduce that in 2017. OK, so about security patch updates – what’s the deal with only half of devices receiving them? It’s complicated! But yeah, Google said in its report that “more than 735 million devices from 200+ manufacturers received a platform security update in 2016.” With 1.4 billion devices in the wild, that’s not exactly a great number. Additionally, Google and its partners pushed updates for “over half of the top 50 devices worldwide” in the last quarter of 2016 alone. Again, that’s fine, but we’re still hovering around that 50% mark here. Of course, the monthly security platform program is still pretty new and there is work to do for phones outside of Nexus and Pixel. Google thinks it can improve upon the program as partners have invested “significantly” in regular updates and Google itself will be “streamlining” the process by making it “easier for manufacturers to deploy security patches.” Google told TechCrunch that they have already cut wait time for security patches down from weeks to “just a few days” in some cases. Finally, if it makes you feel better, Google also says that 78% of flagship devices in North America were up-to-date at the end of 2016. As has been the case the past couple of years, it still sounds like Google has PHAs under control, but is still struggling to get manufacturers to buy into releasing security patches. How do they convince them that security is important? That I do not know, but these companies should probably jump on board before they regret having out-of-date phones and something serious happens. The full report can be read below or there is a 30 minute overview video down there too.

I was expecting less. hkklife If you put non-carrier devices into that mix (ie wi-fi tablets), I bet that % would plummet. Even though we had many reasons to hate them, you gotta admit that the carriers at least hold the OEM’s collective feet to the fire as far as issuing some kind of security updates. Historically, I can can recall several instances where a carrier-branded version of a tablet got more/longer updates than the “retail” wi-fi variant. The OG Galaxy Tab 7″ and Xoom 2 /Xyboard come immediately to mind. WK Shouldn’t it be “oof” instead of “woof”? Every time I see that, I picture a dog typing up the article. discopunkk I was thinking the same thing especially since in a certain segment of the population “woof” has a very particular meaning LMAO moew DEAR SAMSUNG, Monthly patches for your unlocked USA devices, or I’m never buying again. I don’t care if it’s 2 months back, but just be consistent. S7 U version here, abandoned by samsung. DanSan The problem is with android, there are so many old phones and tons of these low to mid range phones that get released and never see an update in their lifetime. That’s not Google or Android fault, its the manufacture. Johny Bravo Its mainly google fault, as they let manufacturers use their google play services, they can demand timely updates from vendors. But they are not enforcing this. MadMartigan They can try…and watch as the flood of cheap GMS devices dries up and and they lose a large chunk of the low-to-middle end market to Android devices without GMS. Johny Bravo actually contract between vendors and google says, that they cannot create android devices without GMS, if they are creating devices with GMS, so this is not an issue MadMartigan That “contract” would be for OHA membership. If you are not a member, it does not apply. See: Xiaomi. MaryWalker111 98856➤➤➤➤➤HTTP://InComeEarnAtHome.eu.gp macewank This is correct. The problem is that Android still hasn’t managed to separate the OS layers such that they can push security patches to OEM devices without impacting OEM customization. That was *supposed* to be one of the key features of.. gosh.. maybe ICS? It was an old update that was supposed to start working towards that, so your devices worked like this at low level: Carrier Layer (Verizon) OEM Layer (TouchWiz) OS Layer (Android) And they were supposed to be able to update any one of those layers without needing to touch the other. Was never fully realized, and this is what we get now. Marissaekelly Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Still getting them regularly. AnotherAndroidKid Actually it is not perfect for nexus and pixel phones either. My Nexus 6 is still stuck on the October 2016 update. There is zero excuse for that. Although the more research I do, I see it is an artifact of being in the beta program at one point and now unable to change beta status. BS either way. moew You still use a N6? LOL I’ll bet you have huge biceps at this point in life. Beta program is beta, nobody to blame but yourself. needa Somebody that owns an unlocked GS7 should not be throwing stones. moew Beta program is beta, nobody to blame but yourself. Ryan B I will agree that your Nexus 6 still being on October 2016 security patch isn’t right. You should be getting monthly security updates through this Oct/Nov. I myself have been in the Beta program awhile and it hasn’t affected me at all. My phone(Nexus 6P) has received security patches every month since purchasing it on launch day…except for in February when I did not receive one. I am up to date as of right now with the latest security(and beta) patch. I have to say though it did disappoint me a little to see Google falter on that security patch. I purchased that phone BECAUSE Google said there will be at least 2 years of OS updates and 3 years of monthly security updates. P.S. I will give Google credit though, they have been, at least for me, been doing what they said they would do…minus this little snafu in February. Johny Bravo crap is still crap go to https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html and see for yourself (hint: nougat is still on less than 3% of android devices) MJ That’s cool and all but this post is about security updates NOT OS updates. Android Bug Pity Google can’t put security updates on phones via an app that they can update via Play Store to circumvent the carriers. hkklife Google could if they truly wanted to (ala BlackBerry) but they cannot be bothered.

 AT&T and Verizon pull ads from Google over extremist videos Steve Kovach Mar. 22, 2017, 4:00 PM 12,026 facebook linkedin twitter email print AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson. Alex Wong/Getty Images AT&T and Verizon are pulling their ads from YouTube and other sites that run Google ads after it was revealed that some of their ads have appeared next to extremist videos on YouTube. The move represents a significant escalation of a business problem for Google.  AT&T and Verizon are among the world's largest brand advertisers, and their decisions to temporarily stop buying YouTube ads could cause other big US advertisers to follow suit. "We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate," an AT&T spokesperson told Business Insider in a written statement. "Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms.” "Once we were notified that our ads were appearing on non-sanctioned websites, we took immediate action to suspend this type of ad placement and launched an investigation," a Verizon spokesperson told Business Insider. "We are working with all of our digital advertising partners to understand the weak links so we can prevent this from happening in the future." The two companies will continue placing ads that show up next to Google search results. The Times first reported that AT&T and Verizon were pulling their ads from Google. Shares of Google were roughly flat in late trading on Wednesday. Verizon and AT&T are two of the largest US advertisers, and pulling spending from Google is a significant blow to the tech giant. The two companies are the latest to pull ads from Google following an investigation by The Times that showed some UK government ads running alongside videos for extremist groups like ISIS, indirectly providing money to those groups. Google's chief business officer Philipp Schindler promised in a blog post this week to provide advertisers with more ways to control what content their ads appear against.

By the end of last year, less than 0.71 percent of Android devices had installed a "potentially harmful application," such as spyware, a Trojan, or other malicious software. That figure was even lower, at 0.05 percent, for Android phones that downloaded apps exclusively from the Google Play store. The internet giant revealed the figures in a new report detailing its efforts to making the Android OS secure. Thanks to better app review systems, the company is detecting and cracking down on more malware. However, Google still hasn’t fixed one nagging complaint about Android: the lack of periodic security updates. By the end of 2016, about half of Android devices -- 735 million -- had received a security patch issued during the year, according to the report. That means another half hasn’t, leaving the vulnerabilities in those phones unfixed. How recent was that patch? It’s not clear in the report, but any phone not running the latest Android software can face some security risks. A big reason for the inconsistent patching is because the Android OS is used by hundreds of device manufacturers and across thousands of phone models. So it's up to vendors and the mobile phone providers to push out new security patches, but not all of them do. That can be especially problematic when a major flaw in Android is found and needs to be fixed. Google is aware of the problem. It's been pushing the whole Android handset industry to deliver updates in a timely manner. And those efforts, appear to be paying off. "In Europe, over 73 percent of active flagship Android devices on the major mobile network operators reported a security patch level from the last three months," the report said. In the U.S. that figure was 78 percent and included phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, LG G5, and the Moto X Play. "There's still a lot of room for improvement," Google's Android security team said in blog post about the report. Google's process on the patching front hasn't been perfect, said Andrew Blaich, a security researcher at mobile antivirus provider Lookout. But overall, the company is moving Android OS security in the right direction. "Many of the newest enhancements, especially in [version] 7.X that buyers of the newest Android phones will start with, are much better than they were in the prior versions," he said in an email. Consumers using older Android phones won't be able to reap all these security benefits. But Google is also cracking down on many malicious apps, and reacting quickly to stop them, Blaich said.

Google today announced updates to a trio of its apps. First up is Google Duo, which is gaining support for audio calls. While Duo is focused on video calling, Google is adding support for audio calls for times when video isn’t a good option, like if you’re in a crowded space or you’ve got a less-than-great cellular connection. Audio calling support in Google Duo is launching in Brazil today and will roll out to everyone around the world in the coming days. The next Google app getting some love today is Allo. Google Allo is gaining support for file sharing in chats, meaning that you’ll be able to share .pdf, .doc, .apk, .zip, and .mp3 files in Allo conversations. Allo users in Brazil are getting Smart Smiley support in Portuguese, too. Finally, Google Photos is getting improvements to backup and sharing. When you’ve got a low-speed connection, Google Photos will back up a “lightweight preview quality” of your images that will backup fast but still look good on a phone, Google says. When you hop back onto a speedy Wi-Fi connection, those lightweight images will be replaced with high-quality versions. Google is also making it easier to share photos when you’ve got low connectivity. If you decide to share images when you’ve got a weak connection, Google Photos will send them at a low resolution initially, then update with a higher resolution version when your connection improves. The Google Duo and Google Photos updates are coming to Android and iOS users, while the Google Allo file sharing will be rolled out to Android users.

We don’t know the name of Android O yet, but we got our hands on the long list of new features. For a first release, there’s a good amount of new stuff to check out. Watch the video above to see the new features in action. There’s also a lot of under-the-hood stuff that you can read about below. 1. Settings App Google has reorganized the Settings app once again. Everything has been condensed so it’s not such a long page of categories. For example, “Apps & notifications” are bundled together in one place. Instead of “About phone” there is a broader “System” category. Some categories have “Advanced” sections that can be expanded to show more settings. All in all, it makes the Settings much easier to navigate. 2. Notifications Notifications received a few big changes. First, you can snooze any individual notification that comes in. It’s like Inbox’s snooze feature for emails, but for notifications. Simply slide a notification to the side to reveal a clock icon. Tap the icon and it will be snoozed for 15 minutes. Tap the time again and you’ll get options for 30 minutes, 1 hour, and don’t snooze. There’s also a new thing called “Notification channels.” This allows apps to define notifications to different categories, which can then be fine-tuned by the user. So maybe an app has a category for weather alerts and a different category for breaking news. You can decide exactly how notifications show up from each category. 3. Picture-in Picture Android TV PiP allows video apps to play videos in a floating window while you use other apps. This was introduced on Android TV a while ago, but now it’s available on phones. The feature doesn’t currently work with any apps in the Android O Dev Preview. 4. New System UI Tuner options The secret System UI Tuner has a few new tricks. You can change how the nav buttons are displayed with a compact mode or move them slightly to the left or right. It’s broken right now, but you can also add extra buttons for shortcuts. The lock screen shortcuts can also be customized with the System UI Tuner. 5. Battery improvements Sometimes app consumer more battery in the background than they should. In Android O, this is being addressed by apps having their background status revoked a few minutes after the app is closed. Instead, developers now need to set their server checks up as a scheduled job, so the system can handle that particular job in a more efficient way and ensure it can’t interfere with other background apps or execute more tasks than it needs to. Under the Hood Autofill API: Users will be able to choose an autofill app just like they choose a keyboard. The autofill app stores and secures user data, such as addresses, usernames, and even passwords. Adaptive icons: Adaptive icons can be displayed in different shapes depending on the mask selected by the device. Font resources in XML: Apps can now use fonts in XML layouts as well as define font families in XML, declaring the font style and weight along with the font files. And much more: Read our full Android O announcement post for more gritty details about the new features in this developer preview!

Credit: Chris Rank/Bloomberg News AT&T has halted its advertising with Google for anything but keyword search, becoming the latest major marketer to pull back after an uproar over ads running beside offensive videos on YouTube. Related Stories Google Admits Brand Safety Is a Global Problem How Brands Demanding Safety Could Curtail YouTube Ad Sales Havas Freezes All Google and YouTube Ad Spend in the U.K. "We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate," a spokeswoman for AT&T said in a statement. "Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms." The controversy erupted last week after the London-based Times newspaper reported that some ads were running with videos that promoted terrorism or anti-Semitism. The U.K. government and the Guardian newspaper pulled ads from the video site and Havas, the world's sixth-largest advertising and marketing company, pulled its U.K. clients' ads from Google and YouTube. Search represents the lion's share of Google's advertising revenue, which totaled $79.4 billion last year. However, large advertisers such as AT&T tend to spend more heavily across Google's video and display advertising network. AT&T is the fourth-largest advertiser in the U.S., spending $941.96 million in 2016, according to Kantar Media. Google tried to head off the backlash this week, implementing new tools and policies. But many advertisers were waiting to see further details or results, before placing ads again. Sainsbury's Plc, the British Broadcasting Corp., Toyota, Volkswagen and Havas each said Wednesday that their decision to pull advertisements from YouTube hasn't changed following a statement Monday from Google that sought to reassure advertisers about stricter safeguards. "We don't comment on individual customers but as announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear," a Google spokesperson said in an email Wednesday. "We're also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers' brands." AT&T's move shows the ad boycott isn't ending, but expanding. "American advertisers making statements will cause American investors to pay infinitely more attention to an issue that is already gripping much of the industry," said Brian Wieser, analyst with Pivotal Research Group, which downgraded Google parent Alphabet's stock on Monday over the issue. -- Bloomberg News In this article: Digital Digital Video Media Most Popular Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2017 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17

Happens to us all the time, and it can be frustrating to take the time to reply back when you're already scrambling to leave the house, or about to walk in the door.  Google Maps is introducing a feature to help curb some of this modern-day inconvenience by turning on real-time location sharing. Soon, users worldwide can let family and friends know their exact location for as long a duration as they like.  The feature works on both iOS and Android, and folks you're sharing your location with can view where you are on Android, iPhone, mobile web browsers and desktop. Google made a video to illustrate how real-time location sharing works: If you're still reading, here's how it works: To activate, head into the side menu in Google Maps or tap on the little blue dot and select "Share location."  Pick who you want to share your spot with using Google contacts and the length of time you want your whereabouts known. From here, contacts will see you in their Google Maps. You can turn off location sharing at any point in the journey. Location sharing can also be activated while you're in navigation mode. When you're in the midst of a trip, hit "More" on the bottom of the screen and select "Share trip." Your chosen contacts will get an ETA and can track the progress of your trip. Sharing will turn itself off once you arrive. This is just the most recent helpful new feature to make it onto Google Maps in recent days. The navigation service introduced features to help you remember where you parked earlier this week. Gear up for Google IO 2017, where we'll see Android O and more!

Name: Subject: Message: Google says Android security update speeds should get better in 2017 Newsby John Callaham18 hours ago 8 447 12 Timely security updates for Android devices are becoming more and more important, due to the increase in the number of Android phones on the market, as well as the growing number of malware and other threats from cybercriminals. Today, Google pledged to offer faster Android security patches in 2017, but it also admitted that about half of all Android devices that were in use by the end of 2016 did not get a security update in the previous year. See also: Samsung will finally offer monthly security updates for its US unlocked phones 1 week ago Google launched its monthly security update program for Android in 2015. In a blog post today it stated that in 2016, over 735 million devices from over 200 OEMs received some kind of security patch. It added that those updates were rolled out for over half of the top Android 50 devices worldwide in the last quarter of 2016. According to Google, the following devices received security patches to the highest degree: Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Droid OPPO A33W Nexus 6P Nexus 5X Nexus 6 OnePlus 3 Samsung Galaxy S7 Asus Zenfone 3 bq Aquarius M5 Nexus 5 Vivo V3 Max LG V20 Sony Xperia X Compact However, the company still has a long way to go to close that gap and get the other half of active Android products covered under its security updates. It stated that it will be streamlining its program in 2017, so it should be easier for device makers to roll out Android security patches in the future. In a chat with TechCrunch, Android security lead Adrian Ludwig stated that it has already reduced the wait time for new security patches in the US down from six to nine weeks to just a few days, in collaboration with both device makers and wireless carriers. He added that at the end of 2016, 78 percent of Android flagship devices in the US had the current security update installed. At the end of 2016, 78 percent of Android flagship devices in the US had the current security update installed Google has also made better efforts to detect what it calls Potentially Harmful Apps (PHAs) in the Play Store.  It stated that its Verify Apps system conducted 750 million daily checks in 2016, up from 450 million in 2015. It said that by the end of 2016, only 0.05 percent of Android devices that downloaded apps exclusively from the Google Play Store contained a PHA, and that number is down from 0.15 percent in 2015. Needless to say, Google recommends that Android users download apps just from the Play Store. If a device downloads apps from multiple sources, the likelihood of getting one that is considered a PHA goes up. Google said that by the end of 2016, about 0.71 percent of all Android devices had PHAs installed, up slightly from 0.5 percent from the beginning of 2015.

There has been strong protests and boycott of ads by major advertisers and this has forced the company to expand their controls. The tech giant said the advertisers will have more say to display of ads on YouTube and other Google networks. The protest was strong in Europe with several companies pulling out their ads from Google's network. The U.K. government joined in protest last week. The guardian, French ad giant Havas, etc. joined the resistance. Companies have made it clear that they don't want ads next to the content that contradict their values. A blog post by Philip Schindler, chief business officer of Google said, "Recently, we had a number of cases where brands' ads appeared on content that was not aligned with their values. For this, we deeply apologize. We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us." He added that Google have made a public commitment to give brands more control over where their ads appear. Schindler said there will be changes in ad policies, enforcement and new controls for advertisers. Google plans tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. They will try to remove ads from derogatory content attacking religion, race or gender. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The Top Green Companies on Earth Killer Wheels: RTT's Top 10 Vehicles of 2016 5 Numbers To Remember The Legendary Jack Nicklaus 1986 Masters Win Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories U.S. Weekly Jobless Claims Unexpectedly Climb To 258,000 ECB Says Eurozone Growth Momentum To Continue Focus On Capitol Hill May Lead To Choppy Trading - U.S. Commentary ConAgra Brands Updates FY17 Forecast After Weak Q3 Results UK Retail Sales Rise For First Time In 4 Months Wall Street Enthusiastic Ahead Of Yellen's Keynote Speech Pepsi And Coke Pulling Large Bottles From Philly Stores Over Soda Tax European Shares Fluctuate Ahead Of Yellen's Speech Asian Shares Rise Ahead Of Key US Healthcare Vote Thousands Of AT&T Workers On Strike In California And Nevada European Shares Seen Ticking Higher Ahead Of US Healthcare Vote RARE's Seizure Study Fails, HTGM Soars After-hours, NTEC Awaits Data In Q3 Asian Markets Mostly Higher Amid Cautious Trades Gainers & Losers Of Mar.22: MBRX, IDRA, GEMP, XENE, VBLT...

Google Maps already tracks you; now other people can, too Associated Press | SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google Maps users will soon be able to broadcast their movements to friends and family — the latest test of how much privacy people are willing to sacrifice in an era of rampant sharing. The location-monitoring feature will begin rolling out Wednesday in an update to the Google Maps mobile app, which is already installed on most of the world's smartphones. It will also be available on personal computers. Google believes the new tool will be a more convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without having to text or call them. The Mountain View, California, company has set up the controls so individuals can decide with whom they want to share their whereabouts and for how long — anywhere from a few minutes to indefinitely. But location sharing in one of the world's most popular apps could cause friction in marriages and other relationships if one partner demands to know where the other is at all times. Similar tensions could arise if parents insist their teenagers turn on the location-sharing option before they go out. It could also be turned into a way to stalk someone entangled in an abusive relationship, warned Ruth Glenn, executive director for the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. "It has the potential to be another tool in an abuser's toolkit," she said. Similar tracking is already available on other apps; Glympse, founded by former Microsoft employees, has offered this function for years. Although it isn't as wide-ranging, Apple also offers a tracking option called "Find My Friends" on its iPhone, iPad and Watch. That's one of the reasons Google isn't expecting a lot of complaints about adding the option to Maps, especially since everyone can decide when to turn it on and who can monitor them. "We don't feel like we are changing the game," said Jen Fitzpatrick, Google's vice president of maps. Maps users will be able to activate the location-sharing feature by tapping a button near the search bar and then picking a person from their contact list to text with the information. If the recipient doesn't have the Google Maps app on their phone, it will text them a link to open the location on the map in a browser. The settings also allow users to determine how long their movements can be tracked each time a location is shared. If no time limit is selected, Google will periodically send people email reminders that they're still sharing their location, a step that Glenn said may help anyone who didn't know an abusive partner was still following them.

In the United States, Google says verified sports teams, leagues, movies and museums can now update fans, while in Brazil musicians can also get in on the act. The media rich posts can feature text, photos, videos and GIF files and also lets verified users create events on desktop and mobile. As these posts appear at the top of search results, it will allow the verified celebrities or organizations to get their message out instantly to anyone searching Google for information. Posts will appear in real time so, for example, a musician or sports team wishing to furnish fans with information on ticket availability can do so directly. Currently, users have to request access by filling in a form in order to receive verification (via TechCrunch). Google explains: “Posting on Google is a new way to share relevant, fresh content with the people who are searching for you. Use images, videos and even animated GIFs to engage your audience, and add inline links to drive traffic to specific content. This enhanced format allows searchers to hear directly from the primary source — you — and complements existing results from across the web.” Posts on Google was first introduced during the 2016 presidential election in the United States It’s not yet clear whether Google plans to expand the availability to the United Kingdom, but it’s definitely another tool that enables verified users to reach their adoring public in a prominent way. Let’s just hope Google has learned its lesson and doesn’t try to turn this into another social network. Is Posts on Google another vaualable tool in the era where fake news can steal the headlines? Share your thoughts in the comments below. 0 shares Read Comments iFrank March 22, 2017, 10:57 pm Seems reasonable but I hadn't noticed that organisations or individuals were prevented from posting info that they knew would be picked up in Google searches anyway.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today made it possible for Maps users to share their exact location with friends and family. In Maps, users need only tap the blue dot (signifying their location) and select those with whom they'd like to share. People can share through their Google contacts as well as send links through most messaging apps. The tool permits people to select how long they share their location, which ranges between 15 minutes and 3 days. Alternately, location sharing can be left on indefinitely and/or turned off at any time. Indicators in the app let people know when and with whom they are sharing their location for as long as the tool is active. Recipients of location data will see the shared location as a blue dot on Maps in addition to their own blue dot. The tool also lets people share their real-time location and trip progress while navigating between points. Google says the location-sharing feature works on Android, iPhone, the mobile web, and desktops. Google plans to roll the tool out worldwide over the next few days. Google also recently made it easier for people to remember where they parked their car. A tool in Maps lets users pinpoint their parking spot when they park. more info at Google » Related Google news Android news iOS news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google updated a handful of its apps and services today, including Duo, Allo, and Photos. Moving forward, Duo users on Android and iOS will be able to make voice-only calls when they wish. Google says Duo's voice calls work well on most connection speeds and won't consume much data. Audio calls via Duo are being made available in Brazil today, with other regions to follow in the next few days. Google updated its Allo messaging app with support for attachments in group chats. Users will be able to share several file types (.pdf, .docs, .apk, .zip, and mp3) with groups through the messaging app. Last, Google says Photos is now better at backing up photos. Photos will first send low-resolution backups to Photos when the network connection is slow or spotty. Photos will then replace the low-resolution shots with high-quality images once good connectivity is available. Moreover, people will be able to share the low-resolution previews with others immediately. These new features are rolling out to Duo, Allo, and Photos over the next few days. more info at Google » Related Google news Android news iOS news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

MST March 22, 2017 LAS VEGAS, NV - JANUARY 05: A Google logo is shown on a screen during a keynote address by CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Group Richard Yu at CES 2017 at The Venetian Las Vegas on January 5, 2017 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo: Ethan Miller/Getty Images, 2017 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — AT&T says it's pulling its business from Google and YouTube despite the Internet giant's pledge this week to keep offensive and extremist content away from ads. "We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate," the company said in an emailed statement. "Until Google can ensure this won’t happen again, we are removing our ads from Google’s non-search platforms." Google declined to comment. The decision by a major U.S. brand to yank its ads suggests that an advertiser boycott that began in the U.K. is now spreading. That, despite assurances this week from Google that it would pull online ads from controversial content, give brands more control over where their ads appear and would deploy more people to enforce its ad policies. Google's attempt to quell a growing boycott by the British government and major brands in the U.K. angered over the placement of online ads alongside offensive or extremist content — such as videos by white supremacists —  did not go far enough, according to Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser, who downgraded Google parent company Alphabet's stock on Monday. He had warned the U.K. boycott could have global repercussions for Google. Wieser says Google must adopt a zero tolerance policy for putting brands in "unsafe environments when they place ads." With the changes announced late Monday, advertisers on YouTube and on Google's advertising system that places ads across the web will be able to exclude websites and videos that are "potentially objectionable," will have greater latitude to decide where they want their ads to appear and will have more "visibility" on where their ads are running. "We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values," Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, wrote in a blog post about the changes. "So starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content." Why is this such a significant issue? "Brand safety" has emerged as possibly the biggest issue facing the advertising industry, Wieser says. For large marketers, even one ad placed next to extremist content can cause harm to a brand, he said. Google reviews content flagged by users. Four hundred hours of video is uploaded every minute to YouTube, Google says, making it tough to police. Some 98% of content flagged on YouTube is reviewed within 24 hours, Google says. © 2017 USATODAY.COM CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Livestream 4 Giraffe Birth Facts Anti-Trump billboard artist gets death threats Deadly fake oxy pills being sold in Arizona Child shot and killed - what happened?

Apostle Suleman’s Sex Scandal, Buhari’s return, #InternationalWomensDay top Google Searches 22.03.2017 at 8:02 pm By BellaNaija.com Leave a Comment Google said on Wednesday that achievements, contributions and a scandal involving women, topped the list of internet searches last week. Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, Google’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager for Anglophone West Africa made the announcement in Lagos. According to him, the development shows that women are steadily coming worldwide. He said that the searches which ended on March 15 saw the internet filled with excitement as people went online to search for the International Women’s Day. The International Women’s Day, which was on March 8, was another reason to celebrate the contributions of women all over the world and Nigeria was not left out. The earliest women’s day observance was held on February 28, 1909 in New York and organised by the Socialist Party of America. It was really nice to see that Nigerians observed this celebration and Nigerian women were also celebrated. The Google manager said that the return of President also got people’s attention online. “”Yes, so President Buhari finally leaves London and returns to Nigeria. Hopes were rekindled and faces lifted again as the President of Nigeria returned from his London vacation and routine medical check-up. After being away for 51 days, President Buhari is finally back at Aso Villa and rededicated to serving Nigeria and Nigerians,” the Google spokesman said. The Stephanie Otobo, Canada-based singer vs Apostle Johnson Suleman, the General Overseer of Omega Fire Ministries (OFM) Worldwide saga also got attention online. Suleiman raised an outcry of a plot by Festus Keyamo, a legal practitioner, and his alleged paymasters, to unveil a cloned video clip to prove that he had an ardent relationship with Otobo. Nollywood actress Daniella Okeke also disclaimed involvement with the Suleman sex scandal. Daniella said she had been directed by her lawyers to keep mute and it would be the responsibility of her lawyers to respond on her behalf. Nollywood actress Mercy Johnson’s appointment as the Senior Special Assistant on Entertainment, Arts, and Culture by Yahaya Bello of Kogi also got attention online.

The location-monitoring feature will begin rolling out today in an update to the Google Maps mobile app, which is already installed on most of the world's smartphones. It will also be available on personal computers. Google believes the new tool will be a more convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without having to text or call them. The Mountain View, California, company has set up the controls so individuals can decide with whom they want to share their whereabouts and for how long anywhere from a few minutes to indefinitely. But location sharing in one of the world's most popular apps could cause friction in marriages and other relationships if one partner demands to know where the other is at all times. Similar tensions could arise if parents insist their teenagers turn on the location-sharing option before they go out. It could also be turned into a way to stalk someone entangled in an abusive relationship, warned Ruth Glenn, executive director for the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. "It has the potential to be another tool in an abuser's toolkit," she said. Similar tracking is already available on other apps; Glympse, founded by former Microsoft employees, has offered this function for years. Although it isn't as wide-ranging, Apple also offers a tracking option called "Find My Friends" on its iPhone, iPad and Watch. That's one of the reasons Google isn't expecting a lot of complaints about adding the option to Maps, especially since everyone can decide when to turn it on and who can monitor them. "We don't feel like we are changing the game," said Jen Fitzpatrick, Google's vice president of maps. Maps users will be able to activate the location-sharing feature by tapping a button near the search bar and then picking a person from their contact list to text with the information. If the recipient doesn't have the Google Maps app on their phone, it will text them a link to open the location on the map in a browser.

Google Duo — initially released last August as a mobile app for video chatting — will also offer audio-only calls on Android and iOS. The new feature is now available in Brazil and will be arriving “around the world in the coming days,” according to Google. (Of course, you can also make video and audio calls on a range of other Google platforms, including Hangouts and Voice, which recently received a long-awaited upgrade.) For those with extensive document-sharing needs, Google’s mobile messaging app Allo now allows Android users to share a variety of files (.pdf, .docs, .apk, .zip, and .mp3) with their contacts. Unlike the rollout of the Duo calling feature, the update to Allo is available today worldwide. To prevent that inevitable frustration when trying to back up or share pictures with a spotty internet connection, Google Photos boasts two new features for Android and iOS that allow for easier backup and sharing on low connectivity. Photos will be automatically backed up “in a lightweight preview quality” on slow connections then replaced with higher-quality images when a faster Wi-Fi connection becomes available. A similar dynamic applies to sharing: you can first send photos and videos in low resolution for immediate viewing, and the pictures will eventually be updated in higher resolution once a better connection is found. Per the press release, “never mind if you're at the beach or hiking in the mountains,” you can still share photos instantly. For the less fortunate among us, this will probably come in handy when we’re stuck on a crowded subway underground. Today’s announcements came alongside the news that Google Maps will soon allow users to share their real-time location with friends and family for up to three days.

That was a decent night’s work for England, despite the scoreline. They lost to a screamer from the retiring Lukas Podolski but played some sophisticated football and were the better team for plenty of the game. The 3-4-2-1 system worked well, and Alli and Lallana were outstanding in everything apart from their finishing. Thanks for your company; goodnight.

There is so much to like about him - Ryan Giggs just came out with a nice line on ITV about Lallana “setting traps” before nicking the ball high up the pitch - but he’s not a killer. I do think he’s becoming more efficient under Jurgen Klopp though, and I’d always have him in the England team.

And Jogi Löw has taken this to a whole new level, handing out debuts like vaccinations and having already said that he will be using the Confed Cup to “experiment”. And let’s face it – this is not even a friendly, this is a vehicle for Podolski, who’d never even play under different circumstances.” Oh it’s okay, having an open-top-bus parade for winning a friendly is so 2016.

Germany lost the ball in their own third, with Bertrand and Vardy working the ball quickly from left to right to give Alli a clear shooting chance.

CBS News March 22, 2017, 2:05 PM "How Google Works" authors on Alphabet and Trump administration Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Google has grown dramatically in the last decade, with revenue soaring to $90 billion in 2016. The company’s growth led to concerns among some staff about how it functions, so its leaders restructured under a parent company called Alphabet to encourage more innovation and so-called moonshot projects. Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt and fellow executive Jonathan Rosenberg, who helped build the tech giant, have updated their bestselling book, “How Google Works,” with a chapter on “How Alphabet Works.” “When you take a company that triples in size… ultimately you have to organize differently,” Schmidt said Wednesday on “CBS This Morning. “So you have to organize around the people who have the biggest impact. So what we did is we took those people and put them in charge of companies.” Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin can tackle more ambitious ventures and have multiple CEOs to scale the projects around, including current Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Jonathan Rosenberg (left) and Eric Schmidt. “The two founders will actually spend a whole day with a particular technical team trying to tease out not just the technical insights but also the business opportunities,” Schmidt said. For example, Schmidt said he thinks Alphabet’s driverless cars will be out on the streets within the next year or two. But Schmidt thinks American technological innovations could be hampered by the Trump administration, particularly with the president’s proposed budget cuts in science and medical research. Schmidt calls that a “mistake,” a view he believes is probably shared by the industry as a whole. “The reason is that there are roles of the government that are difficult to have technology or companies replace. The internet itself came out of a DARPA grant, part of the military programs. There are so many things that we use every day that have come out of funding. Medical funding is also being proposed to be cut. Those cuts should be restored,” Schmidt said. Mr. Trump’s travel ban — currently on hold — would also greatly impact the tech industry, as 37 percent of Silicon Valley workers are foreign born. As part of comprehensive immigration reform, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer also has said the Trump administration will be reviewing work visas, which would include the H-1B visa. Are U.S. jobs vulnerable to workers with H-1B visas? “The industry is completely united on diversity and inclusion, and the importance of high skills immigration,” Schmidt said.  Play Video CBS Evening News Why tech companies oppose travel ban Some of the biggest names in technology have come out against President Trump's travel ban, including Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. John... “It is insane to allow people to stay in other countries who want to come to our country to create companies, and to create new jobs, create wealth, and power our economy.

"We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate," AT&T said in a statement provided to CNBC. "Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms." The suspension affects YouTube and Google's display network, according to The Wall Street Journal, which previously reported the news. Getty Images Google CEO Sundar Pichai Verizon also told CNBC it pulled some ads from the platform after learning that they were appearing on "non-sanctioned" websites. Verizon said it wanted to make sure its brand was not negatively impacted and was investigating the "weak links" with advertising partners. Verizon said it's also pulling ads from other digital non-search properties, not just those owned by Google. The telecom companies join other companies that have stepped back from Google, after an investigation from The Times of London found that ads for Mercedes-Benz and Marie Curie were running next to jihadist and neo-Nazi content. Google apologized and revamped its ad policy on Tuesday, especially on YouTube. Google said it will start "removing ads more effectively from content that is attacking or harassing people," and will change the default safety setting for ads. Google said on Wednesday that it couldn't comment on AT&T, citing a policy against commenting on individual customers. But the company said it is raising the bar for its ads to safeguard brands. "[A]s announced, we've begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear," a Google spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. Google makes most of its money from advertisements and is one of the top online ad providers in the world. The problem of offensive content also plagues Google's competitors — especially when it comes to video, advertising professionals told CNBC. — CNBC's Michelle Castillo contributed to this report Anita BalakrishnanNews Associate Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change T --- GOOGL --- Binge 'Walking Dead' a megahit, thanks in part to white-knuckled binge-watchers By: Marc Gilbert, senior producer, CNBC Walking Dead producer: The phenomenon is no accident    Walking Dead producer: The show isn’t about zombies    Terminator writer sounds alarm on AI    Walking Dead producer: VR makes me nauseous

Name: Subject: Message: Google Allo, Duo, Photos, and Search all receiving new updates today Newsby David Imel19 hours ago 2 322 18 It’s been a huge week for Google. Just yesterday the company announced the developer preview for Android O, the newest version of its mobile operating system, and we’ve been hard at work digging through its contents to give you everything we’ve got to offer on the subject. Today, Google decided to keep the ball rolling in Brazil, where it announced a number of updates for Allo, Duo, and Photos. These are all pretty minor changes, so we’ve decided to keep it all to one post. Let us know if you see anything we missed. Google Allo With the new update for Google Allo, users can finally share documents and files like .pdf, .doc, .zip, .apk, and .mp3. This makes it easier for those using the app to use it as their one-stop-shop for messaging (assuming you know people who use it), as you can now perform searches, share images, and more all in one place. In addition, users in Brazil will finally get Smart Smiley in Portuguese, which will suggest relevant emoji, stickers, and more as you’re in the process of typing out your message. This was previously only available on the English side of things when it was first announced last November, so it’s good to see more languages finally getting support. Download Google Allo from the Play Store Google Duo If you’re one of the few users still using Duo (they exist… I think?), you’re in for an interesting treat today as well. Now, you’ll be able to use the app in Audio-only mode, essentially turning the app into a VoIP. While this arguably removes the whole key feature of Duo called “Knock”, it can be useful for those that are in areas with poor cellular connections but do not have enough data to do a video call. This call still takes place over the internet of course, but Google is promising that this voice-only mode will work well on all connection speeds and will use up only small amounts of data. The update will be rolling out to users in Brazil first, and will make its way to other countries “in the coming days.” Download Google Duo from the Play Store Google Photos Both the iOS and Android versions of Google Photos have been updated with low-connectivity backup. This is useful for if you need to share an image regardless of quality, as it can now upload a “lightweight preview quality” image even on 2G connection, then back up and replace these images with high resolution versions once your device connects to Wi-Fi. You can send these images to anyone you want as soon as the lightweight version is uploaded, so you’ll be able to send visual directions, landmarks, and more to your friends and family even when service is spotty. Look for the update today. Download Google Photos from the Play Store Google Search When you search for a person, place, or thing, you’ll often get quick highlighted results showing you the answer to your exact question. But what if you want to see more content related to that noun? Usually, you would have to go on a relevant social network like Twitter or Google+ and search that term to find relevant gifs, shows, and more, but now Google is letting you do all of this within the app. Currently, Google is supporting museums, sports teams, sports leagues, and movies (in Brazil only), but we’re sure they will opt to expand this feature to more content in the near future. Download Google Search from the Play Store While most of these updates seem pretty darn minor in their own right, it’s good to see the company addressing issues that it thinks are relevant to “mobile-first” countries, where smartphones are one of the primary uses of communication.

Google allows users to share their locations in mapping app Technology Wednesday 22 March 2017 - 7:41pm This picture taken on May 13, 2013 in the French western city of Rennes shows a woman choosing Google Search (or Google Web Search) web search engine front page on her tablet. A report by a French expert panel published on May 13, 2013 recommended imposin Photo: AFP/Damien Meyer NEW YORK - Alphabet Inc's Google announced on Wednesday that it will revamp its popular maps app to allow users to share their locations, in order to boost engagement on a product of increasing strategic importance to the search giant. Within the next week, users worldwide will be able to share where they are in real time on devices running both Google’s Android operating system and Apple Inc’s iOS software, Google said. The feature is part of an array of new tools aimed at boosting the effectiveness of Google Maps, which analysts say is critical to the company’s ambitions in commerce and transport. READ: Google sorry for adverts alongside extremist content The location-sharing feature is aimed at helping people find each other in crowded places, such as concerts and conferences, and users will retain control over who they share their whereabouts with and for how long, said Google executive Jen Fitzpatrick, who leads Google Maps. “That coordination in that sort of last-mile moment winds up being sometimes more complicated than you might think,” she told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday. Location-sharing features have sparked alarm among privacy advocates in the past. To address those concerns, Google will remind users both in the app and via email of whom they are sharing their location with. While the recipient of a user’s location could pass that link onto a third party, Google will advise people to use the feature only with those they trust, said Ben Greenwood, a product manager for Google Maps. “This is not a new concept,” Fitzpatrick said of location-sharing. “This is about making it simple, accessible and giving users a lot of control and privacy.” READ: Hacked websites on the rise: Google In the coming weeks, Google will also roll out mapping features aimed at helping users find parking and remember where they parked their cars, Fitzpatrick said. Ride-hailing services have also become an important aspect of the app, and Google Maps will have partnerships with 14 companies in 70 countries by the end of the week, she said. Mapping has become a key contributor to Google’s advertising juggernaut, said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research, and the tech giant cannot afford to let the app languish. “It’s an absolutely essential service for them to drive more growth in all of their key revenue-generating businesses,” he said.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Android / Google is working with smartphone makers to fix slow Android updates Google is working with smartphone makers to fix slow Android updates Matthew Wilson 20 hours ago Android, Featured Tech News, Tech News After years of smartphone manufacturers being left to take their time when it comes to rolling out important Android security updates, Google is finally planning on taking charge. This week, Android O was announced and rather than leaving smartphone manufacturers to figure things out on their own, Google is planning on working closely with the likes of Samsung, HTC, Motorola and more to ensure swifter updates. Speaking with TechCrunch this week, Google mentioned that it has begun working closely with manufacturers and has managed to get wait times for security updates down from nine weeks to just a matter of days. This means that going forward, you won’t be left vulnerable for several months while those with Pixel or Nexus smartphones are perfectly safe. Google added that it will also begin sharing its data on update speed for its own devices with carriers and phone makers as it provides more visibility. This is all information that was previously unavailable, so manufacturers knew update rates for low but thought someone else was to blame. Providing this additional information means smartphone makers aren’t caught off guard when Google issues a new update and they can get the ball rolling faster. KitGuru Says: Unfortunately, these faster updates only apply to security patches but hopefully this closer relationship with Google will also lead to faster Android upgrades too as right now, many flagship device owners are often left waiting months for the next version of Android.

I know this will never happen as carriers fear Android pushing an update that breaks something and causes a tech support nightmare but until it happens the general public are wandering around in blissful ignorance unaware how vulnerable they are. When the inevitable day comes you can guarantee it’ll all be Androids fault. WhateverYouWantItToBe Android updates seem to be about the only reason to upgrade anymore. Phones aren’t improving as much as they were a few years ago and performance is great on most phones. The only reason I’ve thought about upgrading from my Moto X Style is for snappier Android updates. Still waiting for 7.0 makes me frustrated. WhateverYouWantItToBe no Matt Booth There are so many moving parts when it comes to OEM updates it’s going to be impossible to achieve what most users want. I’d say, hands down, every user wants to have the latest OS on their phone. It’s all well and good Google talking about these things, but hardly anyone gets to use it. Any phone that is physically capable of running an OS update should get it. The problem is chipset makers like Qualcomm throw the towel in on chipsets very quickly. SoC manufacturers want to make sure they can move their latest tech, so they stop supporting updates on older SoCs. I think, and I bet most agree with me, that in this case their should be asked to open source the binaries so that OEM’s can still build the latest OS for older phones. Perhaps an agreement that OEM’s will move on to the newer SoC’s or SoCs will only be available for so long etc etc. Something needs to be done, though. It’s unlikely the Nexus 6 (shamu)will get Android O. It barely got Android N, but it’s more than capable of it. Either open source the software to allow OEM’s to build, or the community. One way or another. Polls Which CPU air cooler next? Antec Arctic be quiet! Cooler Master Noctua Phanteks Thermaltake Sorry - Liquid only View Results  Loading ...

Google said it'll help people meet at social events and indicate when you're running late. Google announced the feature in a blog post today. The update is rolling out now to iOS and Android devices. Location sharing is activated using a new setting in the Google Maps hamburger menu, labelled "Share location." You can also turn it on by tapping on the blue dot marking your location on the map. You can choose which friends to display your location to and specify how long the location sharing should be active. Once you confirm the options, your selected friends will see you on their map within the app. Your location will remain visible until you either turn off sharing or the timer expires. A special icon displayed on your own map indicates whether friends are currently able to track your location. Location sharing isn't limited to your direct friends and family stored in your Google contacts. It’s also possible to generate a public link which anyone can use to view your location. This could be given out to co-workers and representatives from other companies when you need to meet up in person. The link can be shared directly using messaging apps. Google suggested the feature will be useful if you're running late for a social event or business trip and want others to see where you've got to. Alternatively, it could allow you to navigate a friend towards your location if they're lost in an unfamiliar area. If you're using guided navigation, you can share your route with your contacts so they can see your estimated arrival time and progress. While it could be useful at times, location sharing still remains a controversial feature which isn't always popular with users. Google has sought to allay concerns that friends could stalk your progress by making it obvious when location sharing is turned on. However, concerns about the consequences of accidentally enabling the feature or the location data being intercepted by a third-party remain serious considerations. The problems associated with location sharing have already seen one major player reverse its stance on the feature. In December, Facebook decided to stop showing the precise location of users in its Nearby Friends feature. Instead, the app now gives a broader overview of where you are, marking the neighbourhood and region rather than a street-level map. Google commented on the sensitivity of location sharing, telling TechCrunch it's focused on "making things simple, accessible and giving people that access to transparency." The company acknowledged that not everyone is comfortable with the idea of apps being able to monitor their position, announcing it has an internal public policy team to oversee the implementation of location sharing across its apps. The feature is available worldwide in Maps from today.

The Mountain View giant announced the new feature is going live in Brazil first before it can make its way to other parts of the world in the coming days.  On Wednesday, Google VP for Product Management Mario Queiroz wrote on Google’s The Keyword blog that the barely 1-year-old Duo is getting an audio-only calling feature. The decision to introduce the common phone feature was propelled by Google’s intention of catering to users who may not have access to stable network connection to do video calling. Queiroz noted that because the audio calling feature does not eat up data, it will work well on any type of connection speed and will also help users remain connected with their family and friends even when video calling isn’t possible.  Brazil will be the first country to have access to the audio calling feature of Duo. Google recognized that though Brazil is home to heavy users of its products like YouTube, Search and Maps, there is still a lot of work to be done in the country to make technology readily available to everyone there. Thus, the tech giant is starting its rollout of the audio-only calling feature there prior to bringing it to the world.  Duo was launched in August 2016 months after its announcement at the Google I/O in May 2016. Just less than a week since it was released, the app quickly crawled to the top of the Google Play Store’s Top Free section, as per Phone Arena. As of writing, the app has been downloaded for around 10 million to 50 million times as indicated on the Google Play Store.  Shortly after its release, Google product lead Amit Fulay said that an audio calling feature is coming to the app soon. Nearly seven months later, the feature is now being rolled out to consumers albeit slowly. The gap between Fulay’s statement and the release of the feature is said to indicate that audio calling wasn’t one of the top priorities of the company, as pointed out by TechLone.  Google Duo will be updated with an audio-calling feature in the coming days.

Two that fall in the “newest” category that are receiving updates are Allo and Duo, the communications tandem that was first announced at Google I/O in 2016.  Allo will see an update that includes the ability to send files to other users. The update (or availability of the feature) should start arriving on handsets across the globe where Allo is available. You’ll find the option in a conversation by tapping the “+” in the chat box, then selecting the paperclip icon. The types of files OK’d to send are .pdf, .docs, .apk(!), .zip, and .mp3. As for Duo, Google is adding audio calling to the video chatting app, though it’ll only be available in Brazil to start. The rest of the world should get it within the “coming days.” As you can imagine, audio calling means calling without video and probably should have been there from day 1. Either way, it’s here now!

Home Technology Google Maps already tracks you; now other people can, too Google Maps already tracks you; now other people can, too Google believes the new tool will be a more convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without having to text or call them. By: Associated Press | San Francisco | Updated: March 22, 2017 11:14 PM Google Maps already tracks you; now other people can, too. (Reuters) Google Maps users will soon be able to broadcast their movements to friends and family the latest test of how much privacy people are willing to sacrifice in an era of rampant sharing. The location-monitoring feature will begin rolling out today in an update to the Google Maps mobile app, which is already installed on most of the world’s smartphones. It will also be available on personal computers. Google believes the new tool will be a more convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without having to text or call them. The Mountain View, California, company has set up the controls so individuals can decide with whom they want to share their whereabouts and for how long anywhere from a few minutes to indefinitely. But location sharing in one of the world’s most popular apps could cause friction in marriages and other relationships if one partner demands to know where the other is at all times. Similar tensions could arise if parents insist their teenagers turn on the location-sharing option before they go out. Also watch: It could also be turned into a way to stalk someone entangled in an abusive relationship, warned Ruth Glenn, executive director for the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. “It has the potential to be another tool in an abuser’s toolkit,” she said. Similar tracking is already available on other apps; Glympse, founded by former Microsoft employees, has offered this function for years. Although it isn’t as wide-ranging, Apple also offers a tracking option called “Find My Friends” on its iPhone, iPad and Watch. That’s one of the reasons Google isn’t expecting a lot of complaints about adding the option to Maps, especially since everyone can decide when to turn it on and who can monitor them. “We don’t feel like we are changing the game,” said Jen Fitzpatrick, Google’s vice president of maps. Maps users will be able to activate the location-sharing feature by tapping a button near the search bar and then picking a person from their contact list to text with the information. If the recipient doesn’t have the Google Maps app on their phone, it will text them a link to open the location on the map in a browser. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Picture: EWN Google Advertising Email Print Tweet Share Kevin Brandt | 20 hours ago CAPE TOWN - Search engine Google has issued an apology to major advertisers for showcasing their ads alongside content from hate preachers and extremist groups. CNN reports several major companies and advertising agencies have pulled their advertisements from Google and YouTube in recent days. Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google have now set up a joint data-base to track and remove terrorist content. CNN’s Samuel Burke reported that: “Any social network, if they see a picture or a video that they deem to be terrorist content or extremist content, all they have to do is to label it once and automatically the other social media companies that are participating in this will see that and can bring down this content automatically. So, the second it is tried or attempted to be published, it will come down before anyone sees it. It is something that they should have done many years ago.” Timeline Google unveils its ‘nightmare-inducing’ robot 2 hours ago Online advertisers sign up to better standards one day ago Google translate is now able to translate even more languages, thanks to AI 11 days ago Coca-Cola serves up gay-friendly ad 16 days ago More in World Sunken South Korean ferry emerges 3 years after disaster 22 minutes ago US embassies ordered to ID population groups for tougher visa screening 53 minutes ago London attacker British-born, had been investigated for extremism one hour ago Police make eighth arrest after London attack 2 hours ago Saboteurs blew up arms warehouse - Ukraine military 4 hours ago Terror-hit UK mulls limiting public access to parliament 4 hours ago Comments EWN welcomes all comments that are constructive, contribute to discussions in a meaningful manner and take stories forward.

LGBT? Oh, no, that's sensitive Personal Tech With Skype, Microsoft's messaging strategy looks coherent at last (almost) It'll probably change next week 22 Mar 2017 at 17:05, Andrew Orlowski Analysis In 2015 we compared, after many years' experience, Microsoft strategy to "a heavily armed octopus trying to shoot itself in the head". But relatively speaking, there's one product category where its hard work is beginning to appear coherent – at least compared to the competition. After a year in beta and several false starts, Skype for Windows 10 emerged from beta this week. Version 11.13.115.0 of the UWP app – which runs on Windows 10, Xbox, the HoloLens nerd goggles, and mobile – now does SMS messages. Being clunky old Microsoft, it does so in two ways – only one of which provides a return path for replies. But it finally unites the product formerly known as Lync – now Skype for Business – in one product after two years. Lync was an unexpected success for Microsoft, but fell victim to the strategy battles at Microsoft which pulled the product first one way and then another. At one stage Skype had three strategy shifts within a nine month period. If Microsoft for once looks coherent, it's because its business rivals have been chaotic. Google, which is perennially obsessed with Facebook, has flung new messaging clients at the market – some of which do voice, some of which don't – leaving their predecessors to wither from bitrot. Once upon a time Google had Voice, Buzz and Talk. People liked Talk, which played nicely with XMPP, so that had to be deprecated. Then it introduced Hangouts, the purpose of which was to lure people into the Google+ social network. People liked Hangouts, but that didn't matter either. Along came Google Spaces, a sharing app in which you chatted, Google Allo, a chat app in which you can talk to a robot, and Google Duo, a very simple video calling app, similar to the original Skype. Is that all? Of course not. Last year Google bought Jibe, which does telco-approved OTT messaging, with the intention of turning its Android Messages app into an RCS client. RCS is the protocol suite big mobile operators developed years ago in a futile bid to fend off OTT messaging clients like WhatsApp. The move was unexpected. And now apparently Hangouts is split into two: Chat (group conferencing), and Meet (a Slack-a-like). Confused? You should be, as it even confuses Google's staff. Shortly after posting this explanation of Google's messaging strategy... Google's messaging strategy, simplified. pic.twitter.com/23UPXabQ6c — Brenden Mulligan (@mulligan) March 9, 2017 ... product manager Brenden Mulligan had to add a clarification: Should have put multi-platform messaging strategy. This leaves out Android Messenger, which is obviously Android only. https://t.co/i3hTwDRzfn — Brenden Mulligan (@mulligan) March 10, 2017 How Microsoft has managed to keep Skype on the same course for more than a few weeks is down to two things. Ignoring what Facebook and Google are doing – wisely, as these are Snap-obsessed consumer plays. And by spurning the opportunity to use Skype's installed base to take on Slack. Instead, Microsoft's Slack-competitor Teams is another Office product. Phew. Microsoft still has its legacy products too: Yammer and GroupMe – products that hark back to years of a wild uncoordinated M&A spree – still take new signups.

Augmented reality the next big thing in VR (graph) Mar, 22 2017 Author: newsroom Tech giants already working on devices Related 360-degree travel videos open new path to travel industry 2016 was the year that virtual reality (VR) was successfully introduced to the consumer market. But industry giants Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook are already working towards creating augmented reality devices that some are touting as the “next big thing”. With Sony, Facebook, Google and others all having released virtual reality headsets and an estimated 10 million units shipped in 2016, the technology clearly has a head start over augmented reality. And, according to a recent forecast published by IDC, AR headsets won’t be competing with VR devices in terms of unit sales anytime soon. The company’s analysts do however expect augmented reality headsets to become the much bigger market in terms of revenue. According to their estimates, the augmented reality market could reach nearly $50 billion a year by 2021, which would explain why every major player wants in on the party. Because of the more sophisticated technology involved, future augmented reality devices are expected to be priced significantly higher than virtual reality headsets which, depending on the level of sophistication, can be bought for less than $100. According to IDC’s senior research analyst Jitesh Ubrani, such low-cost models may ultimately hurt VR technology more than they promote it. He argues that consumers who have a bad experience using an entry-level model may turn their backs on the tech altogether. source: statista Tags With: appleaugmentedfacebookgooglemicrosoftreality ← Crete 6th best destination worldwide: TripAdvisor This is the terrorist of the London attacks (photos) → Mar, 23 2017 ISIS: London attacker was our soldier Mar, 23 2017 Rex Tillerson on being the US Secretary of State: ‘I… Mar, 23 2017 A compilation of the most shocking fighter jets low flyover… Recent Popular TOP-10 Italian Women Celebrities!

The location-monitoring feature will begin rolling out today in an update to the Google Maps mobile app, which is already installed on most of the world's smartphones. It will also be available on personal computers. Google believes the new tool will be a more convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without having to text or call them. The Mountain View, California, company has set up the controls so individuals can decide with whom they want to share their whereabouts and for how long anywhere from a few minutes to indefinitely. But location sharing in one of the world's most popular apps could cause friction in marriages and other relationships if one partner demands to know where the other is at all times. Similar tensions could arise if parents insist their teenagers turn on the location-sharing option before they go out. It could also be turned into a way to stalk someone entangled in an abusive relationship, warned Ruth Glenn, executive director for the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. "It has the potential to be another tool in an abuser's toolkit," she said. Similar tracking is already available on other apps; Glympse, founded by former Microsoft employees, has offered this function for years. Although it isn't as wide-ranging, Apple also offers a tracking option called "Find My Friends" on its iPhone, iPad and Watch. That's one of the reasons Google isn't expecting a lot of complaints about adding the option to Maps, especially since everyone can decide when to turn it on and who can monitor them. "We don't feel like we are changing the game," said Jen Fitzpatrick, Google's vice president of maps. Maps users will be able to activate the location-sharing feature by tapping a button near the search bar and then picking a person from their contact list to text with the information. If the recipient doesn't have the Google Maps app on their phone, it will text them a link to open the location on the map in a browser.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Google Affiliate Offers Tools To Safeguard Elections By Anick Jesdanun PUBLISHED: MARCH 22 2017 An organization affiliated with Google is offering tools that news organizations and election-related sites can use to protect themselves from hacking. Jigsaw, a research arm of Google parent company Alphabet Inc., says that free and fair elections depend on access to information. To ensure such access, Jigsaw says, sites for news, human rights and election monitoring need to be protected from cyberattacks. Jigsaw's suite of tools, called Protect Your Election, is mostly a repackaging of existing tools: -- Project Shield will help websites guard against denial-of-service attacks, in which hackers flood sites with so much traffic that legitimate visitors can't get through. Users of Project Shield will be tapping technology and servers that Google already uses to protect its own sites from such attacks. -- Password Alert is software that people can add to Chrome browsers to warn them when they try to enter their Google password on another site, often a sign of a phishing attempt. -- 2-Step Verification helps beef up security beyond passwords by requiring a second access code, such as a text sent to a verified cellphone. Though Jigsaw directs users to turn this on for Google accounts, most major rivals offer similar protections, too. "This is as much an occasion to have a conversation about digital security as it is putting all the tools in one place," Jigsaw spokesman Dan Keyserling said. While the tools can be useful to a variety of groups and individuals, Jigsaw says it is focusing on elections because cyberattacks often increase against news organizations and election information sites around election time. In particular, Jigsaw wants to help sites deploy the tools ahead of the French presidential elections, which begin April 23. The tools are free, though Project Shield is limited to news organizations, individual journalists, human-rights groups and election-monitoring organizations. It's not known whether the tools might have prevented some of the high-profile attacks in the past, including the theft of emails from Democratic Party computers during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The tools do not directly address such break-ins, but they could help guard against password stealing, a common precursor to break-ins. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Microsoft Slack Competitor Launches Next Article > Google Debuts Family Link Parental Control Software PUBLISHED: MARCH 16 2017 Alphabet Inc. has a new a feature that will help in navigating around child safety features on gadgets. The tech giant will be launching the Family Link, an app that will give parents full parental controls over their children’s devices. Parents will easily establish their child’s first Google account and the series of parental controls will give them power over screen time. Apparently, Apple and Amazon.com, Inc. offer parental controls on their devices. However, differ from Family Link because Family Link is a two-party system. This makes it more of a monitoring software. Family Link requires that both parent and child use Android. Basic parental controls are easy to spot on the standard versions of Apple Inc. iOS and Google Android. However, they are not as extensive as those being offered by Family Link. Google says that it is seeking to keep parents calm over their children’s safety while they use the internet. Nonetheless, the two must be using Android devices whereby the parent first downloads the app to their device. They also must have Android KitKat (4.4) or higher. Thereafter they can set up the child’s Google account. On the other hand, the child’s device must be running either Android Nougat (7.0) or Marshmallow (6.1) and after the parent signs into theirs, it becomes easy to track usage. But many of today’s parental control systems are lacking guidance. Many of the present parental control systems lack guidance yet all have positive app ratings. While Family Link may not be the best solution, parents will be allowed to configure remotely some of the shifting alternatives for some of Google’s own apps. That means kids will not have access to adult content or any other inappropriate material. The presence of the standalone application could also be very helpful to parents. Nonetheless, Google says it is only accessible to testers willing to try it out at its early preview. In the meantime, Alphabet’s stock was trading at $868.39 witnessing an increase of $2.48 or 0.29%. © 2017 Market Exclusive under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Maps will soon roll out location sharing features worldwide Newsby John Callaham20 hours ago 3 409 12 It’s been one of the most requested features for Google Maps users, and it’s finally coming in the near future. The company revealed today that an update will soon be rolling out worldwide for both the Android and iOS versions of Google Maps that will add a way for people to share their current location with their friends, or anyone else. See also: How to use your Google Maps offline 2 days ago Google says that the update will let people share their location in the Google Maps app by either accessing its side menu or by just tapping on the blue dot in the map, which is supposed to show where you are currently located. Then you tap on the “Share location” option, and finally you select which of your family, friends or other contacts you want to inform where you are, and how long you want to share that location info. The people you pick will then get a notification via a messenger app and they can then see see your location on their own Google Maps app, or if they are on a PC they will see you on the Google Maps website. In addition to location sharing, the upcoming Google Maps update will also let users who are on the go share their current trip progress with anyone else via the app’s navigation screen. They just need to tap on the More button on the bottom of the screen, and then tap Share trip. Anyone that you have selected to get that information will be able to see your current progress on their Google Maps app, along with an estimated time for when you are supposed to arrive at your destination. This is obviously a huge new feature, and one which has been highly anticipated for some time. Google doesn’t say when this update will be rolled out, other than “soon”, so it may take a few days for Google Maps to add these new features on your phone.

Listen to March Madness on Google Home You should be able to listen to March Madness on Google Home, but it can be maddening to get this started. You’ll need to add TuneIn Radio to your Google Home and install the app on your phone. From there you can say, “OK Google, listen to NCAA March Madness on Westwood One Sports.” Depending on the game you want to listen to, you may need to add a B, C, D or E to the end of that command. Check in the app to see what station your favorite team is on. When is the Next March Madness Game? It’s easy to lose track of what day and when the next March Madness game takes place. You can ask Google Home, “Ok Google, when is the next March Madness game?” and the assistant will run down a list of upcoming games.

If you value your security, and most of you probably do, you'll want to think about installing the Galaxy S7 Nougat update soon after it arrives for your device.  Every month, Google and Samsung release important security patches for Android devices. The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Android Nougat updates should bring the latest security patches to your device. Samsung's initial batch of Galaxy S7 Nougat updates delivered the company's January security update while upcoming updates could deliver the patches from the February security update. You can read more about their contents on Samsung's website.  If you failed to download or receive an older security update (December, November, etc), the patches from those updates might be baked into your version of Nougat. If not, you might be forced to install them manually before you can download Nougat.  On top of the patches, Samsung's Galaxy S7 Nougat update brings Samsung Pass, a way to secure your identity using biometric data rather than entering your password or ID.  Samsung Pass is like a master key for your various logins and it relies on Galaxy S7's fingerprint scanner. The biometric data is encrypted and stored safely by Samsung Knox.   1 / 9 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Can Google get users on board with “shortcuts in search”? Mobile PPC SEO 22 Mar 17 | Clark Boyd Facebook0 Linkedin41 Google+2 Twitter 43 Google announced yesterday the launch of “shortcuts in search”, which will allow Android users (only in the US, for now) to access quick answers on a range of topics with the touch of a button. Fittingly, Google has termed these “tappable shortcuts” and they will lead searchers to instantaneous information on dozens of topics, including sports, restaurants, local amenities, and entertainment. The new feature is available within the Google app in the US, although users will have to upgrade the app to the latest version before the shortcuts are accessible. As Google continues its relentless release of new mobile-first products, this announcement is entirely aligned with the search engine’s strategy to keep pace with – and anticipate – trends in user behavior. Tappable shortcuts lend themselves to a search experience that is more open-ended in nature than traditional Google queries. Notably, they also remove a fundamental element of the Google experience: either typing or voicing a query. In a wider ecosystem that now includes maps, the knowledge graph, and structured data, it is understandable that Google has chosen to make this move now. With the addition to their fold of hardware like Google Home and the Pixel smartphones, combined with an upgraded Assistant on all Android phones, Google seems closer than ever to unifying the digital user journey. The following (very short) video was also released yesterday to demonstrate how ‘shortcuts in search’ will work: But will this initiative take off, what will it mean for SEO, and how will Google manage to integrate paid ads into this new search experience? Will Google convince users to get on board? The first phase will be to convince its vast user base to transition across to this way of discovering information. The actual functionality underpinning this change has not been updated; it is merely a more streamlined way to surface information. Google Now has offered access to many of these features for some time, but user behaviors can be slow to change. One could even suggest that this launch is Google giving a nudge to the public to show them just how much is possible through their products now. At SMX West yesterday, Google’s Jason Douglas summarised one of their core objectives as simply trying to find the “easiest way to help the user get things done.” No doubt, achieving that goal would go some way to convince people to take the small step of updating an app. A mass migration of users to this app would have myriad benefits for Google. By keeping users enclosed within its own ecosystem of information, Google gains access to their data and, just as crucially, keeps those users out of Facebook’s grasp. With machine learning at the core of everything Google does now, all of that data will only serve to improve the accuracy of search results, and those improved results will convince users to stay on the app. How will Google rank these results? This is an important question for SEO professionals, although it is a little early to answer it conclusively. Its degree of importance will also, of course, depend on just how many users elect to search by tapping on shortcuts. Intriguingly, Jason Douglas implied at SMX West yesterday that as part of the wider Actions on Google initiative, consumers will be able to set preferences, not just on their sports teams or favorite restaurants, but also on the brands they like most. Douglas went on to add: “We’re trying to decide now how sticky those preferences should be. In some cases, you can set some preferences in the app. We’re trying to learn as we go. For shopping, is it convenience or best price that matters most? There are a lot of new ranking and quality challenges.” The ramifications of that statement could be far-reaching, and it is understandable that Douglas chose to equivocate slightly on these points, refusing to take a definitive stance on such an important point. Nonetheless, it is certainly plausible that user ‘preferences’ on certain brands would factor into personalized organic search results. The advice to SEOs in that eventuality is as trite as it is true; all we can do is create great content and exceptional user experiences to ensure we make our way onto the preferred brands list. Will Google offer paid placements? Google has been open in stating that this new environment presents a huge challenge to its paid search business. Voice search is best suited to providing just one answer, which leaves little room for paid placements. The inherent complexities for an auction-based bidding model like AdWords in this scenario are subtle and difficult to disentangle, but this is especially true if users state an overt preference for one brand over another. For example, if a user has selected Kayak as a preferred flight aggregator over Skyscanner, how would that affect the price each would have to pay to rank first on that user’s travel searches? How would Google factor that into its auctions, at a grand scale? If Skyscanner did choose to pay an inflated rate for first position, how would that sit with the user, who no doubt would recall selecting Kayak as their preferred brand? These are challenges that Google is all too aware of, but there can be little doubt that ultimately, they will find a way to monetize this trend if it does take off.

We should expect any attempts to monetize this to be tentative at first – especially in the wake of the opprobrium raised by the recent ‘Ads on Google Home’ fiasco. That said, Google’s decision to make these updates has been driven by what it foresees to be a new way of discovering information. Therefore, we can first expect Google to entice users to use its new range of hardware and software through their ubiquity and ease of use, before making those first forays into transforming its paid search model to an interaction that no longer requires a user to search.

Over the weekend, the UK’s Sunday Times reported that up to 48m – or 15% – of the social media giant’s 319m users were in fact bots. That’s nearly twice the company’s own estimate that up to 8.5% of its accounts are managed by “bots”. The paper’s figure reflected a University of Southern California study, which estimates that between 9% and 15% of Twitter accounts “exhibit social bot behaviors”. The study describes “social bots” as social media accounts that, instead of being managed by humans, are using technology to emulate human behavior: “controlled by software, algorithmically generating content and establishing interactions”. The research team’s analysis revealed three distinct types of social bot: Legit-looking accounts that are promoting themselves, such as recruiters and porn performers. Spam accounts that are very active but have few followers. Accounts that automated applications to post content from other platforms, such as YouTube and Instagram, or post links to news articles. While bots are often seen in a negative light, the researchers acknowledged that many social bots have a positive role to play in society, performing useful functions such as disseminating news and publications and coordinating groups of volunteers. On the other hand, they also point out that these social bots are increasingly being used to … manufacture fake grassroots political support, promote terrorist propaganda and recruitment, manipulate the stock market, and disseminate rumors and conspiracy theories. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Twitter isn’t the only social media giant struggling with this problem. Last week, advertisers in the UK, including the UK government, boycotted Google after an investigation by The Times, sister paper to The Sunday Times, revealed that brands were being promoted next to jihadist videos on Google’s YouTube platform. Content from Mercedes-Benz and Marie Curie, among others, was being displayed next to content posted by supporters of Islamic State and other extremist groups. Since YouTube advertisements generate as much as $7.60 for their posters every 1,000 views, the brands were likely to have unwittingly channeled money to terrorist supporters. USA Today reports that Google has responded by promising to: Pull online ads from controversial content Give brands more control over where their ads appear Deploy more people to enforce its ad policy. Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer pledged in a blog post: Starting today, we’re taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content. He also confirmed that the company will be “developing new tools powered by its latest advancements in AI and machine learning” to help it review questionable content more quickly. Earlier today, The Drum reported that Twitter is also increasingly turning to automated technology to help it remove offensive material more quickly. Twitter, in fact, revealed this increased use of smart software in its biannual transparency report. This comes as Facebook rolls out a new alert capability in an attempt to combat fake news. The new feature, according to the Guardian, flags content as “disputed”. It was trialed on a story that falsely claimed thousands of Irish people were brought to the US as slaves. Attempting to share the story prompts a red alert stating the article has been disputed by both Snopes.com and the Associated Press. Whether it’s fake news, extremist content, stock market manipulation or bullying, the social media giants have a responsibility to do everything in their power to remove inappropriate content from their sites. Keeping up with the wrongdoers will be a constant battle, but if they want their business models to work, they must give advertisers confidence that their brand will be shown in the best light and users confidence that they are interacting with appropriate and legitimate content. We have yet to see whether they can keep up. Or are we seeing the beginning of the end of the social media era?

The only individuals seeming to be die-hard to use it are individuals who utilize it for the Anonymous movement, and they’re also the largest breakers of the TOS.

By Paola Totaro WASHINGTON, March 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Global technology giants such as Google and Facebook must join the battle for land rights and help spearhead an international campaign to eradicate insecurity of tenure as if it were an infectious disease, land experts told a World Bank conference. Stig Enemark, professor emeritus of Land Management at Denmark's Aalborg University, and British land reform expert Robin McLaren said only 30 percent of the world population is protected by official land administration systems leaving the vast majority vulnerable to eviction and displacement. They said the land sector needs to be more ambitious in its goals, calling for a campaign to seek security of tenure for 80 percent of people by 2030 and involving new players to support the fight for land rights. "The global eradication of infectious diseases through highly coordinated campaigns has been successful," the two men said in paper delivered at the World Bank's Land and Poverty Conference involving more than 1,200 land experts. "Although insecurity of tenure is not a disease, its impact is devastating in terms of trapping people in poverty, displacing communities and making them homeless, and reducing food security and creating hunger ... this is a human rights issue." Enemark and McLaren said at a time when some countries are turning inward and ignoring the global challenges of the 21st century, sparking renewed attention on communication and solving global land issues has become even more important. "Land professionals must not be complacent and need to re-think and re-shape their message, providing clearer evidence to politicians on the benefits of their land interventions and investments," McLaren told a panel discussion. "Global technology players such as Facebook and Google, for example, need to be encouraged to support this campaign to provide innovative technology solutions." HIGH TECH SOLUTIONS Facebook has already used artificial intelligence software to scan 14.6 billion satellite images to identify human-built structures in countries across Africa. The social media network plan to use this information to determine where drones offering internet connections could be best deployed. The data, say experts, if shared could also be applied to property rights projects. The digital platform, Tomnod, is also using artificial intelligence (AI) powered by crowdsourcing to automatically identify features of interest in satellite and aerial imagery. Tomnod, owned by Colorado-based satellite company DigitalGlobe, has led crowdsourcing campaigns that have attracted tens of thousands of volunteers around the globe, including work to map populations across Ethiopia. Enemark and McLaren said emerging technologies could be potential "game changers" for land administration. The United Nation's latest set of global goals, adopted in 2015, contain six goals relating to land, including a target for all men and women to have equal rights to ownership and control over land and other forms of property by 2030. "This new agenda presents a historic and unprecedented opportunity to bring the countries and citizens of the world together to decide and embark on new paths to improve the lives of people everywhere," McLaren said. "The perfect storm of change has arrived. The time is right to launch a global security of tenure campaign, but it requires strong political will."

In short: we’ve got too many tabs open to knuckle down and give one task our full attention. And that’s where monotasking comes in. Monotasking, or concentrating on a given task until it’s complete, has been heralded as the most effective performance and memory enhancing strategy since sliced bread. “Despite having access to Google, the iCloud and an app for everything, it seems we’ve never had so much to remember. With busy lives and hectic schedules we are always chasing our tails, planning what’s coming next while still worrying about what happened before,” says Dr. Jenny Brockis, who specializes in the science of high-performance thinking and brain health. The key, she says, to boosting your attention is to first identify and corral your distractions. Then apply your complete and undivided attention to one thing at a time. We quizzed the “Future Brain” author on how you can play this card to your advantage and up your attention span while you’re at it (but maybe take notes anyway.) How can we remember things better? Shutterstock   To remember something, anything, we have to create a memory, which starts with paying attention. Ah yes, attention, that brain function at increasing risk of extinction as it becomes more superficial, fleeting and fragmented. “Where is that urgent document I asked you for yesterday?” asks your boss. You’re sure you sent it – but did you? It was just as your colleague popped in to ask you a question and your phone was ringing. Oops, it’s still sitting in “Drafts.” Assuming you did pay attention to take in exactly where you put down your wallet, the second stage of forming a memory is encoding. This occurs at a subconscious level with the critical time being when we sleep. Our clever brain rapidly replays the days’ events, picking out the salient details it believes you are most interested in and want to keep for long-term storage. While you are sleeping your brain strengthens those synaptic connections required for that memory to last. Rehearsing and practicing your newly acquired memory whilst awake also helps. Giving your brain enough down time is essential to remember more. When not focused we default to a little mind wandering, the perfect opportunity for the mighty subconscious to start looking for associations and patterns and create more enduring memories. Plus sprinkling in a little extra emotion, especially the stronger ones helps strengthens memories too. Where exactly do we file a past memory? Shutterstock Our memories are not stored neatly in the filing cabinets of our mind but are broken down into their component parts and scattered across the cortex. When it comes time to recall an event these are then quickly reassembled to reform the whole, a potentially problematic time as that fragile memory can be easily lost or changed. We might remember that Tinder date from last June as having a red beard and glasses — whereas the reality might be he’s clean-shaven and blond. Why do we need to forget to remember? Shutterstock Forgetting is essential so the brain can continue to learn new information. While remembering some automated skills such as how to ride a bicycle or tie our shoelaces stays with us, let’s face it, we don’t need to remember what we learned in chemistry class in high school unless it is relevant to us now. Once more, sleep is critical to this process, loosening up those connections that no longer serve us, and creating more room for new ones to help us retain important current information. To remember more and recall what matters is about applying our full and undivided attention, taking regular brain breaks and getting enough sleep, and perhaps most importantly of all, staying in the present moment. Because that’s what’s most important to focus on right now. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on WHIMN.

The latest spy shots suggest the curvy flagship phones do away with the home button on the front. But the new phones won’t be entirely touchscreen-operated. This week, Samsung announced there will be a dedicated button for summoning Bixby, the company’s brand-new voice assistant. Bixby represents a major reboot for S Voice, the voice assistant you probably forgot Samsung already has. Introduced in 2012 with the Galaxy S III, S Voice was largely a “me-too” voice platform that launched the year after Siri. It wasn’t terrible, it just didn’t distinguish itself. But Bixby will (eventually) feature advanced AI that could leapfrog Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri when it comes to speech comprehension, and Samsung’s enormous scale could make it a dominant player in the emerging voice-assistant space. But even with a rock-solid voice foundation, Bixby will be playing catch-up for quite some time. Bossing your phone around with your voice is helpful, but no longer revolutionary. What Bixby really needs is a sense of purpose, something to make developers and hardware partners latch onto it like they’ve latched onto Alexa. Bixby at Birth In an announcement post on Samsung’s website, R&D chief InJong Rhee says Bixby’s first goal is bringing unprecedented voice navigation to your phone. Samsung promises deep voice integration at the OS level, and for some apps, your voice will be able to do anything a tap or a swipe can do. What that means in practice is still a mystery, but Rhee promises a unique, less frustrating voice assistant than the competition. Don’t expect much at the start. Samsung plans to launch an SDK so that third-party developers can get in on the action, but that will take some time. Alexa only just hit 10,000 apps, called “skills,” 18 months after its release. And Samsung faces a challenge Amazon doesn’t: The Galaxy S8 series almost certainly will run on Android Nougat, which means it may be competing against Google Assistant right there on the same phone. Bixby will have to work better, work differently, and prove itself uniquely useful to avoid being ignored right out of the box. Or it will require patience. Like most voice assistants, you can bet on Bixby getting smarter over time. Samsung bought voice-AI company Viv Labs last year, so look for that technology to underpin Bixby at some point. The big hook with Viv is that it’s a voice bot you can talk to like a normal human without getting useless results. Rhee argues that you need to use stilted, robotic syntax to make other assistants do anything. Instead, Bixby should adapt to you. “Natural-language interaction can always be improved,” says Patrick Moorhead, president and lead analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. “While everyone says they have it, the reality is that a user is better off learning the right syntax that makes it operate best. Making voice assistants respond with better in-context results can be improved, too. It seems like each query today starts the entire process over.” Moorhead says Samsung developed the first iteration of Bixby in-house, and will add Viv’s features over time. The ability to deliver useful results without tedious repetition or adjustments could make Bixby more than Just Another Voice Assistant in a crowded market. At the very least, Galaxy owners should finally have a capable and unique voice assistant on their devices. Bixby’s Next Steps But even if Bixby can process human speech more effectively—something that remains to be seen, given the head start Amazon, Google, and Apple enjoy—its competitors interact with far more devices. Alexa, Google Home, and Siri enjoy unique advantages that reflect each company’s strengths. “Amazon has the experience around e-commerce transactions,” says Werner Goertz, research director at Gartner. “They know a user’s buying behavior, they’ve already gathered all this information and created the contextualization. Google has the knowledge graph, the result of 20 years of Google searches. They’ve been able to identify facts and relationships between them. Even if Viv presents itself as a great AI agent, if it doesn’t have a similar base of facts from which to learn, it puts Bixby at a competitive disadvantage.” Samsung does have one advantage: It makes a ridiculous amount of stuff. It holds the largest share of the global television market, it holds a close second to Apple in the smartphone business, and it makes just about every appliance you can think of. You can see a world where Samsung puts Bixby in all of those things, or lets you control them via voice from your phone. Samsung also owns the SmartThings connected home platform, which already works with hundreds of third-party smart-home gadgets. Adding Bixby interaction to the SmartThings hub would help Samsung close the Alexa gap, but only for people that bought into that ecosystem. Making up for lost time requires getting Bixby into as many hands as possible as quickly as possible. Millions of people worldwide use a Galaxy phone. Every one of them is an entry point for Samsung’s voice assistant, making those legacy devices key to Bixby’s fast growth. But Goertz sees one problem there: That dedicated Bixby button. “This is clearly a button that isn’t on previous devices,” he says. “Can they retrofit some kind of soft version of this button? If this is a thing for the S8 only, that catch-up game is going to be even more difficult.”  However long it takes, that catch-up journey needs to start with a first step. If Bixby works as intuitively as advertised, at least Samsung has some solid footing. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. bixby Samsung voice assistants Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Updated March 22, 2017 9:34AM SHARE ALSO SEE Google Alphabet Search Engine Mobile Apps Smartphone YouTube An organization affiliated with Google is offering tools that news organizations and election-related sites can use to protect themselves from hacking. Jigsaw, a research arm of Google parent company Alphabet Inc., says that free and fair elections depend on access to information. To ensure such access, Jigsaw says, sites for news, human rights and election monitoring need to be protected from cyberattacks. Jigsaw's suite of tools, called Protect Your Election, is mostly a repackaging of existing tools: -- Project Shield will help websites guard against denial-of-service attacks, in which hackers flood sites with so much traffic that legitimate visitors can't get through. Users of Project Shield will be tapping technology and servers that Google already uses to protect its own sites from such attacks. -- Password Alert is software that people can add to Chrome browsers to warn them when they try to enter their Google password on another site, often a sign of a phishing attempt. -- 2-Step Verification helps beef up security beyond passwords by requiring a second access code, such as a text sent to a verified cellphone. Though Jigsaw directs users to turn this on for Google accounts, most major rivals offer similar protections, too. "This is as much an occasion to have a conversation about digital security as it is putting all the tools in one place," Jigsaw spokesman Dan Keyserling said. While the tools can be useful to a variety of groups and individuals, Jigsaw says it is focusing on elections because cyberattacks often increase against news organizations and election information sites around election time. In particular, Jigsaw wants to help sites deploy the tools ahead of the French presidential elections, which begin April 23. The tools are free, though Project Shield is limited to news organizations, individual journalists, human-rights groups and election-monitoring organizations. It's not known whether the tools might have prevented some of the high-profile attacks in the past, including the theft of emails from Democratic Party computers during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The tools do not directly address such break-ins, but they could help guard against password stealing, a common precursor to break-ins. © 2017 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

MORE IN SECURITY SOLUTIONS How To Elude Russian Hackers WikiLeaks Shows Encryption Works Smart Devices Dunces About Security CIA's Opinion of Antivirus Programs SAP HANA Now Aboard Google Cloud Next Article > How To Elude Russian Hackers with Decent Password Security By Mae Anderson. Updated March 20, 2017. Details from the Department of Justice indictment of Russian hackers on Wednesday show that many people are still not taking routine precautions to safeguard their email accounts -- and hackers are exploiting that. The Russian hackers didn't have to work very hard to break into people's email accounts, even those belonging to government officials or powerful executives. Here's a look at a few simple ways to help safeguard your email account from hackers. Don't Reuse Passwords Many online break-ins result when people have reused a password across, say, their email, social and financial accounts. If it's compromised at any one of those services, the others are suddenly vulnerable. One simple way to avoid this problem is to start with a base password you can remember, and then add on letters and numbers that reference where you're using it. If your base password is "greatsurfer2017" (which isn't particularly secure; more on that in a moment), you could make "greatsurfer2017Y" your Yahoo password, and "greatsurfer2017G" your Google password. If you can't be bothered to do more, this is a base level of security that can help shield you from the most obvious threats. But it's still only a baby step. Pick a Stronger Password You can make things harder for attackers by making your base password stronger. The more complicated and lengthy a password is, the harder it will be for hackers to guess. The downside: Tougher passwords are also harder to remember. But there are some ways around that. Don't include your kids' names, birthdays or references to any other personal details. Hackers routinely troll Facebook and Twitter for clues to passwords like these. Obvious and default passwords such as "Password123" are also bad, as are words commonly found in dictionaries, as these are used in programs hackers have to automate guesses. You can make your own strong passwords with randomly capitalized nonsense words interspersed with numbers and characters -- like, say, "giLLy31!florp." (Just don't use that one now that it's appeared in this story.) So long as you're making up the words yourself, these are difficult for hackers to crack -- and they're easier to remember than you might think, though you might want to practice them a few times. Have Your Passwords Managed for You Of course, you can make things easier on yourself by using a password-manager service such as LastPass or DashLane, which keep track of multiple complex passwords for you. Some web browsers such as Apple's Safari and Google's Chrome also have built-in password managers; these work if you switch devices, but not if you switch browsers. After you create a strong password for your password manager, it can create random passwords for your other accounts -- and will remember them for you as well. "It's more secure and it makes your life easier," said Jamie Winterton, director of strategy at the Global Security Initiative at Arizona State University. Multifactor Authentication Is a Must The next line of defense is two- or multifactor authentication, which asks users to enter a second form of identification, such as a code texted to their phone, when they log in. It's now commonplace for many email and social media accounts. That way, even if hackers manage to get your password they still need your phone with the texted code. "Having another way for that account to say 'Hey, is that really you?', and give veto authority is really important," Winterton said. Keywords Matter According to the indictment, the Russian hackers searched email accounts for keywords like "passwords" to find people's passwords for other accounts. They also searched for "credit card" "visa," among other terms. So think twice before you use common key words that can serve as a road map to sensitive information for hackers. And don't save passwords in old emails. "There's not one single thing out there that can keep you perfectly safe," Winterton said. "But there are a lot of different things out there that can keep you almost perfectly safe." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Not only do you have to set a time and place to meet, but you also have to also make sure everyone knows how to get there. Thankfully, Google is trying to make that process easier for you by adding a feature to Google Maps that allows you to share your real-time location and trip progress with friends and family… Announced in a blog post, a new “Share location” button will soon show up within the Google Maps mobile applications. When you click on this, you will be taken to another screen where you will be able to select contacts that you wish to share your location with as well as how long you want to share. On the receiving end, as long as they have Google Maps installed, they should get a push notification letting them know that your location is being shared with them. Simply opening the notification allows them to not only see your location but also in return share their exact coordinates. If you’re running late and what to give your friends of family real-time updates on your trip, you can now also share your trip progress. While using the navigation feature, simply tap on the “More” button found at the bottom of the display and then select “Share trip.” Those viewing your trip will get to follow your location in real-time as well as see an expected arrival time. When using this feature, the location sharing turns off automatically once you’ve reached your destination. This real-time location sharing functionality will be rolling out to Android and iOS users worldwide soon. Once it does, recipients of your location will be able to see your whereabouts from the Google Maps app on Android and iOS, as well as on the mobile web and desktop version of Maps.

Meanwhile, Google Allo adds the ability to share files, as well as a machine learning-powered feature to find the right emoji and sticker more quickly. These features are launching first in Brazil, with international rollout in the next few days. Aimed at situations where there is a poor network connection, Duo will now allow users to switch to audio-only calls. Google notes that audio calls work “well on all connection speeds” and is data efficient. According to earlier teardowns, the interface works by swiping down on the main screen of the app to reveal a video/audio toggle. Sliding towards the latter setting brings up a screen where users can start a call. This feature is launching in Brazil starting today, with the rest of the world seeing it in the next few days for Android and iOS. Highly requested in countries like Brazil, Google Allo is adding the ability share documents in group chats. File formats include pdf, .docs, .apk, .zip, and mp3. Additionally, Allo is adding a new Smart Smiley feature that uses machine learning to help pick the right in context emoji. Tapping the new icon on the compose bar will suggest relevant emojis and stickers. File sharing is live starting today for Android users around the world, while Smart Smiley is launching only for Portuguese in Brazil.

More organizations and celebrities can now post on Google with Posts on Google Posted 21 hours ago by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Plug and Play launches 9 new accelerator programs Posts on Google started out as an experiment during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It essentially allowed candidates to post Twitter-like status updates directly to Google’s search results pages and those updates would then appear in various election- and candidate-related widgets. As the company announced at an event in Brazil today, it’s now opening this feature up to a wider range of organizations and individuals. Now don’t get too excited just yet. Google is opening up an application process and that process currently focuses on museums, sports teams, sports leagues and movies (and the people and organizations behind them). The idea here, Google says, is that when you search for a given museum, for example, you’ll see updates that give you more info about exhibits or other timely info. In Brazil, Posts on Google is now also open to musicians and it’s probably only a matter of time before Google will bring this to the United States. The company says it’s continuing to experiment with other categories and regions, too. During the U.S. election, Google allowed the candidates to publish long-form text, links, photos and videos. It looks like that’s still the kind of content Google is looking for from these new organizations. While the term “status update” is clearly linked to social networking, it doesn’t look like this is yet another attempt by Google to launch a social network. Instead, it’s meant to provide more relevant and timely information to its users. Once upon a time, Google would have pushed these users to Google+ and asked them to post their updates there.

Or you are trying to meet up with people in a crowded venue and just can't find the people you are looking for? It can get tedious to continually text back and forth with either your ETA or your exact location. But a new Google Maps feature will take over for you, and let your friends either know exactly where you are, or exactly when you'll arrive. So how does it work? In IT Blogwatch, we're running late.  What exactly is going on? Julia Love has some background: Google announced...that it will revamp its popular maps app to allow users to share their locations...Within the next week, users worldwide will be able to share where they are in real time on devices running both...Android...and...iOS...The location-sharing feature is aimed at helping people find each other in crowded places, such as concerts and conferences. And how does it work? Michael Liedtke explains: Google believes the...tool will be a...convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without having to text or call...Maps users...activate the location-sharing feature by tapping a button near the search bar and then picking a person from their contact list to text with the information. If the recipient doesn't have the Google Maps app on their phone, it will text them a link to open the location on the map in a browser. ... The settings...allow users to determine how long their movements can be tracked each time a location is shared. If no time limit is selected, Google will periodically send people email reminders that they're still sharing their location. Can it do anything else? Thorin Klosowski has those details: More useful is sharing your ETA on a trip. To do this, start navigation, then tap...More...at the bottom of the screen. Tap Share Trip and select the friends you want to send your ETA to. You’ll stop sharing your location the second you arrive at your destination. So what does all this mean for Google? Richard Nieva is in the know: The announcement underscores the company's...ambition for Google Maps to be more than just a destination for maps and directions. With more than a billion users, it's become a tool for local recommendations, real-time info on how busy a restaurant is, and a cheat sheet to remember where you parked your car. But are there any downsides to the new feature? Tess Townsend highlights a pretty big one: Location sharing...could raise all kinds of privacy concerns. The links, for example, can be shared on to anyone else through a simple copy and paste, whether or not the original user intended their information to be known to a wider circle. ... Additionally...location sharing could be a problem in an abusive relationship where one person could demand the other keep the feature turned on, making it easier for them to track their whereabouts. So, ultimately, does this make sense for everyone? Tony isn't so sure: How nice for people who have friends.

New Google Maps feature will let users share their ETA and progress in real-time. (Screenshot via YouTube) Google Maps is rolling out a new feature that lets you send your location and ETA to friends in real time. The tool, announced Wednesday, can share a real-time location and trip progress when you’re navigating with Google Maps. You can share your real-time location with Google Contacts or send a link using other messaging apps. The tool prompts you to set how long you want to share your whereabouts with a friend. The sharing tool will be available on the Google Maps apps for Android and iOS. It isn’t clear when location sharing will be available to all users; Google says it will begin “rolling out soon worldwide.” I wasn’t able to pull up location sharing on my Google Maps app in Seattle but it appears to be available in some regions. Real-time location sharing is nothing new (Seattle-based Glympse has been offering it for years) but big tech companies have historically been wary of the technology because of the creepiness factor. They don’t want to alienate users with anything that seems like it could violate their privacy or safety. That’s likely the reason Google built an expiration time into its location sharing features. This way, users won’t forget they’ve shared their location with someone. As for third-party apps that provide location sharing to those who want it, Google could be a tough competitor. But Glympse, for one, isn’t shaking in its boots. “The surprise isn’t that others have jumped into the space we created, only that it’s taken so long,” said Glympse CEO Bryan Trussel. “In the past few years Uber, Apple, Lyft, (and now Google Maps) have added some variation of real-time location sharing to their apps. As this has happened, we have seen our usage increase at a stronger pace and fully expect that trend to continue.” Monica Nickelsburg handles a variety of editorial roles, including social media, site production, and the Geek Life beat. Originally from Southern California, she studied journalism and history at NYU before landing in Seattle. She loves arts, pop-culture, and her adopted city.

The developer preview of the new version is available now. In a similar vein to Chrome 57, Android O is focused on extending battery life and throttling background tasks. Android's ever-evolving notification system is getting improvements and will now group notification content into app-defined categories called channels. To keep background tasks in check, Android O will impose limitations on implicit broadcasts, background services, and location updates in order to make it easier for developers to write apps with reduced impact on battery life. Google says the policy changes on background limits represent a "significant change" and that it "want(s) every developer to get familiar with them," which sounds to us like a heads-up indicating that the changes may break some applications. The latest round of changes to the notification system offers apps the ability for apps to create what Google calls channels. The change should allow users more fine-grained control over each type of notification originating from an app. Google says the new system will allow users to "block or change the behavior of each channel individually," instead of just enabling or disabling the entirety of an app's notifications. Android O will arrive with improved support for both new and existing hardware. Wide-gamut displays will be supported, as will the higher-quality Bluetooth LDAC audio codec. As for existing hardware, the musty old keyboard-and-mouse interfaces are getting some attention to make the Android app experience a bit more satisfying for users of Android apps on Chrome OS devices. The new release includes a number of smaller updates like a new Autofill API, updated application windowing features, and adaptive icons. Google's Android Developers blog has a more detailed rundown here. The search giant is planning a deeper release of information at Google I/O in mid-May, but developers can download the preview version and get started updating their apps right away.

The location-monitoring feature will begin rolling out today in an update to the Google Maps mobile app, which is already installed on most of the world’s smartphones. It will also be available on personal computers. Google believes the new tool will be a more convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without having to text or call them. The Mountain View, California, company has set up the controls so individuals can decide with whom they want to share their whereabouts and for how long — anywhere from a few minutes to indefinitely. But location sharing in one of the world’s most popular apps could cause friction in marriages and other relationships if one partner demands to know where the other is at all times. Similar tensions could arise if parents insist their teenagers turn on the location-sharing option before they go out. Similar tracking is already available on other apps; Glympse, founded by former Microsoft employees, has offered this function for years. That’s one of the reasons Google isn’t expecting a lot of complaints about adding the option to Maps, especially since everyone can decide when to turn it on and who can monitor them. “We don’t feel like we are changing the game,” said Jen Fitzpatrick, Google’s vice president of maps. Maps users will be able to activate the location-sharing feature by tapping a button near the search bar and then picking a person from their contact list to text with the information. If the recipient doesn’t have the Google Maps app on their phone, it will text them a link to open the location on the map in a browser. The settings also allow users to determine how long their movements can be tracked each time a location is shared. If no time limit is selected, Google will periodically send people email reminders that they’re still sharing their location.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars APPS Google updates Allo with file sharing, Duo with audio calling, and Photos with low connectivity features Emil Protalinski@EPro March 22, 2017 8:35 AM Tags: Google, Google Allo, Google Duo, Google Maps, Google Search, Google+ Photos, top-stories Above: Google signage Image Credit: Ken Yeung / VentureBeat At an event in São Paulo, Brazil today, Google announced a slew of updates to its various apps. On top of implementing location sharing in Google Maps, the company also added new features to Google Allo, Google Duo, and Google Photos. Google Allo for Android has gained the ability to share documents and other files (.pdf, .doc, .apk, .zip, and .mp3). For users in Brazil, Allo is getting Smart Smiley in Portuguese. When the feature first arrived in November, it was English-only, though Google promised to add more languages. Now it’s finally delivering. Just tap the Smart Smiley button as you’re typing a message, and Allo will use machine learning to suggest relevant emojis and stickers. Google Duo for Android and iOS has gained audio-only calling — available first to users in Brazil and rolling out to users around the world “in the coming days.” When video calling isn’t an option, whether you’re on a poor network connection or simply in a crowded area, Duo now lets you place a basic voice call. Google promises that “Duo audio calls work well on all connection speeds and won’t eat up your data.” Google Photos for Android and iOS has gained low-connectivity backup and sharing features. Your photos will now back up automatically in a “lightweight preview quality” on 2G connections. When a good Wi-Fi connection becomes available, your backed-up photos will be replaced with high-quality versions. The same applies to sharing: On low connectivity, you can now share pictures quickly by sending a low-resolution version first, and the higher-resolution version will arrive when connectivity permits. Finally, Google Search is also getting a small update today. During the U.S. election last year, Google started letting select users post directly on search results for people and places. Now the company is expanding the application process to organizations and people in the U.S. and Brazil within specific categories. When you perform a Google search for museums, sports teams, sports leagues, movies, and musicians (Brazil-only), you can see content from that participating organization or person. Think of it like social updates in Google Search without the Google+. Google also made some Brazil-specific announcements today: Google Assistant rolling out in Brazilian Portuguese on Android phones running Marshmallow or Nougat, a $5 million Google.org grant to the Lemann Foundation for a tech-based education project in Brazil, bringing the São Paulo Museum of Art to Google Arts & Culture, and plans to roll out Waze Carpool in Brazil later this year. It’s uncommon for Google to host an event outside of the U.S. with announcements that affect more than just that country. But in this case, Google said these updates are arriving thanks to extensive research into features tailored to people’s needs in “mobile-first countries,” a strategy which the company believes results in “great products for everyone, everywhere.” ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Google Posts now gives museums, movies, musicians & sports groups dedicated space in search Program opens in US and Brazil. Expansion is a sign Google no longer sees it as just an experiment. Danny Sullivan on March 22, 2017 at 10:00 am More Museums, musicians, movies, sports teams and sports leagues are now being given a special area for their content to appear in Google’s search results, through an expansion of the “Posts by Google” program. Posts by Google — more commonly called Google Posts — launched last year as an experimental way for selected groups to post information directly on Google’s servers, which in turn appeared in a dedicated area of Google’s search results for relevant queries. Google Posts originally involved US presidential candidates and expanded to a small group of local businesses. Today’s news is an even bigger expansion, opening up the feature to museums, movies, sports leagues and sports teams in the US and Brazil. Musicians in Brazil can also apply. Share text, images, video & animated GIFs Several organizations are already taking part. For example, here’s The Henry Ford museum: The “Posted by owner” section is where content from the museum appears. This is all posted directly to Google’s servers. You can see all the content the museum has posted here. Posts can contain images, video, and even animated GIFs. By the way, if you don’t see the example above or some of those below, try searching on mobile versus desktop. I couldn’t get any to trigger on desktop. Another special unit for already crowded results Google Posts do not replace other units that appear on the search results, such as the regular web listings, local information, the top stories box, tweets from an organization or other material. Nor are Google Posts guaranteed to be at the top of the page. They might appear anywhere, as this example for NCAA basketball league posts shows. Hang in there — it’s big! Did you make it through that? Personally, I find it overwhelming having Google Posts added to search results like this that are already overloaded with special units. Some baseball teams using Google Posts Here’s an example for Boston Red Sox posts: A quick spot-check reveals the New York Yankees, the San Francisco Giants and last year’s World Series champions, the Chicago Cubs, are all Major League Baseball teams making use of Google Posts (as is the MLB itself). Orange County’s Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are not, that I can see, to my disappointment. Go team! Supposedly only US and Brazil national level teams and leagues are allowed to use the service. However, both Liverpool Football Club and Manchester City — English football teams — have accounts. Meanwhile, previous support for cricket appears to be gone. Musicians are allowed to make use of the service, but only for those in Brazil for now, Google says. Here’s an example for Vanessa da Mata: Getting going with Google Posts Google hasn’t said how many new organizations have already been added to the service, but we’ll update if we get a figure. A search suggests there may be up to 34,000 organizations of various types using it right now. Google confirmed to Search Engine Land that experiments for US presidential candidates is over (and accounts run by the Clinton and Trump campaigns are gone). Google also said that other past experiments for awards shows, TV shows, music festivals and Fashion Week have ended. In some cases, the accounts may be gone. In other cases, as with the Oscars, content might remain. Google told Search Engine Land that any of these, and perhaps others, might return as deemed in the future. As for the small business program, Google confirmed to us that this remains active. Indeed, some in the program from the beginning like Escape Pod Comics and A Healthy Choice Massage and Day Spa, continue to post to the service. Right now, the best advice for small businesses that are interested seem to be to use the the application form and select the “Other” option. For more information about the program, see the Google Posts home page, which in turn leads to the application form. Google says turnaround time for an answer is about a week. You can also see Google’s blog post today about the expansion.

Google site search is on the way out. Now what? With Google sunsetting its site search product, many companies are wondering where to turn for this functionality. Columnist Paul Shapiro provides some alternatives. Paul Shapiro on March 22, 2017 at 10:14 am More Spring has sprung, and Google has started off the season with some spring cleaning of its service lineup. They’ve recently announced that Google Site Search is on the way out. Come April 1, 2017, Google will discontinue sales and new renewals of the service, and a year later, April 1, 2018, the service will be completely shut down. So, what’s the big deal? Search is search, right? The short answer: no. The longer answer is a little more complex, but still easy enough to understand from an end user’s point of view. While not everyone utilizes website search features, those who do are looking for something specific and expect to find answers quickly and easily. If people are on your website and using the search feature, they are obviously interested in what you have to say or in what you’re selling, so catering to them is important. If your search function is weak, users may leave your site, meaning you’re losing a fan, a lead and a customer — and in 2017, that is simply unacceptable. Google Site Search was an easy-to-implement, safe bet that provided Google-level search within your website. Website owners knew what they were getting, and users felt comfortable using the feature. Now what? Before you start scrambling to find a suitable replacement, let’s talk a bit about what led us to this point and where you can feasibly go from here. What are current customers losing, and what other options are available for website search functions?  Trust us, it’s not as bad as it seems. What are Google Site Search customers losing? Let’s talk a bit about what Google Site Search (GSS) accomplished before going into viable alternatives. Google Site Search was essentially Google for your personal website. With some tweaking and the use of XML, you could have all of the power of Google, with none of the Google branding or traditional ads normally associated with Google, all integrated into your website. Ease of implementation has been one of the great features of GSS; with just a couple of lines of code, websites had the power of Google in their search bar. GSS also included options for multilingual searches and date biasing, meaning the most relevant results were always at the top. That being said, GSS used Google’s same crawling feature, meaning that updates to your website weren’t always updated in search right away, but instead could take several days. Google Custom Search If you’re dead-set on staying with Google, options are still available, but those options may not suit your needs, depending on the size and scope of your business. With Google Custom Search, your customers can search from a group of websites of your choosing or search the entire web, at the great cost of free. With that free price tag come some stipulations, however. For one, ads are required, unless you are a non-profit or a school, but you can connect your AdSense account to monetize the ads. Also, the Google branding is required; nothing you can do about it. There are also monthly search query limits, so if you’re running a high-traffic website, there’s a good chance your Google Custom Search will stop working due to hitting search limits. Simply put, Google Custom Search is a great solution for small blogs, and maybe even local businesses, but if you’re already scaling on a large level — or plan on advertising at state, country or global level — Google Custom Search will not fit all of your needs. If you fall into this group, you need to start looking at third-party solutions for search. Here’s an overview of the differences you can expect between Google Site Search and the free Custom Search: Third-party solutions You’re not limited to Google when it comes to search services for your website. A lot of companies care about SEO, but the key is also finding ones that understand that the user experience also has to be top-notch if you want to keep people using your search features and, in turn, your website. That’s where third-party solutions like Algolia, Cludo and Swiftype come into play. All three of these companies do a great job of maximizing the search experience for your website’s visitors. Check out more details about each (as well as other solutions) below. AddSearch: Finland-based startup AddSearch is one option for your website search needs. Offering easy installation and mobile support, your search will be up and running in no time and working smoothly on any device. AddSearch also offers search statistics and result control, allowing webmasters to choose and prioritize which results are most important. Algolia: A well-funded SaaS search company that is already working with major names like Medium, Product Hunt, Twitch and Birchbox, Algolia can integrate into almost any website to offer seamless, fast search. With keystroke forgiveness, find-as-you-type live search and geolocation options, your users will be able to find exactly what they’re looking for, regardless of device or location. Algolia realizes that the shutdown of Google Site Search will leave many users feeling helpless, “For website owners, GSS was a jack-of-all-trades solution, notoriously easy to set up and as powerful as you’d expect a Google search product to be. From website crawling to the actual search UI, everything was handled automatically — all you needed was a small snippet of code. GSS will be dearly missed, if only for the fact that no technical skills were required to go live with a powerful search,” says Sylvain Utard, of Algolia. With developer-friendly API choices and multiple CMS platform integrations, Algolia will be right at home on your website, regardless of your platform, but will almost certainly require a developer to help integrate the service. The results are fantastic, however, and your custom search will provide users unparalleled search results. This is thanks in part to Algolia’s advanced navigation and search refinement that allows you to set up an Amazon-like refinement sidebar. Amazon CloudSearch: One of the more robust services available, CloudSearch is going to be one of the more difficult ones to set up on your website, with on-site searches requiring you to set up a crawler. Basically, you’re going to want to a developer to set up this service for you. With more options than Google, ACS charges based on use, with smaller plans running around $50 per year. Apache Solr: Another option available for search, Solr is an open-source enterprise platform built on Apache Lucene. Solr is scalable to fit any high-traffic website, with distributed indexing and load-balanced querying, Solr is the trusted search provider for a number of large businesses, including Sears, eHarmony and BestBuy. Solr features comprehensive administration features, easy-to-understand analytics and advanced full-text search options. Cludo: Another search company available to almost anyone, Cludo wants you to know that you have nothing to worry about if you’re migrating from Google Site Search to a third-party solution. “We do most of the work on our side so that you receive a personalized search solution that fits your needs. We will design the search in accordance to your site’s style, and make sure that relevancy is tuned just for your organization. All you have to do is to copy and paste a few scripts and your fully functional search will be up and running,” states Cludo’s most recent blog post. Cludo helps add relevance to your search results by including automatic spell-checking into user searches that check against spelling errors, common synonyms, alternate spelling and word derivatives. Cludo also includes analytic reports to give you better insights into what your users are searching for and how they are searching. Information included in the report includes most-used keywords, trending search results and “no results.” Having information on “no result” searches lets you know what your users are searching for and what content you can look into including in the future. Swiftype: Another option to consider when looking for search for your website is Swiftype. Swiftype is trusted by many websites, including CBS, AOL and AT&T. When comparing GSS with Google Custom Search, Swiftype writes on their blog, “There are much fewer customization options with Google CSE — not just visually, but more importantly in the ability to control the way your content is displayed. While you can tweak little things like link colors, there isn’t much you can customize beyond that. The overall experience still looks and feels like Google, not your own.” Offering many of the things the other two examples advertise, including the ability to make their search platform look like your own and analytics, Swiftype uses an advanced search algorithm based on language modeling intelligence that takes into account factors like bigram matching and stemming. Bigram matching deals with spacing (things like highheels vs high heels) and hyphenation that might sometimes bring back bad results on less advanced search services. Stemming removes suffixes from words, so that search root words match each other. Faceted search through Swiftype gives users even more control over their searches on your website by allowing them to refine different search attributes. Things like date, price, location, content type and author can all be used to tweak searches. There is also the option available to search by “Last Updated,” meaning your users are always getting the most up-to-date results. Conclusion It’s honestly pretty surprising to see the shuttering of Google Site Search, and there are sure to be quite a few websites out there scrambling to find a new search provider, but if the examples above are any indication, there are plenty of viable options for website owners to choose from; it’s simply a matter of deciding which one works best for you. If you are insistent on staying with a Google product, Google Custom Search is available for use, free of charge, but does not offer the customization that many websites need. If more control over your search platform is needed, however, there are multiple third-party options available, including Algolia, Cludo and Swiftype. While all offer similar features, they do have unique features that may suit your website better than the others. The key is to do your research, understand what your visitors need from your search functions, and choose your service appropriately.

The new feature will allow users to share their real-time location with friends and family. In order to share your location, you simply need to open the side menu or tap the blue dot that pin-points your current location in Google Maps. Then, you need to tap on the “Share location” option and select the people that you would like to receive information of your whereabouts. You can send your location to Google contacts, or share a link on messenger applications installed on your phone. When a location is shared, receivers will be able to view your exact location on the map. There’s also an icon above the compass, reminding you that the location was shared. In order to avoid any privacy issues, you can stop sharing your location at any time. Share your current location and ETA This is not all, Google also added the feature to the navigation section, so that you can share your location and let people know your estimated arrival time. They can also follow you toward your destination. Google Maps can share user location Google has announced that location sharing on Maps will start rolling out worldwide soon, for both Android and iOS apps, as well as the desktop platform. The new feature does come in handy when checking to see if a friend arrived safely home or when you want to let your friends know what you’re up to. Google constantly brings updates to its most important applications. Recently, the company added tappable shortcuts to Search in the Google app, thus changing the way people search for information on their phones.

News & Analysis Google Calls for Optical Leaps Exec wants 10x capacity, 2x cost reductions Rick Merritt 3/22/2017 12:05 PM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — Optical technologies need to take significant steps forward to keep up with demand from big data centers, said a Google executive. Urs Hölzle, vice president of technical infrastructure at Google, called for 2x cost reductions, 10x capacity gains, and more programmability in a keynote at the annual OFC event but gave few specifics on how to get there. The talk once again underscored how big data centers are pushing the limits of communications technology. Ironically, the web giants are extreme both in their growth and in their sensitivity to cost, putting pressure on chip, component, and system makers. “Things have been great for the last five years, but we’re rapidly approaching a wall, so we’re looking for step-function changes, not incremental changes,” Hölzle said. “We see 2x growth in nearly all the [optical] markets — that’s true in the data center, in campus/metro networks where we connect data centers for storage replication, and to get to the Net and in the WAN where we deliver apps,” he said. The demand is partly driven by what Hölzle called a new generation of cloud services that Google is offering based on the latest level of virtualization. “You never see a specific server or disk; you just provide data and queries. We pick the number and kind of machines, so you don’t have to worry about machine details,” he said. “To keep the illusion of server-less computing, we need high-performance, high-capacity networks.” Specifically, Hölzle called for more simplicity through automation in the design of optical modules, lower-cost undersea cables with greater redundancy, and support for programmable control planes that span optical and copper nets. A single duct between Google data centers packs multiple cables rich in optical fibers. (Images: Google) “The optics industry today is still more of an artisan craft,” he said, noting pluggable modules that look like USB sticks. Each network switch may use dozens of these modules and Google probably owns thousands of such switches. While not providing any specifics, he called for module makers to take a lesson from the integration and automation of the semiconductor industry. “The existing way of terminating fiber doesn’t work. Please build me a robot that terminates fiber — and it only has to be right 99% of the time,” he said.

SECURITY Google Will Let Other People Track Your Location (With Your Permission) Google Maps is rolling out a new feature that allows users to broadcast their movements to others. By Michael Liedtke Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Google Maps users will soon be able to broadcast their movements to friends and family via the app -- the latest test of how much privacy people are willing to sacrifice in an era of rampant sharing. The location-monitoring feature will begin rolling out Wednesday in an update to the Google Maps mobile app, which is already installed on most of the world's smartphones. It will also be available on personal computers. Google believes the new tool will be a more convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without having to text or call them. The Mountain View, California, company has set up the controls so individuals can decide with whom they want to share their whereabouts and for how long -- anywhere from a few minutes to indefinitely. But location sharing in one of the world's most popular apps could cause friction in marriages and other relationships if one partner demands to know where the other is at all times. Similar tensions could arise if parents insist their teenagers turn on the location-sharing option before they go out. Similar tracking is already available on other apps; Glympse, founded by former Microsoft employees, has offered this function for years. That's one of the reasons Google isn't expecting a lot of complaints about adding the option to Maps, especially since everyone can decide when to turn it on and who can monitor them. "We don't feel like we are changing the game," said Jen Fitzpatrick, Google's vice president of maps. Maps users will be able to activate the location-sharing feature by tapping a button near the search bar and then picking a person from their contact list to text with the information. If the recipient doesn't have the Google Maps app on their phone, it will text them a link to open the location on the map in a browser. The settings also allow users to determine how long their movements can be tracked each time a location is shared. If no time limit is selected, Google will periodically send people email reminders that they're still sharing their location. --The Associated Press Published on: Mar 22, 2017 Advertisement
